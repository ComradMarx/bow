        Bud Walton Arena has “served us well” as home of the Arkansas Razorback basketball teams since it opened 30 years ago, but it is now “somewhat tired and in need of renovation,” University of Arkansas Athletic Director Hunter Yurachek told the University of Arkansas System board of trustees Tuesday. During a meeting of the trustees at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Yurachek presented three possible scenarios for renovating the facility that opened in November 1993, but he stressed those are from a “very preliminary feasibility study, [and] are only concepts right now.” The university will look for an architect and general contractor to work together on design possibilities, Yurachek said. By having the architect work alongside the general contractor, “wed get an idea of pricing,” as opposed to “the architect designing a building you love but cant afford.” Yurachek plans to present an architect and general contractor for approval by the trustees this summer, then — in January or March of 2024 — bring a recommendation with details of the potential renovation to the trustees for approval, he said. Under that timeline, work could begin on the arena in March 2025 with an “ideal” grand opening in November 2026, but “wed have to be very fortunate to hit all these dates.” Read Wednesday's Arkansas Democrat-Gazette for more details.

        Its safe to say that class of 2025 4-star defensive back CJ Jimcoily had a good visit to Arkansas on Tuesday and is eager to make a return visit in the future. Jimcoily, 6-3, 190 pounds, of Nashville (Tenn.) Lipscomb Academy and three teammates visited the Hogs. He has offers from Arkansas, Tennessee, Ole Miss, Michigan, Maryland, Missouri, Louisville, Auburn, Kentucky and others.  He said co-defensive coordinator Marcus Woodson and secondary coach Deron Wilson and others at Arkansas made the visit successful.  “I got to talk to coach Woodson and coach Wilson, and I got to watch film with them and get to know them as people,” said Jimcoily, whos rated a 4-star recruit by Rivals. “Understanding the culture in the community.” Jimcoilys conversation with coach Sam Pittman also impressed.  “I chopped up with him a little bit,” he said. “Talked a little about football but actually about my life. He told me he wasnt planning on leaving soon at all, so that was cool to hear.”  Watching practice and touring the campus gave him a good vibe.  “Man, this visit was spectacular,” Jimcoily said.  Arkansas is looking at him as a safety and cornerback. He gave a rundown of what else stood out about the trip.  “Besides the people, the photo shoot was cool,” he said. “We got to watch film with the coaches, too, so that was something different, being able to see how they operate on the next level.”  The staff pointed out the businesses in Northwest Arkansas, with Fortune 500 companies like Wal Mart and JB Hunt.  “So there were a lot of wow factors, and then the cherry on top was the people,” Jimcoily said. “How they carried themselves and how they spoke about their program.”  Defensive analyst Nicholas Mathews made sure Jimcoily was taken care of during the trip.  “He was one of the first coaches I met up with and one of the last coaches I met up with before I left, so he was real cool,” Jimcoily said.  Woodsons connections and Wilsons teachings found favor with Jimcoily.  “Coach Woodson, of course, knows what hes talking about. He has connections in the NFL, I hear, so I know he has experience,” Jimcoily said. “I know if I was to come to Arkansas he can get me right. Coach Wilson, I got to watch film with him. He definitely knows ball. He walked me through some basic foundation things but also started ... telling me the concepts they ran.”  Jimcoily said hes ready to get back to Fayetteville.  “I would definitely like to get out here again,” he said. “This was a great experience.” Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        State Treasurer Mark Lowery is recovering at home following some health-related concerns, his office announced Tuesday afternoon. Lowery, a Republican from Maumelle, has been undergoing tests and will follow the instruction of his doctors, the treasurers office said in a news release. “A full recovery is expected, and he will return to his in-person duties very soon,” the treasurers office said. Deputy Treasurer Eric Munson and Chief of Staff Wil Cheatham will handle daily operations and attend meetings on Lowerys behalf until he returns, according to the treasurers office. “Treasurer Lowery and his family appreciate everyones thoughts and prayers,” the release said. Lowery was sworn in as state treasurer Jan. 10. He served in the state House of Representatives from 2013 until this year. Prior to serving in the Arkansas House, Lowery had been a newspaper editor, and taught communications at the University of Central Arkansas and Henderson State University, according to the treasurers website. Lowery also served as chief of staff for Lt. Gov. Mike Huckabee in the mid-1990s and was the lobbyist and executive director of the Arkansas chapter of the National Association of Insurance and Financial Advisors from 2003 to 2011.

        A bill that aims to require pornography websites to verify Arkansas users are at least 18 years old passed the House on Tuesday. Senate Bill 66, by Sen. Tyler Dees, R-Siloam Springs, received a vote in the House of 77-4 with 14 members voting present. The measure returns to the Senate for concurrence on amendments. House sponsor Rep. Mindy McAlindon, R-Centerton, said the bill is needed to protect children from pornography. While she said parents should monitor their children's online activity, she contended lawmakers were responsible for setting guardrails to limit minors' exposure to pornography. The bill would require commercial entities to use a reasonable age verification method before allowing users to access a website where more than a third of the material is deemed "harmful to minors." Verification methods allowed under the bill include digitized ID cards, a government-issued ID or any commercially-reasonable age verification method "that holds an Identity Assurance Level 2." Rep. Stephen Meeks, R-Greenbrier, said that while he appreciated the intent of the bill, he was concerned it could lead to identity theft. He also noted that if enacted the state law would not apply to businesses located outside of the state. McAlindon said other online services could leave users vulnerable to identity theft. She noted the bill would allow users to present a form of ID other than a driver's license. The bill contains a section that would bar commercial entities or third-party vendors from retaining any identifying information used to verify the age of the user. Under the bill, material that is harmful to minors is defined as any "material that the average person, applying contemporary community standards, would find, taking the material as a whole and with respect to minors, is designed to appeal to, or is designed to pander to, prurient interest." The legislation specifically points to "descriptions of actual, simulated, or animated displays or depictions of ... nipple of the female breast, pubic hair, anus, vulva, or genitals; touching, caressing, or fondling of nipples, breasts, buttocks, the anus, or genitals; or sexual intercourse, masturbation, sodomy, bestiality, oral copulation, flagellation, excretory functions, exhibitions of sexual act, or any other sexual act." The bill also would apply to material that as a whole lacks serious "literary, artistic, political, and scientific value for minors."  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        A prescribed burn in North Little Rocks Burns Park continued Tuesday at the RV Park and Campground off Arlene Laman Drive. Visitors to the park are prohibited from entering certain areas during the burn period. Residents and visitors of Central Arkansas may smell and see smoke coming from the park, said Shara Brazear, the citys director of communications, in a news release. The release also stated this particular day and time was selected for its wind direction and speed to help ensure the smoke will rise up and move away with minimal, temporary impact to the area. The burn consists of approximately 130 acres east and north of the RV Park and Campground, west of Championship Drive, south of I-40, and north of Arlene Laman Drive. Road closures has consisted of Arlene Laman between Tournament Drive and Championship Drive. Areas closed in Burns Park during the burn include Archery Range, BMX Track, Little Log Cabin, and Covered Bridge. The city sent out an announcement stating that staff and firefighters will monitor residual smoke and embers visible throughout the day and evening. This burn will help reduce fire fuel and improve wildlife habitat. Officials from the North Little Rock Parks and Recreation Department will be on-hand within Burns Park to answer questions from the public and to help direct traffic around the burn area.

        The Arkansas House of Representatives approved a bill that would create a monument to “unborn children aborted during the era of Roe v. Wade” on State Capitol grounds. Senate Bill 307 would create a private fund to cover the cost for the monument. The Capitol Arts and Grounds Commission will oversee the design of the monument, with the Secretary of State having final say over the monuments design and placement.” The bills sponsor, Rep. Mary Bentley, R-Perryville, likened the monument to memorials on the Capitol grounds commemorating the Little Rock Nine, firefighters and World War II veterans. The House voted 60-19 to approve the bill. “Every single year after Roe was set in 1973, weve had a March for Life here because we did not forget,” Bentley said. Some anti-abortion members spoke up against the bill, saying they did not feel a memorial would represent Christian values as they see it. Rep. Steve Unger, R-Springdale, said a monument would look like “spiking the football” after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June, clearing the way for Arkansas abortion ban to take effect which outlaws the procedure except in a case of medical emergency to save the mothers life. “Public memorials to our nations wars where we faced an external threat are right and proper,” Unger said. “A memorial to an ongoing culture war where we seem to be shooting at each other is not.”  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        Union County high school students can be licensed practical nurses within weeks of graduation thanks to a new pilot program at South Arkansas Community College -- the first of its kind in the state. A grant from the Arkansas Office of Skills Development (OSD) has funded launch of the program, which allows high school students to begin taking college nursing prerequisites as juniors, move into program-level college nursing course work as seniors and complete the program the summer following graduation. They can take the state licensing examination upon completion, meaning that the path is set for them to be able to begin work as practical nurses as young as age 18. "We're in a new era," instructor Michelle Moseley, who directs the SouthArk program, said. "If they know that this is what they want to do, why not go ahead and do this while in high school? I would have, had it been an option for me." For the state's part, the OSD -- which is working with other institutions to bring this program to life in other parts of Arkansas -- indicates that this effort is underway in order to combat nursing shortages seen throughout the U.S. As the high-school students will be taking the exact same classes as the post-graduate college nursing students -- and right alongside them -- it is important to note, Moseley said, that those who pursue this route must be academically and emotionally capable of handling the work load. "They have to be dedicated to their studies," she said. "They're going to have to work very hard and be self-disciplined." The program is prepared to accept up to 24 students in the prerequisite classes and up to 16 in the nursing classes, Moseley said. Current sophomores at all Union County public high school students are eligible pursue application and should speak with their guidance counselors for more information, Moseley said. "I hope that this continues to blossom and that it will produce hard-working, caring nurses," she said. Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        Six Arkansas Game and Fish Commission wildlife management areas will be temporarily closed for short periods in March in cooperation with the Arkansas Feral Hog Task Force to fight the spread of invasive feral swine in Arkansas. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service Wildlife Services will be conducting aerial operations aimed at reducing feral hog populations in the areas. The flights will be dependent on the weather. To provide safety for the public and comply with USDA regulations, access will not be allowed during the ongoing operations. Varying weather and site specific conditions limits the notice of specific dates of the closures. The closure dates do allow some flexibility to take advantage of resources over large contiguous tracts of habitat. Work began at the Beryl Anthony Lower Ouachita, Cut-off Creek and Seven Devils WMAs on Monday, and will continue through Friday, March 17. From March 20-24, eradication efforts will continue at the Trusten Holder and George H. Dunklin Jr. Bayou Meto WMAs. The operations will end at the University of Arkansas Pine Tree Wildlife Demonstration Area, where USDA officials will work March 27-30. In the event that access to the areas are restricted, AGFC and partnering agency staff will be on-site to maintain road and access closures, according to AGFC Director Austin Booth. "We hate to close these areas for these operations, but feral hogs threaten both wildlife and agriculture in Arkansas. They destroy habitat, prey on wildlife and can be linked to disease transmission," Booth said. The aerial operations are the result of planning and coordination of multiple partners, condensed into several days of actual operations. The AGFC and USDA APHIS would like to thank the public in advance for their patience and understanding while these activities are underway and apologize for any inconvenience related to the operation. For additional information, contact AGFC Feral Hog Coordinator, Ryan Farney at 501-382-3945 or Arkansas APHIS Director Robert Byrd at 501-835-2318. Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         MURFREESBORO – A regular visitor to Crater of Diamonds State Park recently discovered a 3.29-carat brown diamond in his wet-sifted gravel. It is the largest diamond found at the park this year and the largest since September 2021, according to an Arkansas State Parks news release. David Anderson of Murfreesboro spotted the gem on March 4, while wet-sifting soil from the West Drain of the park's 37.5-acre diamond search area. "At first I thought it was quartz but wondered why it was so shiny. Once I picked it up, I realized it was a diamond," Anderson said. Anderson first learned about Crater of Diamonds State Park while watching The Travel Channel in 2007. Anderson has found more than 400 diamonds over the past 16 years, including 15 weighing over one carat. His other top finds include a 3.83-carat yellow diamond found in December 2011 and a 6.19-carat white gem discovered in April 2014. Finders of Crater diamonds often choose to name their gems. Anderson named his diamond B.U.D. "That's for Big, Ugly Diamond," said Anderson, noting the diamond's pitted surface and mottled brown color. Anderson typically sells his diamonds locally and said he also plans to sell this one. Anderson's diamond is the largest gem park staff have registered since September 2021, when a visitor from Granite Bay, California, discovered a 4.38-carat yellow diamond at the site. Anderson's is the largest brown diamond from the park since the Kinard Friendship Diamond, a 9.07-carat gem found on Labor Day 2020. The Kinard Friendship Diamond was discovered by Kevin Kinard of Maumelle and is the second-largest diamond found at Crater of Diamonds State Park. As of this Tuesday, 124 diamonds had been registered at Crater of Diamonds State Park this year. An average of one to two diamonds are found by park visitors each day.    David Anderson of Murfreesboro, Arkansas, holds up the 3.29-carat diamond he found March 4, 2023, at Crater of Diamonds State Park in Murfreesboro. The diamond was the largest found in the park since September 2021. (Arkansas Parks Department)      Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         LITTLE ROCK — Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders has signed legislation making it easier to sue providers of gender-affirming care for children, a move that could effectively reinstate a blocked ban on such care. Sanders on Monday signed the new law, which won't take effect until this summer. It would allow anyone who received gender-affirming care as a minor to file a malpractice lawsuit against their doctor for up to 15 years after they turn 18. Under current Arkansas law, medical malpractice claims must be filed within two years of an injury. Legal experts have said the change could close access to gender-affirming care for children by making it nearly impossible for providers to get malpractice insurance. "Arkansas infamously passed the first law in the nation to try to ban gender affirming care for trans youth and after hearing extensive evidence, the courts have blocked that ban," Holly Dickson, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas, said in a statement. “This bill is an effort to achieve indirectly what the Constitution prohibits the state from doing directly.” The new law is among a growing number of bills targeting transgender people, who have faced increasingly hostile rhetoric at statehouses. At least 175 bills targeting trans people have been introduced in statehouses so far this year, the most in a single year, according to the Human Rights Campaign. The bill was signed as a federal judge is considering whether to strike down a 2021 Arkansas law that would prohibit doctors from providing gender-affirming hormone therapy or puberty blockers to anyone under 18 — or referring them to other doctors who can provide that care. No gender-affirming surgery is performed on minors in the state. Republican Sen. Gary Stubblefield, who sponsored the malpractice law, said he didn't know if the measure would face a similar court challenge. “Anything can create a court challenge in the world we live in today,” Stubblefield said. “I know we did what we thought was best for our children.” U.S. District Judge Jay Moody temporarily blocked the state's ban on gender-affirming care for minors in 2021. Arkansas was the first state to enact such a ban, and several states have approved similar restrictions. A ban in Alabama has also been blocked by a federal judge. Opponents of such treatments argue that minors are too young to make decisions about their futures. But every major medical group, including the American Medical Association, supports gender-affirming care for youths and has opposed the bans. The malpractice legislation includes a “safe harbor” provision that would give doctors a defense against malpractice lawsuits over providing gender-affirming care for children, but only if they follow restrictions that experts have said are inconsistent with the standard of care for the treatments. The new law won't take effect until 90 days after the Legislature adjourns this year's session, which isn't expected to happen until next month at the earliest. The bill is among several targeting transgender youth that have been proposed in Arkansas this year. Others include legislation that would criminalize transgender adults using the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity. The bill goes even further than a bathroom bill North Carolina repealed following widespread boycotts. Dickson urged Sanders to hear from trans youth and those who care from them before signing any more bills affecting the LGBTQ community.  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         A Pulaski County circuit court judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing Summit Utilities Inc. from disconnecting gas customers and collecting late fees while a lawsuit over billing issues is being considered. Summit, however, has filed a petition to move the case to federal court. Circuit Court Judge LaTonya Honorable issued the order late Monday, saying that the suit by Summit customers “demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits and a likelihood of immediate and irreparable harm that is not adequately compensable by money damages.” Click here to read the judge's order, or visit arkansasonline.com/315summit. Summit customers “may refuse and not make payments on their Summit monthly gas bills” while the restraining order is pending, she wrote. The suit seeks class-action status for all Summit customers in the state. The utility also filed its petition Monday afternoon saying it “denies the allegations in the complaint, denies that it is liable in any way, and denies that class treatment is appropriate.” The utility asked for the suit to be moved to U.S. District Court in Little Rock under the federal Class Action Fairness Act because the dispute involves more than $5 million in claims. Summit says its monthly revenue in Arkansas is more than $5 million. The federal petition was assigned to Judge Brian Miller in the Eastern District of Arkansas; he has not yet ruled on Summits motion. Summit, in a recent message to customers, said it voluntarily suspended all disconnects and stopped collecting late fees.

         A House committee advanced a bill Tuesday that would require written permission from parents before school employees could address students by their preferred pronoun or name. House 1468, which passed committee last week, was referred back to the House Education Committee after its sponsor, Rep. Wayne Long, said the bill needed to be amended. The committee passed the bill on a voice vote with Democrat representatives Denise Garner and Vivian Flowers dissenting. The bill requires school officials address students by their name listed on their birth certificate and the pronouns consistent with a students biological sex, unless given parental permission to do otherwise. Long said his amendment further clarifies school employees cannot be punished for not addressing a student by a preferred pronoun or name. The House Education Committee also voted to concur with a Senate amendment Tuesday to restrict transgender people from using the bathroom of their choice at a public school. The Senate approved the bill Monday on a party-line vote. The bill was amended in the Senate to clarify that students traveling on school-sponsored overnight trips must either share sleeping quarters with students of the same sex or be “provided single-occupancy sleeping quarters.”  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         The housing market in Northwest Arkansas cooled in the second half of 2022, with the number of home sales dropping when compared to the first half of the year, and sale prices flattened. According to the report sponsored by Arvest Bank, home sales in Benton, Washington and Madison counties dropped to 4,774 in the second half of 2022, from 6,030 when compared to the same period a year ago — a decline of 21%. Sales are down slightly when compared to the first half of the year, or nearly flat at 4,848. For the first time in several years. housing prices flattened out or even declined in one county when compared to the first half of the year. In Benton County, the average sale price for the last half of 2022 was $401,075, up 16% from $345,517 for the same period a year ago. But that was down 0.5% from $403,829 for the first half of 2021.  In Washington County, the average home price was $376,018, up 22% from $311,572 for the second half of 2021 and up 4% from $362,924 for the first half of 2022.  Madison Countys average sale price for the second half of 2022 was $248,773, up 15% when compared to $216,079 for the same period a year ago, and up 4% when compared to $238,463 for the first half of the year. “We have been saying for some time that home prices in Northwest Arkansas have needed to stabilize in order for the region to continue to be an attractive and affordable place to call home,” Mervin Jebaraj, director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at the Sam M. Walton College of Business at the University of Arkansas, said in a statement. "I believe that the leveling of price increases are an opportunity for the market to potentially recalibrate at a more sustainable pace.”  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has closed Arkansas 187 across Beaver Dam through April 5 in order to remove maintenance equipment that is used on the dam, according to a press release from the Arkansas Department of Transportation. The Dam Site Peninsula Park, also known as the Dam Site cutoff wall, will be closed as well until the work is complete, the release states. Traffic barricades and signage will assist drivers passing through the area, but they should plan for additional travel time and consider U.S. 62 as an alternate route, according to the release.

        The Arkansas Senate on Monday handily approved a bill that would restrict transgender people from using the bathroom of their choice at public schools. In a party-line vote, the Senate voted 29-6 to send House Bill 1156 by state Rep. Mary Bentley, R-Perryville, to the House to consider concurring with a Senate amendment to the bill. HB1156 would require public schools and open-enrollment public charter schools to prohibit people from using a multiple-occupancy restroom that does not correspond with the sex listed on their birth certificate. The bill also would apply to places at schools where people "may be in various stages of undress" around others, which would include locker rooms, changing rooms and shower rooms. Under the bill, students on overnight trips would have to either share sleeping quarters with one or multiple members of the same sex or be "provided single-occupancy sleeping quarters." A public school student attending an overnight trip may share sleeping quarters with a member of the opposite sex if the member of the opposite sex is a member of the public school student's immediate family. The bill has a requirement for schools to provide "a reasonable accommodation" for those unwilling to use a multi-occupancy restroom or changing areas designated for the individual's sex. Afterward, Gov. Sarah Sanders spokeswoman Alexa Henning said Sanders "believes that schools are no place for the radical left's woke agenda" and will sign legislation that focuses on protecting and educating kids, not indoctrinating them. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Jonesboro, who is the Senate sponsor of HB1156, told senators "there are boys and there are young girls who are afraid and do not want to spend the night or share a restroom with people of the other sex." "That's exactly what this is about," he said. Sen. Clarke Tucker, D-Little Rock, told senators "you might believe that this bill protects kids who are not trans in school, but it doesn't." "We've tried separate but equal in this country before and we know how that turned out," he said. "When are we going to stop castigating and marginalizing people just because they're different?" Tucker read to state senators parts of a 2020 U.S. appeals court ruling that a Virginia school board acted unlawfully in preventing a transgender student from using a bathroom at his high school that corresponded with his gender identity. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that a transgender student is protected under federal law that bars sex discrimination in education and the U.S. Constitution's requirement that people be treated equally under the law. But Sen. Matt McKee, R-Pearcy, said the bill is a simple solution for a simple problem. "We discriminate based on the body parts," he said, and the bill aims to protects young men and women. Last week, the Senate Education Committee endorsed HB1156 after the panel approved an amendment from Sullivan aimed at clarifying language that bars students from "sleeping quarters with a member of the opposite sex" during an overnight school-sponsored trip. The amendment, which was suggested by Sen. Jimmy Hickey Jr., R-Texarkana, states students must either share sleeping quarters with one or multiple members of the same sex or be "provided single-occupancy sleeping quarters." Bentley told the Senate committee the idea for the bill was brought to her by members of the Conway School Board, who passed a similar policy in October that caused a backlash among some within the community. Bentley said she wanted to create a state law that would shield school districts from lawsuits if they enacted a similar bathroom policy. Sarah Everett, policy director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas, told the Senate committee the bill would not withstand a legal challenge, as "multiple circuit courts of appeals" have said similar laws have violated federal sex discrimination statutes. Also on Monday, the Arkansas House of Representatives voted to re-refer to the House Education Committee a bill that would prohibit school staff from addressing students by their preferred pronoun or name at the request of the bill's sponsor. House Bill 1468, by Rep. Wayne Long, R-Bradford, would require written permission from parents before school employees could address students by a pronoun inconsistent with a student's biological sex or a name other than the one listed on their birth certificate. The bill would not apply to derivative names, such as "Bob" for "Robert," according to Long. Long asked the House of Representatives to send the bill back to committee, saying it needed to be amended. The House Education Committee endorsed the bill last week after Long said it's needed to protect teachers from being compelled to address students by a pronoun inconsistent with their biological sex. The bill would apply to public schools, open-enrollment charters and public colleges, and permission would only be required for a student who is "an unemancipated minor." "Since the bill passed out of committee, we'd run across a couple of things that we thought might need some clarification," Long said Monday.

        A Senate panel on Monday passed a bill intended to address a seven-year misinterpretation of state law by the Arkansas Department of Corrections that lawmakers said resulted in nearly 300 inmates convicted of residential burglary losing their eligibility for parole despite what they were told by attorneys and courts. The Committee on Judiciary advanced Senate Bill 366 by Sen. Joshua Bryant, R-Rogers, on a voice vote. The measure moves to the full Senate for further consideration. Bryant said his bill is needed to address an interpretation error that originated after a 2015 law designated residential burglary as a violent felony offense. The reclassification of residential burglary included in the Criminal Justice Reform Act of 2015 affected parole eligibility for certain offenders, since state law requires a person convicted of a violent felony offense who has previously been found guilty of a violent felony to serve 100% of their sentence. During the seven-year period covered by his bill, Bryant said the state Department of Corrections did not consider residential burglaries committed before the 2015 act to be violent felony offenses. Courts and attorneys used this guidance when negotiating plea arraignments and calculating sentences. In May, then-Attorney General Leslie Rutledge said in an opinion requested by the state Department of Corrections that any person convicted of residential burglary who commits an additional violent felony on or after April 1, 2015, should not be eligible for parole. Officials with the Department of Corrections told lawmakers in October the policy change led to 290 inmates' losing their parole eligibility and resulted in the re-incarceration of two people with prior convictions for residential burglary. Bryant told the committee that one of his constituents was among the two offenders who were re-incarcerated. To address the misinterpretation, SB366 would remove the violent felony classification for residential burglary offenses committed before April 1, 2015. The bill applies to defendants sentenced before May 24, 2022, unless the sentencing order expressly designates the defendant was sentenced under state law classifying residential burglary as a violent offense. The state Department of Corrections has not taken and does not intend to take a position on a bill, agency spokeswoman Dina Tyler said in an emailed statement Monday. "That's legislature's purview, not ours," Tyler said. "Of course, if this bill passes, we most certainly will follow the law and any rules that might be associated with it." In a written statement provided by a spokesman, Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin said he had "nothing to add at this time" due to pending litigation. Jeff Rosenzweig, who presented the bill alongside Bryant, said he was among defense attorneys representing defendants in a lawsuit pending in federal court over the misinterpretation. Max Hatfield, a special education teacher, spoke for the bill and said his stepson lost his eligibility for parole because of the misinterpretation. "Up until last year we were assuming that he would be out ... in July of 2023," he said. "Since all this has come to light and the attorney general released her opinion, he will now be released in June of 2042. That's not what he was told." Hatfield said he didn't wish to deny or absolve his stepson's actions but objected to the state's change in policy. "Our stepson was given a choice: He could go to trial with extra charges and risk a longer sentence, or take a deal which included the possibility of parole if he kept his actions clean," Hatfield said. "He chose a deal based on what our system told him." Hatfield pointed to 101 offenders who were released on parole but were convicted of residential burglary before 2015 and at least one other violent felony offense. In October state officials said 90 of these offenders were still under supervision and 11 had returned to Department of Corrections custody because they violated terms of parole. At the time, Solomon Graves, then-secretary of the department, said parolees' "inherent liberty" prevented the department from re-incarcerating them unless the parolees made an additional mistake. Rosenzweig said the bill would not erase any convictions or mandate an offender's release. "It merely reinstates the thought-through stated policy recorded in writing over and over again by the Department of Corrections," Rosenzweig said. Bryant said he was not looking for "empathy or sympathy" for offenders but said his bill was needed "for the state to honor its word." "Once someone from a high level tells you something, you take it to the bank," he said. While Bryant told the committee he didn't fault the state Department of Corrections since they were trying follow state law, he said lawmakers "have the ability to make this right." Sen. Terry Rice, R-Waldron, said he was empathetic in this case. "The one that does make me empathetic in this are the families that are trying to help," he said. "Hopefully they can do that if this goes through and they can get parole. I'm for rehabilitation." While Bob McMahan, prosecutor coordinator, said prosecutors are "very sympathetic to certain situations," he spoke against the bill, saying it is a "blanket solution." The bill, he said, would apply to offenders who took pleas or went to trial while understanding they would not be eligible for parole. In cases where an offender may have made a misguided plea arrangement, McMahan said he felt there was an opportunity to "go to the governor's office." He noted that prosecutors might be willing in some instances to write letters on behalf of offenders who were misinformed. Sen. Ben Gilmore, R-Crossett, noted that a residential burglary charge could apply to crimes involving various degrees of violence. "Do you know what type of residential burglary they committed?" he asked. "Was it stealing a lawn mower off the carport? Was it breaking into someone's home with a handgun while they're present?" Rosenzweig said there is "a mix of both" but noted he had not combed through all the cases the bill would affect. A victim of a residential burglary crime could protest a defendant's parole by sending a letter or appearing before the Arkansas Parole Board, Rosenzweig said.

        FAYETTEVILLE -- Issues with drainage and questions about potential street connectivity prompted the Planning Commission to hold a development plan for a mixed-use project at the former site of the 112 Drive-In. Commissioners voted 9-0 Monday to hold until March 27 the development plan for the Aronson, the planned future home of Alamo Drafthouse Cinema + Drive-In. The plan also shows two other commercial buildings and 214 residential units on a portion of a 31-acre piece of land southeast of Van Asche Drive and Arkansas 112. Residences include three apartment buildings, a mix of single-family and multifamily units and a management building. Alamo Drafthouse plans to open next year, according to a news release. It is a cinema-eatery chain based in Austin, Texas, that would have its first permanent drive-in theater in Fayetteville. Little Rock developer and cinema enthusiast Dave Anderson and his partners bought the property for $5.5 million in August, according to Washington County property records. The 112 Drive-In operated for 42 years before featuring its final showings with "Grease" and "Footloose" last summer. Engineering Services Inc., in Springdale, presented the proposal to the commission and asked for four variances to code, three of which had to do with the size and number of parking spaces. Staff supported the requests so that the 45 stalls in front of the drive-in screen could have adequate room for servers to go to and from cars. City code allows 243 parking spaces for the theater, and the proposal asked for 256 including the drive-in stalls. City code also encourages traffic access between adjacent developed properties. The northern portion of the site would be residential and use private drives and therefore not required to provide street connectivity to adjacent property. However, streams run south and east of the commercial portion of the development, and street connections on either side would not be feasible, according to staff. Staff supported not requiring street connectivity to nearby properties, but planning commissioners expressed a desire to get some sort of street connection. The Arkansas Department of Transportation is planning to install a roundabout at Arkansas 112 west of the site. Commissioner Andrew Brink said without a street connection to the east, the roundabout effectively will dead-end within the development. Commissioner Jimm Garlock said having no street connections would landlock the forested property to the east, which is owned by David Nelms. Most of the discussion focused on discrepancies in the plan the city's engineers identified relating to drainage. The property lies within a large drainage basin, about 544 acres, said Josh Boccaccio, engineering development review manager. Most of the property lies within a floodplain. The city's rules on development within floodplains say there can be no adverse impact to surrounding properties, he said. Boccaccio said the pond as proposed in the plan appeared too small to handle the amount of water if Clabber Creek were to overflow, and that staff had other outstanding questions about the plan's drainage calculations. "I'm not doing the design, so I can't speak specifically, but in conversations between staff we're not certain the overflow here as designed is going to function correctly," he said. Preston Locher with Engineering Services Inc. said the company will work with city staff and clarify the information in time for the commission's next meeting. Brink said flooding is an issue that needs to be considered reasonably. "In this scenario, it seems like there's a lot to consider, especially with how large that drainage basin is," he said. "I'm glad the applicant and staff are working together."  Commission action Fayetteville's Planning Commission met Monday and considered nine requests for short-term rentals, approving all but one. The one the commission rejected by a 9-0 vote was at a townhome on Fletcher Avenue northeast of Dickson Street. Commissioners previously rejected short-term rental requests for two other units in the same development, both of which are in the process of being appealed to the City Council. The commission cited compatibility issues in its decision. Source: Fayetteville     Print Headline: 112 Drive-In plan held to fix issues Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         LITTLE ROCK -- A bill to place more regulations on Arkansas counties that choose hand-count ballots instead of using vote-tabulation machines passed a House committee Monday. Senate Bill 250, sponsored by Sen. Kim Hammer, R-Benton, would require counties that opt out of using voting machines to have their paper ballots be "compatible with the electronic vote-tabulation devices." Counties that also forgo using machines to count votes would be entirely responsible for the costs associated with the printing and counting of paper ballots. "We want to make sure that all 75 counties are held accountable," Hammer said, "and if you choose to deviate from what is a statewide accepted practice, protected in law, then why should the other counties have to bear the burden of paying the additional costs that you have chosen?" The committee passed the bill on a voice vote, sending it to the House for further action. The bill has drawn criticism from those worried about voting machines, with 14 members of the public testifying against the bill at Monday's House Committee on State Agencies. "As Republicans, we believe in keeping government as close to the people as possible," said Scott Gray of the Saline County Republican Committee. "No matter how you slice it, SB250 as written effectively removes all existing power from the counties and puts it into the hands of bureaucrats." The bill also stipulates that counties that opt to count votes by hand first mark ballots with permanent ink and run them through a vote-tabulation machine. The push for the hand-counting of ballots is led by retired U.S. Army Col. Conrad Reynolds, head of the Arkansas Voter Integrity Initiative. Reynolds, who ran unsuccessfully against U.S. Rep. French Hill in June's Republican primary, told lawmakers on the committee that "we must get rid of the machines here in Arkansas." "We can continue to have the machines for convenience if we want that, but it's convenience over what I call transparency, accuracy and accountability," Reynolds said. In December, Reynolds filed a lawsuit against Secretary of State John Thurston, the State Board of Election Commissioners and Election Systems and Software to prevent the state from using certain kinds of voting machines. The Cleburne County Quorum Court voted last week to repeal a resolution from January requiring elections to be counted by hand. Reynolds had lobbied the Quorum Court to pass the resolution to switch to hand-counting. "From communications with them, it was done kind of hastily," Lindsey French, legal counsel with the Arkansas Association of Counties, said after speaking to members of the Cleburne County Quorum Court. "And after it was done they realized that maybe they were not fully aware of what they were doing." Rep. Cindy Crawford, R-Fort Smith, said she signed on to the bill as a co-sponsor before reading it but had second thoughts after strong reactions from her constituents. "I originally signed on to all of the election integrity bills, but I did not get a chance to read them," Crawford said. "And when this one came out my constituents went berserk, and they are still going berserk." Rep. Mary Bentley, R-Perryville, said paper ballots were more open to human error. "The only time that we had any errors, it was human error and it was on paper," Bentley said.

         BENTONVILLE -- A Rogers man was sentenced to 35 years in prison in connection with a shooting. Steven Jordan, 31, pleaded guilty Monday to battery, possession of firearms by certain persons and intimidating a witness. He was charged as a habitual offender. The plea was under an agreement Scott Parks, Jordan's attorney, reached with Thomas Gean, deputy prosecutor. Jordan was arrested in connection with the shooting of Cody Lupica at 803 E. Greenfield St. in Rogers on Feb. 3, 2021. David Atchison called police that day and said he'd been hit on the head with a pistol and his friend, Lupica, had been shot and left the scene in a car, according to a probable cause affidavit. Atchison explained he was with Lupica when Lupica was talking to someone on the phone. That person threatened to kill Lupica and his family, according to the affidavit. The two arrived at Lupica's home, and Atchison told police two people approached the car, the affidavit states. Atchison said both people had a gun, and he took off running. One of the individuals chased him down and hit him on the face with the gun, according to the affidavit. Atchison said he heard two gunshots, according to the affidavit. The intimidation charge involved Jordan threatening Atchison to influence his testimony, according to court documents. Benton County Circuit Judge Robin Green accepted the plea agreement and Jordan's guilty plea. Jordan was ordered not to have any contact with Atchison, Lupica and their family members. Erick Avelar-Mejia, 19, of Rogers was also arrested in connection with the incident. His case hasn't been resolved. He's charged with attempted capital murder and two counts of battery.

        BENTONVILLE -- A Denver man was arrested Monday and accused of threatening to kill Benton County Circuit Judge Brad Karren and a probation officer. Theodore Howell, 29, was arrested on charges of threatening a judicial officer and terroristic threatening. Benton County Circuit Judge Robin Green presided over Monday's bond hearing for Howell. Green found probable cause to hold Howell on the felony charges. She ordered Howell to be held without bond in a probation revocation case and $500,000 cash only in the latest arrest. Nathan Jeffrey, a probation officer, reported to the Benton County sheriff's office he received a text message threatening to kill him from Howell, according to a probable cause affidavit. Jeffrey said he knew the phone belonged to Howell because it was the same phone number Howell had down for being on probation and Jeffrey had communicated with Howell in the past using that number, according to the affidavit. The sheriff's office has a website where there's a contact form request option which can be submitted by anyone, according to the affidavit. There were three contact request forms that had threats directed at Karren and one form with threats directed at Jeffrey, according to court documents. The threats made in the requests were connected to Howell, according to the affidavit. Howell said in the first form he planned to kill Karren when he's walking to court and Karren would never expect it, according to the affidavit. Howell said he planned to kill Jeffrey at the probation office, the affidavit says. Howell described Karren as transphobic in the second request form, according to court documents. Howell said he planned to kill Karren with a knife while he was walking to court, according to the affidavit. "I've been arrested for threats before so this time I will act on it," a message on the form states. Howell said he planned to kill Karren because Arkansas was mean to trans people and the jail was "super" mean to him the last time he was held there, according to the affidavit. "I will literally hit him with a hammer [then] run away and no will expect me because y'all are too stupid to find me," the affidavit quotes Howell as saying. Michael Braswell, a detective with the sheriff's office, interviewed Howell, who first claimed he had been hacked and someone else made the threats, according to the affidavit. Howell later admitted texting Jeffrey and making the threats to Karren, the affidavit says. It says Howell said he was never going to follow through with the threats and didn't know why he did it. He was arrested in November 2021 after attempting to enter secured areas of the Bentonville Police Department. He was dressed as a woman and armed with a knife, according to court documents. He pleaded guilty in November and was placed on six years of state-supervised probation. He was also ordered to seek mental health treatment. Prosecutors filed a motion Friday to revoke Howell's bond. He turned himself in, and he was booked at 11:28 p.m. Friday into the Benton County jail. Howell told the judge at Monday's hearing he's unemployed and had been living in Colorado. Green appointed the Benton County public defender's office to represent Howell. Howell's arraignment is scheduled for 8 a.m. April 17. Threats of violence against Karren have been reported in the past and in at least one case led to a conviction. In December 2019, a Springdale woman was sentenced to 40 years in prison for trying to hire a man to kill Karren and another man. Dorris Jenkins, then 38 years old, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit capital murder.

        State Rep. Mary Bentley, R-Perryville, filed a bill Monday that would add three words to the Arkansas Freedom of Information Act: "of a quorum." Bentley said those words are needed to define what constitutes a "public meeting." Otherwise, a public meeting could be construed as two board members talking about the public's business. "I don't think this weakens FOIA at all," Bentley said in response to a reporter's question. "I think it strengthens it because of the ambiguity that's in that definition." Bentley said the ambiguous definition of public meetings in the Arkansas law has hampered quorum courts, city councils and school boards in her House District 54, which includes all of Perry County and parts of Faulkner, Saline and Yell counties. Bentley said members of those boards should be able to talk in small groups among themselves, as legislators can do, before holding public meetings to discuss and vote on issues before the public. Bentley said she researched the six states that border Arkansas, and all of them define a public meeting as one consisting of either a quorum or a majority of the board members. "I'm just mirroring what they're doing," she said. Bentley said she doesn't see that bordering states are having more corruption because their definition of a public meeting requires a quorum or majority. Bentley's House Bill 1610 would add "of a quorum" to this part of Arkansas Code § 25-19-106 concerning open public meetings: "(a) Except as otherwise specifically provided by law, all meetings, formal or informal, special or regular, [of a quorum] of the governing bodies of all municipalities, counties, townships, and school districts and all boards, bureaus, commissions, or organizations of the State of Arkansas, except grand juries, supported wholly or in part by public funds or expending public funds, shall be public meetings." Robert Steinbuch, a professor of law at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, said the change won't shed more light on things for the public. "Mary's a good friend, but I think this bill is a mistake," Steinbuch said. "The people have a right to see the operation of their government. That's what the open meetings act requires and that's what good government requires. This bill, unfortunately even with good motives, goes in the wrong direction. "I'm thankful for Mary's efforts. She's a great legislator. She's a good friend, but we disagree on this bill." On March 7, state Sen. Alan Clark, R-Lonsdale, filed Senate Bill 382, which would amend Arkansas Code § 25-19-103 to define a meeting as "the convening of two (2) or more members of a governing body of a public entity for which a quorum is required to make a decision, discuss public business, or deliberate toward a decision on any matter." In Clark's bill, a meeting doesn't include "the on-site inspection of a project or program" or "a chance interaction of two (2) or more members of a governing body of a public entity." "Sen. Clark's bill goes in the other direction, and I think that's a better bill," Steinbuch said. "That bill says 'Look, if you're a member of a governing body, you should restrict your conversations of items that are under consideration to the open meeting,' and I think that's entirely doable. I think that's the better way to go." The board members can still go out to dinner together, but they should refrain from discussing board business until they get to the public meeting, Steinbuch said. Bentley said she's been working on the bill for a month and didn't know Clark was working on his bill regarding public meetings. Bentley said the current law prohibits justices of the peace and school board members from doing as good a job as they could. She said very few people attend quorum court and school board meetings. "I think we'll have more engagement with the public because the school board members and the quorum court members have been not engaging with the public like they should've because they're afraid that they're going to be sued for breaking the FOIA law because it was just so ambiguous," she said. "So I think we'll have more engagement with the public and within members of the quorum court, school board and city council." Under her bill, they still can't "conduct business" or "vote on anything" without a quorum present, she said. [DOCUMENT: Read Copy of HB 1610 » arkansasonline.com/314hb1610/]  But, under her bill, Bentley said justices of the peace could ride in the same vehicle to a conference somewhere and brainstorm about ways to improve county government along the way there and the way back. Now, they're afraid to even talk, she said. "They don't want people to think something is going on nefariously," Bentley said'. "I think it's unfair that we have restrained them in the way that we have," she said. Bentley's bill has 22 co-sponsors in the House and one so far in the Senate. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on State Agencies & Governmental Affairs. Clark's bill was referred to a similar committee in the Senate.

        The Arkansas Senate on Monday approved a bill that would require the state treasurer and state and local government entities to divest certain investments with financial services providers on a list maintained by the state treasurer due to the use of environmental, social justice or governance-related metrics. The Senate voted 23-9 to send House Bill 1307 by Rep. Jeff Wardlaw, R-Hermitage, back to the House of Representatives to consider two Senate amendments. Three senators voted present on the bill. Sen. Ricky Hill, R-Cabot, the Senate sponsor of the bill, said the bill is aimed at making sure the state doesn't invest funds with financial service providers that discriminate against the energy, fossil fuel, ammunition and firearms industries. He said he doesn't see how the state's retirement systems could project losses as a result of the bill when the state treasurer doesn't have a list yet of the financial service providers that the state treasurer and state and local government entities must divest investments from due to their use of environmental, social justice or governance-related, or ESG, metrics. Sen. Clarke Tucker, D-Little Rock, said the bill will clearly cost the state money. Officials of the state's retirement systems have estimated the bill could potentially cost them millions of dollars. Wardlaw has maintained the bill has been amended to minimize its impact on these retirement systems. HB1307 would create an ESG oversight committee to determine a list of financial service providers that discriminate against energy, fossil fuel, firearms or ammunition companies or otherwise refuse to deal based on environmental, social justice and other governance-related factors. Under the bill, the committee would comprise four citizens of the state -- with the governor, attorney general, House speaker and Senate president pro tempore each appointing one citizen -- and the state treasurer or his designee. The state treasurer would be required to maintain a list of financial service providers as determined by the ESG oversight committee on the state treasurer's website under the bill. In determining whether to name a financial services provider on the list, the state treasurer, under the direction of the attorney general, would be required to consider and may rely upon specified information under the bill. The state treasurer also would be required under the bill to divest the state of all direct or indirect holdings with a financial services provider included on the list published on the state treasurer's website, and state and local governments would be required to divest themselves of all direct or indirect holdings with a financial services provider included on the list published on the state treasurer's website. If an investment is subject to divestment under the bill, but is locked into a maturity date and an early divestment would result in a financial penalty to the state and cause a negative financial impact to the state, then the investment is exempt from divestiture under the bill in order to prevent financial harm to the state and ensure that the fiduciary duty for the state treasurer is met. Wardlaw told a state Senate committee last week the bill includes a provision that states that "discriminating against energy companies" does not include actions by the investment adviser in accordance with the investment-related guidelines, policies or preference of its clients, so that's why he believes the impact of the bill will be minimal on state government's retirement systems. The bill also exempts "indirect holdings." Arkansas Teacher Retirement System Executive Director Clint Rhoden testified last week that the system's investment consultant, Aon Hewitt Investment Consulting, has estimated the system could lose $7 million a year as a result of the bill. The system has $7 billion in direct investments in a total investment portfolio totaling about $20.3 billion, he said. Rhoden asked the Senate State Agencies and Governmental Affairs Committee last week to amend the bill to completely exempt state government retirement systems to mirror West Virginia's bill and deal with ESG investing issues in a separate bill. Wardlaw said he already has amended the bill in good faith to minimize the impact of the bill on state government retirement systems. Officials at the Arkansas Public Employees Retirement System have estimated the system could have a potential loss of $30 million to $40 million per year under the bill. The system's investments are valued at about $10.5 billion. "At present, we have no exact determination of what entities will be excluded from investments, so it is a very difficult calculation," system Executive Director Amy Fecher said last week in a written statement. Robyn Smith, executive secretary of the Arkansas State Highway Employees Retirement System, said in an email dated Feb. 22 to Sen. Jimmy Hickey, R-Texarkana, that in "consultation with the other State Systems and review of what has resulted in other states, our conservative estimate of losses could range anywhere from 10 basis points or $20.1 million over 15 years to 70 basis points, which would be about $140.6 million over 15 years." Smith said last week the highway employees retirement system's investments are valued at about $1.5 billion. David Clark, executive director of the Local Police and Fire Retirement System, said in an email dated Feb. 22 to Hickey that "a conservative estimate for LOPFI is a potential cost of $1 million/a year." Clark said last week the system's investments are valued at about $2.5 billion.  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        LITTLE ROCK -- A House committee advanced a pair of bills to enhance cybersecurity for state and local government agencies. House Bill 1555 comes in response to ransomware attacks across the state, and it would allow lawmakers to go into closed session to discuss a breach. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Stephen Meeks, R-Greenbrier, is aimed at "not letting the bad guys know what we're doing." The committee passed the bills unanimously through a voice vote, sending them to the House floor for further consideration. The bill states that the joint House and Senate Committee on Advanced Communications and Information Technology can meet in private "to review a cybersecurity incident involving, or a cyberattack on, a public entity." The bill also exempts the committee's private sessions from Freedom of Information Act requests. A computer technician and chair of the House panel, Meeks said the joint committee needed to be able to meet in private to prevent "bad guys" from knowing where government agencies may be vulnerable to further attacks. "What we want to be able to do is allow this committee to meet in private to hear the details of those attacks so that we have proper government oversight," Meeks said. Recently, numerous public bodies and agencies have been hit by cyber attacks. In December, the Little Rock School Board signed off on paying a $250,000 ransom to hackers who broke into its internal data networks. The School District also has sought an attorney general's opinion on whether it can meet in private to discuss cyber attacks. The House Committee on Advanced Communications and Information Technology also approved House Bill 1369, sponsored by Meeks. The bill requires government agencies to submit a cybersecurity policy to the state. Meeks said the bill would set a minimum standard for cybersecurity. "Our hope is to create a cyber standard that will be used across the state," Meeks said. "And instead of everybody kind of doing their own things, we want to make sure we have one cohesive minimum standard that's being used across the state." The bill also would require government entities to set a greater technology use policy to prevent government employees from expressing a personal political opinion to an elected official while on duty.

         The Vincent Parks Act was signed into law Monday by Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, with Parks' widow at her side. The law requires instructors at the state's police academy to be trained on how to prevent and respond to illnesses cadets could face during physical activity. "Protecting and supporting our heroic police officers should start long before they are ever on the streets," Sanders said in a news release. "This bill will help us do that in close consultation with the law enforcement leaders who run our state's training programs." Parks, 38, died after training for about 25 minutes in extreme heat, an Arkansas State Police investigative file revealed. State officials initially released a statement saying Parks had not participated in physical activity before his death. It took nearly a month after multiple questionings from media and legislators to correct the statement. "It means everything to me that we have this safeguard in place for future officers and that we can let his legacy live on," Parks' wife, Christina, said Monday. "We want to do everything we can to protect the people who are training to protect us." Rep. Francis Cavenaugh, R-Walnut Ridge, sponsored House Bill 1458, which soared through the House and Senate unanimously. She also was one of the first public officials to question Arkansas Department of Public Safety officials about Parks' death. Parks died on the first day of training at the Arkansas Law Enforcement Training Academy on July 17. He already was a commissioned officer with the Jonesboro Police Department when he left his family for the 13-week basic training course. Training started at about 1 p.m. at Camp Robinson in North Little Rock on a day that the National Weather Service had issued heat-related advisories. The weather service recorded a heat index of about 106 degrees in the area at about the time Parks and other cadets started physical activity in the khaki pants, polo shirts and work boots they were required to wear. Parks fell ill about 1:25 p.m. and was escorted to a picnic table where he was provided oxygen, statements in the investigative file say. By 3 p.m. he was pronounced dead at Baptist Health Medical Center-North Little Rock, the file states. A news release sent hours after Parks' death said that he was not participating in physical activity prior to falling ill. The release was sent by Bill Sadler, then-Arkansas State Police spokesman, at the request of former Arkansas Department of Public Safety Secretary Jami Cook. Cook resigned due to health concerns soon after Parks' death. The state police announced a review of Parks' death was changed to a criminal investigation in August after finding facts "contrary" to original statements. Pulaski County Prosecuting Attorney Larry Jegley decided in December that no criminal charges would be filed. He cited the medical examiner's report that ruled the cause of death an accident from three health conditions: sickle cell disease triggered by physical exertion and heat stress, hypertensive heart disease and obesity. In a letter written to state police Col. Bill Bryant on Dec. 15 and released the next day, Jegley outlined his reasons for not pursuing charges. "However, the file did contain concerning issues with the culture of the training program at ALETA," Jegley wrote,"including hazing and the lack of helpful cooperation in the investigation. We will not reiterate those concerns here but would invite a careful inquiry into the practice, procedures and other problems at ALETA made obvious in the ASP report." The investigative summary mentions some recruits claiming the training was "hazing" or a "smoke session" event because of the nature of activity being conducted in extreme heat. All 28 recruits agreed that it was too hot of a day to be conducting physical training in the clothes they were instructed to wear, the summary says. Some of the recruits said they were unfairly treated and not allowed to have water breaks or use the restroom, the report says. Parks' attorney, Jim Jackson, has filed a complaint with the Arkansas Claims Commission seeking monetary damages against the Department of Public Safety and training academy employee Joe Duboise. The complaint calls the activity on July 17 at the training academy "hazing" and initial statements that Parks did not participate in training a "cover-up." "This narrative was a bald-faced lie put forth by Central ALETA [Arkansas Law Enforcement Training Academy]," the claim states. "Central ALETA's instructors knew they had no excuse for making the new officers perform physical activities in the sun on the afternoon of July 17, 2022." Christina Parks said Monday she is "glad there is some good coming out of this tragedy." "I want to thank all the legislators who worked on this," Parks said. "We could have swept it under the table." Jonesboro Police Chief Rick Elliott questioned the training academy's actions within the weeks after Parks' death. "I'm glad we got the bill signed, and we can move forward and better protect our future officers attending the state's academy," Elliott said Monday. "My thanks go out to our sponsoring legislators and the whole legislative body for passing it."

         FAYETTEVILLE -- The University of Arkansas has named a new vice chancellor for university advancement. Scott Varady is set to take on the role effective April 17. He is a University of Arkansas alumnus and currently the director of the Razorback Foundation. "During some challenging times, Scott provided transformative leadership in building an outstanding team of fundraising professionals who helped the Razorback Foundation become a full-menu, fundraising organization; successfully cultivated hundreds of friends and volunteers; and raised millions of dollars in private gift support benefiting Razorback student-athletes, athletics programs and facilities," said Chancellor Charles Robinson in a news release. During Varady's tenure at the Razorback Foundation, the organization raised more than $71 million for the expansion and renovation of Donald W. Reynolds Razorback Stadium, the Frank O'Mara Track and Field Performance Center and the J.B. and Johnelle Hunt Family Baseball Development Center. Varady will replace outgoing Vice Chancellor Mark Power, who will remain with the university as a senior adviser.

         ROGERS -- A foot believed to be human was found near the area of Hickory Creek at Beaver Lake, according to a news release Monday from the Benton County Sheriff's Office. Someone brought the foot to Rogers Fire Station No. 7 at 3400 S. First St. on Sunday after their dog found it, according to the release and Keith Foster, a spokesman for the Rogers Police Department. The foot was then handed over to the Sheriff's Office, Foster said. Search and rescue teams are searching the area where the foot is believed to have been located while Sheriff's Office detectives investigate, according to the release. There was no further information available Monday, the release states.  Print Headline: Sheriffs Office investigating after foot found Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         FAYETTEVILLE -- Police have identified the man who died in a March 3 house fire as Matthew Alicea. Sgt. Anthony Murphy, public information officer for the Fayetteville Police Department, identified Alicea, 31, as the man found dead in the house at 2250 N. Hummingbird Lane. Fayetteville firefighters were called to the residence at 5:12 a.m. March 3. Several people were in the front yard and told firefighters someone was still inside, according to Capt. Andrew Horton, assistant fire marshal. Firefighters found one man inside the residence, apparently dead from injuries suffered in the fire. Three others -- two men and a woman -- were taken to area hospitals, and two of those were later transported to a burn unit in Springfield, Mo. Horton said Monday the cause of the fire was still under investigation.  Print Headline: Police identify man found dead in house fire Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         BENTONVILLE -- The Northwest Arkansas Community College Board of Trustees on Monday approved a fee of $4 per credit hour to fund athletics and student activities. The 5-3 vote followed a spirited discussion about the role sports should play at the college. Talks centered on whether there should be a part- or full-time athletic director, how to balance funding between student fees and the community and how much the college should expand its athletic program. Concerns were voiced about adding more expenses for students. Another key topic was how sports teams might boost the college's brand, perhaps giving students a sense of pride and a rallying point. Then there's the issue of area athletes who go elsewhere after high school because the college doesn't offer opportunities in their particular sports. Those matters weren't settled. But the fee made it through. Trustees Todd Schwartz, Lori Frank, Ron Branscum, Jonathan Woods and Amber Latimer voted for it. Rachel Harris, Joe Spivey and Carolyn Reeves voted against it. The $4 per credit hour fee would amount to $472,688 over five years on average, said Justin White, vice president of student services. The fee will take effect July 1, the start of fiscal year 2024. "The money will fund our current athletic program as it is now and then give a substantial amount of money to student life on campus," White said. "It's going to be great for our students. It's good for the community." The college has one National Junior College Athletic Association-approved sport -- cross country -- and fields men's and women's teams in that sport. "I want sports," said Spivey, who voted against the fee. "But I think we need to ease into this. I'm a big advocate for doing what's right for the students of Rogers and Bentonville." The board voted in 2019 to begin a cross country program, making it the college's first sanctioned athletic program. The cross country team competed for the first time in the fall of 2021. In their second season this past fall, the men finished fifth in the NJCAA Division II cross country national championship meet. The women's team placed 18th. The college's Athletics Committee voted unanimously last month to recommend hiring an athletic director for the 2023-24 school year. Grant Hodges, executive director of community and government relations and marketing, said earlier this month if a sustainable model of funding is approved, the goal would be to hire an athletic director after July 1. Many two-year institutions in the state have athletic programs and athletic directors; the biggest challenges are finding a dependable source of money and hiring the staff to build a high-quality athletic program, Hodges said. Northwest Arkansas Community College students pay a number of fees, several of which were increased last year. The college is the largest two-year college in the state, with 7,593 students taking courses for academic credit last fall semester.

        Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin announced Monday the creation of the Election Integrity Unit within his office, which is intended to track potential violations of election laws. The unit will operate under the attorney general office's Special Investigations Division with Wayne Bewley, chief of investigations, serving as its director. The unit will operate using existing staff and will require no additional resources, according to a news release. "Public confidence in our elections is tied directly to public confidence in government. Election integrity has always been a priority for me throughout my time in public office," Griffin said in the release. Bewley will work alongside Ryan Cooper, senior assistant attorney general and chief prosecutor, "to ensure all credible leads are investigated." Supervising the attorney general's election law hotline is among the unit's responsibilities, the release said. Griffin's announcement Monday came shortly after the state House of Representatives sent a bill that aims to create the Election Integrity Unit back to the House Committee on State Agencies and Governmental Affairs. Bill sponsor Rep. Austin McCollum, R-Bentonville, requested members again refer the bill to the panel to allow for amendment. When asked how the bill would impact the responsibilities of the Election Integrity Unit, Griffin said in a written statement provided by a spokesman that the legislation would require the attorney general to establish and maintain the unit rather than leaving it up to the attorney general's discretion. "I am working with legislators to enhance my ability to ensure election integrity through HB1513," Griffin said in the statement. Griffin said amendments that his office is proposing to the bill would be announced soon. "I currently have the ability to investigate election-related misconduct statewide. This bill would not change that," he said in the statement. "Further, I have an election law hotline through which I receive election-related complaints. That would not change under this bill." Last week, the Committee on State Agencies and Governmental Affairs approved a version of the bill that would require the unit to track all alleged violations, complaints and investigations related to election integrity in a database. The unit would have to respond to notifications and complaints regarding alleged violations of voter registration and election laws and refer notifications and complaints to the State Board of Election Commissioners for investigation. The integrity unit also could receive sworn statements and issue subpoenas to compel the production of records and other documents. The bill would require the State Board of Election Commissioners to annually brief lawmakers, the attorney general and the governor on closed election integrity investigations. If during an investigation the board determines there may be a criminal violation of voter registration or election laws, the panel would be permitted under the bill to turn the findings over to the "appropriate prosecutorial agency for criminal prosecution." A prosecuting attorney would be allowed to designate an attorney employed by the attorney general's office as a special deputy prosecutor to prosecute charges.

         One of two twin brothers who pleaded guilty to involvement in a fentanyl distribution ring based in Little Rock was ordered to jail Monday to await sentencing after he failed drug and alcohol screens and overdosed on fentanyl while staying at a motel. Mathew Papez Zuerlein, 31, of Little Rock was indicted in 2019 along with Clifton Williams and 21 others -- including his twin brother Andrew Zuerlein -- on charges related to a fentanyl trafficking conspiracy headed by Williams. In October 2019, Zuerlein was indicted on one count of conspiracy to distribute fentanyl. He pleaded guilty last November to a reduced count of using a telephone in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime -- for which he faces up to four years in prison -- and was allowed to remain on pretrial release pending sentencing. Both brothers had been up for sentencing in July, but both tested positive for marijuana use prior to that hearing, so U.S. District Judge Kristine G. Baker postponed the hearing while allowing both brothers to remain free on bond. According to court records, between Jan. 1 and July 30, 2022, Mathew Zuerlein failed seven drug screens, testing positive for marijuana six times, positive for fentanyl twice, positive for alcohol use once and submitted one urine specimen that was diluted. Then, on Feb. 14, he overdosed on fentanyl while staying at a Little Rock motel and was taken to an emergency room for treatment. A week later, the U.S. attorney's office filed motions for an arrest warrant and revocation of his bond. On Friday, Mathew Zuerlein turned himself in to the Little Rock FBI field office and was booked into the Pulaski County jail, said his attorney, Blake Hendrix of Little Rock. Baker noted that a pre-sentencing report prepared by the U.S. Probation Office had been completed as a precursor to sentencing but that no date had been set for sentencing. "We can take up that matter, but first let's talk about what to do with respect to Mr. Zuerlein moving forward," Baker said. Baker noted that Zuerlein had struggled with substance use throughout the duration of the case and said she had three options to consider: detention, residential substance abuse treatment, "or you get released on some other conditions and I'm open to suggestions from both parties." Hendrix said he had located bed space at an inpatient facility in Searcy and a chemical-free living facility in Little Rock. However, he said, one issue was Zuerlein's employment. "Matthew is recently employed in a good job with an understanding employer," he said. "It would be beneficial for him to keep that job, but obviously you would want him under some pretty severe restrictions." Assistant U.S. Attorney Benecia Moore, although not making a specific case for detention, noted that several release options had been tried since Zuerlein's indictment, without success. "He has been in inpatient rehab ... outpatient rehab, etc. and yet we find ourselves here culminating in his overdose a couple of weeks ago," she said. "I don't know to what extent we're trying the same things and expecting different results ... It's his life at stake. We want to get him to and through this sentencing hearing and work on his future, but we are concerned about his safety, the safety of his baby and wife and any others in his small community." "I understand addiction, I really do," Baker said. "I'll be very candid, the timeline with the new job and the understanding employer, trying to square that with the events from the police report, all that seems to have been going on at the same time." Hendrix said he shared Baker's concerns and said he believed Zuerlein's missteps were fueled by drug addiction. He said the overdose may have been a turning point. "The overdose has just flat scared him to death," Hendrix said. "This is his first experience sitting in the Pulaski County jail, and he expressed to me today what an eye-opener that is as well. So, there's already been some consequence to this." Following a brief recess, Baker returned to say the most important task at hand was to ensure that Zuerlein would make it to his sentencing in good health and sound mind. She said although the pre-sentence report was completed, the case could not progress until a sentencing date was set. "So here's what I'm going to say about this whole situation," Baker announced. "As the pressure built for the first plea, we scuttled it because you came in and tested positive." Despite that, she said, she allowed Zuerlein to remain on bond, but now she would have to order him into custody. "I need you to stay healthy, and I need you to stay clean and [that] we resolve this pending sentencing with no other slip-ups," Baker said. "The way to do that is to keep you detained."

         A Crittenden County man set to enter a guilty plea Monday to possession of a machine gun was instead taken into custody and his hearing canceled after he tested positive for drug use. Dewun Moss, 24, of Earle, who is facing a possible 10-year maximum prison sentence, arrived at the Richard Sheppard Arnold U.S. Courthouse in Little Rock about a half-hour prior to his hearing, but shortly after that U.S. District Judge Lee Rudofsky was notified that Moss had tested positive for marijuana use. Just before the hearing was to begin, Rudofsky's courtroom deputy informed Assistant U.S. Attorney Bart Dickinson and Moss' attorney, Brooks Wiggins, of the drug screen result. "I understand that Mr. Moss has tested presumptively positive for marijuana," Rudofsky said, as he opened the hearing. "At this point I don't think I have any choice but to take Mr. Moss into custody. That is the policy of this district and the one that I've chosen to follow as well." Rudofsky ordered Moss taken into custody and said a hearing date will be set at a later date after "hopefully the marijuana is out of his system." "Just so you understand," the judge said to Moss, "the reason we do this is that if you are going to plead guilty, I can't accept your plea unless it's knowing and voluntary, and it can't be knowing and voluntary if you are under the influence of marijuana or other drugs, so we're going to take you into custody, we're going to let it get out of your system and then we will reschedule this hearing." Moss was arrested August 22 after a traffic stop. According to an arrest report, he was one of three passengers in a silver 2004 Chevrolet Malibu driven by 22-year-old Tyreek Green of Earle that was pulled over by a Crittenden County sheriff's deputy on Arkansas 149 south of Earle at Ollier Road just before 4 p.m. The report said the three passengers were "moving about quite a bit" as the deputy approached the vehicle and that a strong smell of marijuana was emanating from it. After Green consented to a search of the vehicle, the report said, officers discovered a Glock 19 9mm pistol fitted with a "Glock switch" machine-gun conversion device underneath a cushion placed directly beneath where Moss was sitting. A check on the firearm, the report said, showed that it had been stolen out of Tennessee. Moss was charged in Crittenden County Circuit Court with violation of the Arkansas Uniform Machine Gun Act, possession of firearms by certain persons and theft by receiving. After he was indicted in November on federal charges of possession of a firearm by a felon and possession of a machine gun, the state charges were dismissed. Following the hearing, Moss conferred briefly with family members before he was taken into custody by U.S. marshals.

         Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders will appoint Susan Peacock to the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board, Sanders announced Monday. Peacock is a vice president at Ingeborg with more than 15 years of experience across federal government and private sectors, the governor's office said in a news release. She also chairs the board of Mercy Health Foundation Northwest Arkansas and sits on the boards of The New School in Fayetteville and Heartland Action. Peacock's term on the board will expire Jan. 14, 2029, and she will replace Fredrick Black of Lake Village, the governor's office said. Sanders also has appointed board member Alex Blass of Rogers as board chairman to replace Black, who has served as chairman. Sanders said Peacock's "wealth of experience serving Arkansans and Americans in both the public and private sectors makes her the clear choice to serve our state in this capacity. "Susan is a respected leader who will be an excellent addition to the Board in overseeing safe regulations and permitting while fostering economic development," the Republican governor said. Before joining Ingeborg, she helped launch the Heartland Summit, bringing together leaders from across the country to stimulate economic growth in the American Heartland, according to the governor's office. At Booz Allen Hamilton, she led communications change management efforts for the office of the director of National Intelligence and Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, the governor's office said. She was appointed by President George W. Bush to the National Security Council of the White House and U.S. State Department, and she coordinated the evacuation of U.S. citizens from Lebanon during its 2006 military crisis. She also served as a congressional aide to U.S. House Majority Leader Dick Armey and Majority Whip Roy Blunt before joining the Bush-Cheney 2004 presidential campaign. Other Alcoholic Beverage Control Board members include Pamela DePriest of Morrilton, Jamie Anderson of Scott and Steven Smith of Springdale, according to the board's website. Alcoholic Beverage Control Division attorney Michael Lewis is currently serving as the agency's interim director. Lewis joined the agency as an attorney specialist in February 2020 and was named interim director by Sanders on Feb. 24, according to state Department of Finance and Administration spokesman Scott Hardin. Lewis' salary is $96,960 a year. The Alcoholic Beverage Control Division's previous director, Doralee Chandler, resigned effective Feb. 18 after serving in the post since her appointment by former Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson in 2018. She subsequently started work as deputy attorney general for the state agencies division under Republican Attorney General Tim Griffin.

         At least two bills moving through the Arkansas Legislature could ease the Watson Chapel School District's burdens as it seeks to begin building a new high school. Rep. Mike Holcomb, R-Pine Bluff, whose constituency includes the district, is one of the sponsors of Senate Bill 355, which would push the date to begin requiring an educational facility to have a storm shelter to Jan. 1, 2025. The bill passed the Senate on Thursday and has been referred to the House Education Committee, which will review the bill today. If passed, the bill would keep the district from having to face an additional financial strain as it requests more money from the Legislature to cover the state's share of the cost to construct a new high school to replace a 78-year-old junior high campus deemed to have no useful life remaining. House Bill 1254 would change the state financial participation amount by using a basic project cost per square foot for new public-school construction projects. The bill, which has passed in the House, would change the language in state law so that the amount "shall be," rather than "is limited to," the amount derived from using the academic facilities wealth index to the project cost to calculate the cost necessary to bring the education facilities to code. "The Division of Public School Academic Facilities and Transportation shall establish funding factors that shall be updated annually by the fourth quarter of the calendar year for determining the basic project cost per square foot for various types of new construction projects," the bill reads, in part. The WCSD was approved for $200 per square foot toward a 92,500-square-foot high school, but Wilson said during Monday's school board meeting that costs have risen to about $350 per square foot and the district is hoping to receive at least $275 per square foot in funding from the state. The bill has gone to the Senate, where the Education Committee will review it Wednesday. The district revealed a building grade plan based on whether the district is approved for additional funding. If officials can start on the new high school by the fall, second-graders would be relocated from L.L. Owen Elementary to Edgewood Elementary, students in grades 3-5 would attend Coleman Elementary, sixth-graders would be housed at Watson Chapel Junior High, seventh- and eighth-graders would attend Owen along with pre-kindergartners, and ninth-graders would move up to Watson Chapel High. If the project has to be delayed, sixth-graders would remain at Coleman and seventh- and eighth-graders would attend the junior high campus. IN OTHER DISTRICT MATTERS Wilson requested to the state Division of Elementary and Secondary Education to change the WCSD's digital learning plan to allow students disciplined due to group or gang violence at school to use Google Classroom, rather than Virtual Arkansas, for online courses. "Recently, there has been an increase of students involved in group or gang activity in the community," Wilson wrote. "Due to this increase, safety is our number one goal for our staff and students." A recent study of Watson Chapel's football field showed the artificial turf "is suffering from significant fiber wear and loss," according to a letter from Southern Turf Specialties of Monticello. The field, first installed in 2011, is safe to play on for at least another year, but John Hayden, executive director of support services for the WCSD, suggested the board consider making any renovations to the field after the 2023 football season. George White, a retiring junior high paraprofessional, pitched to the board an idea to begin a wrestling program for both boys and girls. Although White said a statewide wrestling association would be willing to pay for about half the cost of a wrestling mat, Wilson suggested the district consider beginning with a wrestling club to help build interest in the sport. Brad Burl, a teacher at Coleman Elementary, volunteered to coach wrestling if a program were to begin. WILDCAT WARRIORS Sophomore high school student Simone Simon was named Wildcat Warrior for March. The district-wide dyslexia team of Tristen Imler, Earnestine Marshall, Betty Thomas, Daisy Pugh and Rosalind Robinson were named district employees of the month. PERSONNEL MOVES The district accepted retirement letters from secretary Janice Oaks, cafeteria worker Pearline Price, counselor Julie Taylor and paraprofessional White. Resignation letters were submitted by secretaries Constance Howard and LaPorsche Scott, and elementary teacher Regina Jones.

         WEST MEMPHIS -- Officials in Arkansas say they are investigating the death of a high school senior as a homicide after the 18-year-old was found dead in a Mississippi national forest. Fredarrious Wilson, who was last seen in his hometown of West Memphis on March 5, was found in a remote section of the Holly Springs National Forest near Coffeeville, Miss., about 80 miles southeast of West Memphis, on Wednesday. Wilson's mother, Shirley Howell, told local news outlets that her son said he was going to the movies with a friend, but said she later learned he was with someone else. Investigators received a signal from Wilson's phone in Yalobusha County, Miss., but searchers didn't find the body, which was off a rural road, until Wednesday. Howell told WHBQ-TV that her son rarely strayed far from home. "He was a whole momma's boy," she said. "He joked around and liked to play. He went to school, went to work, played videos and stayed up all night."  Print Headline: 18-year-olds death probed as homicide Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         100 years ago Mar. 14, 1923 That 1922 was a good business year in Arkansas is evidenced by the fact that the income tax receipts yesterday were $81,722.70 in excess of the receipts for the same period last year, according to figures made public by H.L. Remmel, local collector of United States Internal Revenue. The increase, occurring in spite of the fact that rulings within the past year have lessened materially the tax, can be taken only as a indication of increased prosperity, Mr.Remmel said. Receipts from January 1 up to yesterday were $931,275.67. For the similar period of 1922 the receipts were $831,522.97. This year the surtax and excess profits tax have been eliminated and a considerably larger amount of exemptions allowed, but at the same time the actual tax receipts have increased. 50 years ago Mar. 14, 1973 Radio station KRAA-FM, which was recently purchased by Mann Media, has changed its call letters to KEZQ-FM and changed its format. The station began using the new call letters Monday. Dino Summerlin, general manager, said the station would play only "beautiful music"-- music that has been "scientifically determined to be pleasing on a subliminal scale." All the music will be familiar, and melodies must begin in five seconds from the song's first note, he said. 25 years ago Mar. 14, 1998 BATESVILLE -- It's a sound that north Arkansas residents are hearing more and more. Blame it on "Aedes albopictus." The pest commonly known as the Asian tiger mosquito has given the Ozarks sights, sensations and sounds previously limited to southern and eastern Arkansas: little red welts, itching and the slapping of skin. "In Harrison, Heber Springs, Fayetteville, Mountain Home people are noticing a mosquito problem," said David Jamieson, a biology instructor at the Newport campus of Arkansas State University-Beebe Branch. 10 years ago Mar. 14, 2013 Arkansas Catholics celebrated Wednesday afternoon over the naming of the first Latin American pope. Francis is the first Latin American pope and the first Jesuit in the papacy. The Rev. Jason Tyler, priest at St. Edward, said the Jesuits, formally known as the Society of Jesus, have been around for centuries. The religious order of priests and monks was started by Ignatius of Loyola in 1534 and formally recognized by Pope Paul III in 1540. The Jesuits are the largest religious order in the Catholic Church with more than 19,000 members who take vows of poverty, chastity and obedience.

         HOT SPRINGS -- Downtown Hot Springs is packed with visitors this week as several neighboring states celebrate their respective spring breaks in the Spa City. Schools in Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas are among the states celebrating their weeklong break this week, and a glance at license plates driving down Central Avenue shows visitors from Kansas and even as far away as Alaska. "Last week, there were some spring breaks that had already begun," Bill Solleder, marketing director for Visit Hot Springs, said Monday. "Technically starting this Friday, St. Patrick's Day, is the beginning of Arkansas'. When you see spring break lists, it lists the Monday, but it really starts as soon as that bell hits on Friday." Solleder said he notes the number of visitors on his way to work each morning. "I live Uptown, so when I drive through downtown every day, I'm looking at just a couple of just very easy ways to know how busy it's going to be," he said. "And that's how long is the line at Colonial [Pancake and Waffle House], how long is the line at The Pancake Shop, the Buckstaff and the Quapaw [bathhouses]. This morning, Monday morning, literally the line [at Buckstaff Baths] was all the way to the sidewalk, so I know it's going to be busy." The Hot Springs Visitor Center reported visitors from 19 states and Spain on Saturday, he said. "Kansas and Iowa were well represented this weekend," he said. "When we reach out to the surrounding states and find out when the spring breaks are for the touch states to Arkansas, we normally don't go a state further -- Kansas, even Illinois or Iowa -- but the Visitor Center reported that there was a bunch of guests here from Kansas and Iowa," he said. "So whatever's happening, the word is getting out there. People are curious, and they're wanting to come visit Hot Springs, and that's a great thing." With the Arkansas state high school basketball championships held at Bank OZK Arena over the weekend, several fans decided to stick around after the games. "During basketball this weekend, I was talking to some parents from Salem, who went on to win the championships in the girls, and they were just so excited to be here for the weekend because they get to come watch their daughter play basketball," he said. "And then it's just not like play the game, get on the bus and go back home; they made a weekend out of it. They stayed here, and to them it was like coming to the big city. We think of it as a little town, but for some little towns, it's a big city." Solleder also noted the cherry blossoms and tulips seemed to bloom earlier this year. "I think Mother Nature's just doing what Mother Nature does, and it's not my place to question what's happening," he said with a laugh. "So I do feel like there's been some great days, some great spring days. Of course, we're looking really close at the weather right now because of St. Pat's, and that forecast continues to change by the minute. "So right now, it looks like it's going to be a beautiful day, albeit a little bit chilly. We should have some rain on Thursday, and then we should be clear after that. So that's a good thing. The weather is usually on our side." Kristin Mangham, marketing director for Garvan Woodland Gardens, said the tulips are at their peak this week. "We had that week of warmer weather, and so that really made them start blooming," she said. "They are at peak this week, so it's prime viewing to see the most color for tulips right now." The facility, a botanical garden of the University of Arkansas, has already started to see an increase in visitors. "It's our second-busiest time of year," she said, noting Holiday Lights is the busiest. "Spring happens to be my favorite time of the year in the garden. There is tons of color. We planted over 150,000 tulips this year. Really the show is remarkable. I think that everybody is excited for spring and warm weather, and Tulips [Extravaganza] is kind of like the beginning of that. It welcomes everybody in, so it's a huge draw for us." While tulips are perennial plants, Mangham said Garvan Woodland Gardens digs up and replants bulbs each year for the best results. "The Gardens has a lot of shade, and tulips need a lot of sun when they die off to get the bulb ready for the next year," she said. "And we want to ensure that we have a full show every year, so we actually dig all of them up and then replant new tulip bulbs every year." With 160 different varieties of tulips, there are colors, shapes and sizes for everyone. "Some of them are your standard tulip that you're gonna see everywhere," she said. "We have parrot tulips that are ruffly and multicolor. We have lots of variations. There are some that look more like a rose, or more like a peony that are larger. So lots of different kinds to look at." With St. Patrick's Day landing on the Friday before the start of spring break in Arkansas, Solleder said he expects an even larger crowd than normal. "I think this year's biggest draw is the parade's on a Friday with the extra concert on a Saturday," he said, noting Poyen native and country music star Justin Moore will serve as the grand marshal and Christopher McDonald, best-known as Shooter McGavin from "Happy Gilmore," will start the parade. "That and it being Arkansas' spring break. That will bring the numbers way up. ... Everyone always loves the [Dallas Cowboys] cheerleaders. They're increasing their numbers from a dozen to 16 this year, so that'll be fun. So many little kids are wanting to meet the 'Paw Patrol,' so Skye and Marshall will be here," he said. "Saturday night, Village People -- I mean, how iconic can you get? I can't wait to see all of Bridge Street, the whole district, doing the YMCA dance, so it should be fun. It'll be a good time. I expect big numbers for sure."  Print Headline: Spa City ready for spring breakers Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         The Little Rock School District is asking for community participation in several events this week, including two community conversations/forums, the School Board's regular monthly business meeting and a school-based pantry drive titled "Stock the Rock the Wright Way." Superintendent Jermall Wright will preside at two separate "Community Connections & Conversations" sessions, with the first one targeted to the families of Mabelvale Middle School at 5 p.m. today at the school, 10811 Mabelvale West Road. At 6 p.m. on Wednesday , Wright will join City of Little Rock Director Andrea Lewis at the West Central Community Center, 8616 Colonel Glenn Road. The community forums come at a time when Wright has drafted a plan to organize schools into three networks or tiers -- priority, on-watch and autonomous -- with each tier receiving varying levels of district support and resources based on achievement needs of students. To that end, Wright recommended and the School Board last week approved the filling of four new leadership positions. The three newly named assistant superintendents -- who will oversee the networks -- and their base salaries are Shana Spriggs-Loring, $133,104; Amy B. Cooper, $129,289; and Karen Bradshaw, who is a former deputy superintendent in Conway and will earn $141,073. Hal Harris was hired to be executive director of leadership development, at a base salary of $121,985. Also on Wednesday, from noon to 1 p.m., the Little Rock district is inviting members of the public to help stock the pantries at various campuses with non-perishable food that can be prepared without a stove, baby-care products, personal hygiene items and household cleaning products, including detergent. Wright will be on hand at Washington Elementary for the drive-thru/drop-off pantry drive but other schools are also asking for supplies. More detailed information can be found about what Washington and the other schools need here: https://www.lrsd.org/STRWrightWay. Not all schools made requests for support but those schools have been enlisted to collect items on behalf of a neighboring Little Rock schools that have made requests. District leaders are asking those people who drop off any items at a school to take a couple of photos at the drop-off and post them to to social media, using #StocktheRock as a way to spread the word about the pantry drive. The Little Rock School Board will meet at 5:30 p.m. Thursday at the district office 810 W. Markham St., for its regular monthly business meeting. Agenda items include a proposal to divide schools into tiered categories of support, with those schools that have the lowest state-applied A to F letter grades becoming "priority" schools and receiving greater district support than "on-watch" and "autonomous" schools. The meeting is open to the public. The district also streams its meetings on its YouTube page. For quick access, viewers may type www.lrsdlive.com into their browsers and be directly connected to the District's YouTube page. The District also streams meetings on LRSDTV.org, and broadcasts on Comcast Channel 4 and U-verse Channel 99.

         NLR man in car shot in buttocks A North Little Rock man told police he was shot in Little Rock early Saturday while riding in the back seat of a car. Police responding to the a report of a shooting at 12:15 a.m. found Ivan Rodriguez, 20, in a Honda Civic parked at the post office on West Markham Street near Rodney Parham Road, according to an incident report. Rodriguez's cousin, Jamie Rodriguez, 19, also of North Little Rock, told police he was driving the car when a stranger in a black hooded sweatshirt approached it at Fairfield Drive and Oak Grove Lane, the report says. He said he sped off, and the person started shooting, striking the rear left side of the car and hitting his cousin, the report says. He said he headed to a hospital but had to pull into the post office after one of the car's tires went flat, the report says. Ivan Rodriguez told police he did not see anything but heard gunshots and felt "a burning sensation in his left buttock area," according to the report. Ivan Rodriguez was taken to a hospital for treatment, the report says. Gunshots hit car, ricochet at house A car parked in a Little Rock's Hillcrest neighborhood was shot about 13 times on Friday morning, with several of the bullets ricocheting into a nearby house, according to a police report. A man who lives on the 5100 block of F Street told police he woke up Friday and discovered his house had been struck by gunfire. He said he reviewed video footage from his doorbell camera that showed someone get out of a car at about 1:20 a.m. and open fire on a neighbor's car, with some of the bullets ricocheting into his house. The car's owner told police she had tried to call 911 after the shooting, but no one answered. The officer who wrote the report said the city's emergency call center didn't have a record of a call from the woman's number. The officer noted 13 bullet holes in the car's hood and driver-side fender, two in the front window of the house of the man who called the police and several along the sides of the house.

         Fresh and familiar faces for Pulaski County voters have declared their intentions in recent days to run in next year's judicial elections. Molly McNulty, a Court of Appeals clerk, says she will seek the court's District 6, Position 1, to succeed the retiring Rita Gruber for the appeals judgeship representing Perry, Pulaski and Saline counties in the March 2024 elections, which coincide with the state's political primaries. Pulaski County Circuit Judge Mackie Pierce, the most senior judge of the 6th Judicial Circuit of Perry and Pulaski counties, has announced his intention to run for the Little Rock District criminal judge position being vacated next year by Melanie Martin, who is running for a circuit judge post. The district court judgeship is also being pursued by Jill Kamps, a longtime prosecutor who manages the prosecutors in the circuit's six district courts. Pierce, 68 and elected to the bench in 1998, is retiring next year due to a law that requires all circuit judges and above to forfeit their judicial retirement if they turn 70 before starting a new term. That prohibition does not apply to district judges. Describing his tenure as circuit judge as a "privilege," Pierce said he wants to continue his public survive. "Public service is my passion. I love my job, and look forward to my work as a judge," Pierce said in his campaign announcement. "My experience of trying thousands of cases the past 24 plus years, uniquely qualifies me for a district judge position." Pierce has held several leadership roles during his tenure, including president and treasurer of the Pulaski County Bar Association and president of the William R. Overton Inn of Court. He is currently president of the Arkansas Judicial Council, which is composed of the justices of the Arkansas Supreme Court and the judges from the Court of Appeals and the state's circuits. He's also been recognized as Pulaski County Circuit Judge of the Year numerous times, most recently in 2022. McNulty, 38, has been the law clerk for Court of Appeals Judge Raymond Abramson since 2015, and she credits that job with providing her "valuable experience specific to the appellate court system, including writing hundreds of draft opinions and advising on complex legal issues." "I am running for the Court of Appeals because I want to continue to serve Arkansans in a meaningful way by faithfully upholding the principles of justice under the Constitution and laws of our state," McNulty said in her campaign announcement. "My experience working in the appellate court system has prepared me to take on this important role." McNulty has also been an adjunct professor at the Bowen School of Law at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock. She began her legal career as a law clerk for U.S. Magistrate Judge Joe Volpe. The daughter of retired Circuit Judge Mary McGowan, McNulty said she has committed her life to public service and is one of the first master's graduates of the Public Service Academy at the University of Arkansas Clinton School of Public Service. A married mother of two, McNulty is active in a wide range of community organizations, including the Arkansas Bar Association, the Central Arkansas Library System Foundation, the Leadership Greater Little Rock Alumni Association, Camp Aldersgate, the Arkansas Repertory Theatre, the Historic Arkansas Museum Foundation, the Arkansas Symphony Orchestra, The Rotary Club of Little Rock and the Junior League of Little Rock.

         HOT SPRINGS -- Action the Hot Springs Board of Directors took last week intends to hold the line on costs for the water treatment plant the city is building off Amity Road. A resolution the board adopted at its March 7 business meeting approved a $1.59 million change order, raising the original $34.95 million cost of the new plant to $39.86 million and eliminating an amendment agreed to in September that made the city responsible for price escalations in materials, supplies and labor. "Upon receipt of any such price increase, the contractor shall provide notice of the price increase to the city and the agreement shall be increased to incorporate such increase in price plus a markup of 15%," according to the first paragraph of the addendum The Sentinel-Record first reported on in December. A $3.32 million change order the city agreed to last fall raised the cost of the TOLM Group's construction contract for the 15 million-gallon-a-day plant to $38.27 million, about $15 million more than the city and its contract engineers had estimated before the July bid opening. The higher-than-expected bids put the Lake Ouachita water supply project over budget, leading the board to approve a rate increase in November that's servicing more than $45 million in new water fund debt. The $4-a-month increase, which goes into full effect in November, for city utility customers inside the incorporated area followed a series of rate increases that took effect from 2018 to 2021. The latter services the $109 million bond issue the board authorized in June 2020. "With this change order to the contract, it's still $8 million less than the next-lowest bidder," Major Capital Projects Manager Todd Piller said, referring to the $47.60 million bid CDI Contractors of Little Rock submitted in July, told the board. McKee Utility Contractors of Oklahoma bid $54.35 million, the highest of the three the city received. The $3.32 million change order extended the plant completion date from spring 2024 to late 2025. Piller told the board last week that delivery times are more than a year for some equipment and materials. The city has blamed supply chain disruptions for increasing what was a $106 million project in 2019 to more than $150 million. The change order approved last week will be paid for from the proceeds of a $45 million bond issue that the board authorized in November. Funds were deposited into the construction account at the end of January, but the city said no money had been spent as of last week. The $1.25 million addition to Belt Construction's $9.17 million raw waterline contract the board approved last month had yet to be debited from 2022 bond funds. In addition to the nearly $40 million cost of building the new plant, contracts totaling more than $6 million have been awarded for site preparation and a 3 million-gallon clear well at the 33-acre Randall Road site the city acquired in 2019. Piller told the board last week that the 160-foot diameter clear well recently passed a leak test. It will hold treated water and high-service pumps will distribute via the large-diameter finished waterline. Natgun Corp. was awarded the $4.19 million contract in 2021. Kajacs Construction completed the first 2.5-mile segment of the 13-mile finished waterline in 2021. It was awarded the $4.43 million contract in 2020. CDI Contractors completed the $2.02 million site prep. It included building two 4 million-gallon backwash ponds for treated water that will be discharged into a nearby creek after it's used to clean the plant's filters.

         A vehicle that state police said was involved in a fatal pedestrian crash on Thursday has been found, a news release from the Arkansas State Police said Monday. The crash occurred on U.S. 82 in Lafayette County, the release said. State police said Friday that they were seeking the public's help with finding "a 2006-2007 silver Toyota RAV4." The Toyota was said to likely have sustained damage to the passenger side. Where the vehicle was found was not immediately released. Troopers said the pedestrian who was killed when he was struck by the vehicle was an 85-year-old resident of Springhill, La., who was visiting family. A preliminary fatality report published Thursday identified the victim as Joseph Miller.  Print Headline: Police: Vehicle from fatal crash found Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         A bill that would require the governor to fill a vacant Little Rock airport commissioner post in the event a commissioner appointment exceeds 45 days of vacancy narrowly failed to clear the Arkansas Senate Transportation, Technology and Legislative Affairs Committee on Monday. Senate Bill 379 by Sen. Mark Johnson, R-Ferndale, also would require at least two members of the seven-member airport commission to be fully experienced in aviation -- up from the current requirement of at least one member to be fully experienced in aviation -- and for one of the two members to hold some type of pilot aeronautical rating. If an application for membership on the commission is not submitted by a qualified citizen experienced in aviation and holding some type of aeronautical rating, then the city board may waive this requirement under the bill. In a municipality with a municipal airport that is nationally ranked in the top 125 airports in the Federal Aviation Administrations' annual report, the airport commissioners would be required to be appointed by the mayor or any of the elected qualified members of the city board and confirmed by a three-fourths vote of the city board under the bill, but the governor would appoint a commissioner in the event that a commission appointment exceeds 45 days of vacancy. Under the bill, a municipal airport commission would not have authority over the employment or removal of an employee at the municipal airport, other than the airport's executive director. Johnson told the Senate committee that he chairs that he filed the bill because there has been an impasse over filling a vacancy on the Little Rock airport commission for more than 60 days, and the airport has a statewide impact and serves at least 60 of the state's 75 counties. Little Rock Mayor Frank Scott Jr. told the Senate committee that he opposes the bill because it sets a bad precedent against long-standing mayoral appointment of airport commissioners, with confirmation by the city board. "We had a commission appointment become vacant in January, [and] that particular commissioner was Mark Camp. He is an aviation pilot," he said. The commission already has a pilot among the six commissioners, and the governor would appoint a second pilot after an airport commission vacancy of more than 45 days under the bill that appears to be drafted for the appointment of one person, he said. Scott said the only reason the post is currently vacant is because he made a nomination to fill the vacancy in an executive session, and the city board did not approve it with a three-fourths vote. He said he will more than likely call a meeting of the city board today or later this week with the aim of filling the vacancy. Johnson said he has been informed that Camp does not want to be reappointed. "This gridlock is holding up contracts and other services," and hurts the ability of the airport's executive director to carry out his job, he said. "This is a corrective measure that hopefully won't arise again." The Senate committee's 4-2 vote for SB379 fell one vote short of the five votes required for approval on the eight-member committee. Republican Sens. Justin Boyd of Fort Smith, Alan Clark of Lonsdale, Ricky Hill of Cabot and Johnson voted for the bill, while Democratic Sens. Linda Chesterfield of Little Rock and Reginald Murdock of Marianna voted against the bill. Sen. Terry Rice, R-Waldron, did not vote on the bill. Sen. Jane English, R-North Little Rock, did not attend the meeting. CORRECTION: Mark Camp is a former Little Rock airport commissioner. Camps name was misspelled in an earlier version of this article.

         Tonight's meeting of the School Board for the Pulaski County Special School District has been postponed. Jessica Duff, a spokeswoman for the district, said a new date has not yet been selected. The district will announce the new date and the meeting agenda when they become available. She attributed the need to call off tonight's meeting to scheduling conflicts among board members. School Board President Stephen Delaney called the scheduling situation "fluid." He said he anticipates the new date for the board's March meeting will very likely have to be sometime after the annual spring break vacation for the district, which is March 20 through March 24.

        The Little Rock School District is asking for community participation in several events this week, including two community conversations/forums, the School Boards regular monthly business meeting and a school-based pantry drive titled “Stock the Rock the Wright Way.”  Superintendent Jermall Wright will preside at two separate “Community Connections & Conversations” sessions, with the first one targeted to the families of Mabelvale Middle School at 5 p.m. Tuesday at the school, 10811 Mabelvale West Road. At 6 p.m. on Wednesday, Wright will join City of Little Rock Director Andrea Lewis at the West Central Community Center, 8616 Colonel Glenn Road. The community forums come at a time when Wright has drafted a plan to organize schools into three networks or tiers — priority, on-watch and autonomous — with each tier receiving varying levels of district support and reources based on achievement needs of students. To that end, Wright recommended and the School Board last week approved the filling of four new leadership positions. The three newly named assistant superintendents — who will oversee the networks — and their base salaries are Shana Spriggs-Loring, $133,104; Amy B. Cooper, $129,289; and Karen Bradshaw, who is a former deputy superintendent in Conway and will earn $141,073. Hal Harris was hired to be executive director of leadership development, at a base salary of $121,985. Also on Wednesday, from noon to 1 p.m., the Little Rock district is inviting members of the public to help stock the pantries at various campuses with non-perishable food that can be prepared without a stove, baby-care products, personal hygiene items and household cleaning products, including detergent. Wright will be on hand at Washington Elementary for the drive-through/drop-off pantry drive but other schools are also asking for supplies. More detailed information can be found about what Washington and the other schools need here: https://www.lrsd.org/STRWrightWay. Not all schools made requests for support but those schools have been enlisted to collect items on behalf of a neighboring Little Rock schools that have made requests. District leaders are asking those people who drop off any items at a school to take a couple of photos at the drop-off and post them to to social media, using #StocktheRock as a way to spread the word about the pantry drive. The Little Rock School Board will meet at 5:30 p.m. Thursday March 16 at the district office 810 W. Markham St., for its regular monthly business meeting. Agenda items include a proposal to divide schools into tiered categories of support, with those schools that have the lowest state-applied A to F letter grades becoming “priority” schools and receiving greater district support than “on-watch” and “autonomous” schools. The meeting is open to the public. The district also streams its meetings on its YouTube page. For quick access, viewers may type www.lrsdlive.com into their browsers and be directly connected to the Districts YouTube page. The District also streams meetings on LRSDTV.org, and broadcasts on Comcast Channel 4 and U-verse Channel 99. Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        A Senate panel on Monday passed a bill intended to address a seven-year misinterpretation of state law by the Arkansas Department of Corrections which lawmakers said resulted in nearly 300 inmates convicted of residential burglary losing their eligibility for parole despite what they were told at the time of their convictions. The Committee on Judiciary advanced Senate Bill 366 by Sen. Joshua Bryant, R-Rogers, on a voice vote. The measure moves to the full Senate for further consideration. Bryant said his bill is needed to address an interpretation error that originated after a 2015 law designated residential burglary as a violent felony offense. The reclassification of residential burglary included in the Criminal Justice Reform Act of 2015 impacted parole eligibility for certain offenders since state law requires a person convicted of a violent felony offense who has previously been found guilty of a violent felony to serve 100% of their sentence. During the seven-year period covered by his bill, Bryant said the state Department of Corrections did not consider residential burglaries committed before the 2015 act to be violent felony offenses. Courts and attorneys used this guidance when negotiating plea arraignments and calculating sentences. In May, then-Attorney General Leslie Rutledge said in an opinion requested by the state Department of Corrections that any person convicted of residential burglary who commits an additional violent felony on or after April 1, 2015, should not be eligible for parole. Officials with the Department of Corrections told lawmakers in October that the policy change led to 290 inmates losing their parole eligibility and resulted in the re-incarceration of two people with prior convictions for residential burglary. To address the misinterpretation, SB 366 would remove the "violent felony" classification for residential burglary offenses committed before April 1, 2015. The bill applies to defendants sentenced before May 24, 2022, unless the sentencing order expressly designates the defendant was sentenced under state law classifying residential burglary as a violent offense. Defense attorney Jeff Rosenzweig, who presented the bill alongside Bryant, said the bill would not erase any convictions or mandate an offender's release. "It merely reinstates the thought-through stated policy recorded in writing over and over again by the Department of Corrections," Rosenzweig said. Bryant said he was not looking for "empathy or sympathy" for offenders but said his bill was needed "for the state to honor its word" "Once someone from a high level tells you something, you take it to the bank," he said.

        The Arkansas Senate on Monday approved a bill that would restrict transgender people from using a bathroom of their choice at public and open enrollment charter schools. The Senate voted 29-6 to approve House Bill 1156 by Rep. Mary Bentley, R-Perryville, sending the bill to the House of Representatives to consider a Senate amendment. The bill will require public schools and open enrollment charter schools to prohibit people from using a mutual-occupancy restroom that does not correspond with the sex listed on their birth certificate. The bill also would apply to places at schools where people "may be in various stages of undress" around others, which would include locker rooms, changing rooms or shower rooms.

        A bill that would prohibit school staff from addressing students by their preferred pronoun or name was re-referred to committee Monday. House Bill 1468, by Rep. Wayne Long, R-Bradford, would require written permission from parents before school employees could address students by a pronoun inconsistent with a students biological sex or a name other than the one listed on their birth certificate. The bill would not apply to derivative names, such as “Bob” for “Robert,” Long said. Long asked the House of Representatives to send the bill back committee, saying it needed to be amended. The House Education Committee approved the bill last week with Long saying it was needed to protect teachers from being compelled to address students by a pronoun inconsistent with their biological sex. Some testified against the bill, saying it was another attempt by the Legislature to single out transgender people in the state.  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        The Jonesboro police are investigating a shooting that killed a 37-year-old man on Friday, the department said in a Facebook post.  Nicholas Childs of Jonesboro was found suffering from an apparent gunshot wound in the 600 block of Southwest Drive when officers arrived, the post said on Friday.  Childs was found dead at the scene, Sally Smith, a spokesperson for the Jonesboro police, said Monday afternoon.  The investigation led by the criminal investigation division established that the two people involved in this crime knew each other, police said.  “This was not a random act of violence,” the post said.  “We have not arrested a suspect as of now; we are looking for a person of interest. No suspect name will be released at this time,” Smith said.  The police have asked that anyone with information contact the department by calling (870) 935-5657 or calling CrimeStoppers of Jonesboro at (870) 935-STOP (7867).  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders will appoint Susan Peacock to the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board, Sanders announced Monday. Peacock is a vice president at Ingeborg with more than 15 years of experience across federal government and private sectors, the governors office said in a news release. She also chairs the board of Mercy Health Foundation Northwest Arkansas and sits on the boards of The New School in Fayetteville and Heartland Action. Peacocks term on the board will expire Jan. 14, 2029, and she will replace Fredrick Black of Lake Village, the governors office said. Sanders also has appointed board member Alex Blass of Rogers as board chairman to replace Black, who has served as chairman. Sanders said Peacocks “wealth of experience serving Arkansans and Americans in both the public and private sectors makes her the clear choice to serve our state in this capacity. “Susan is a respected leader who will be an excellent addition to the Board in overseeing safe regulations and permitting while fostering economic development,” the Republican governor said. The other Alcoholic Beverage Control Board members include Pamela DePriest of Morrilton, Jamie Anderson of Scott and Steven Smith of Springdale, according to the boards website. Alcoholic Beverage Control Division attorney Michael Lewis is currently serving as the agencys interim director. Lewis joined the agency as an attorney specialist in February 2020 and was named as interim director by Sanders on Feb. 24, according to state Department of Finance and Administration spokesman Scott Hardin. The Alcoholic Beverage Control Divisions previous director, Doralee Chandler, resigned effective Feb. 18, after serving in the post since her appointment by former Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson in 2018. She subsequently started work as deputy attorney general for the state agencies division under Republican Attorney General Tim Griffin.

        FAYETTEVILLE -- The University of Arkansas has named a new vice chancellor for university advancement. Scott Varady is set to take on the role effective April 17. He is a University of Arkansas alumnus, who is currently the director of the Razorback Foundation. "During some challenging times, Scott provided transformative leadership in building an outstanding team of fundraising professionals who helped the Razorback Foundation become a full-menu, fundraising organization; successfully cultivated hundreds of friends and volunteers; and raised millions of dollars in private gift support benefiting Razorback student-athletes, athletics programs and facilities," Robinson said in a press release. Throughout Varady's tenure at the Razorback Foundation, the organization raised more than $71 million for the expansion and renovation of Donald W. Reynolds Razorback Stadium, the Frank O'Mara Track and Field Performance Center and the J.B. and Johnelle Hunt Family Baseball Development Center. Varady will be replacing the outgoing Vice Chancellor Mark Power, who will remain with the university as a senior adviser.

        A freeze warning has been issued for much of the state until Tuesday morning as temperatures are expected to drop, meteorologists with the National Weather Service said on Monday.  “Recently, weve had a drastic pattern change after a mild winter,” said John Lewis, a meteorologist with the weather service in North Little Rock. Northern Arkansas is expected to see temperatures well into the 20s, Lewis said, and those farther south in the state might see temperatures in the 30s.  “The potential for a widespread freeze is becoming likely Tuesday morning across the northern two-thirds of Arkansas, and over portions of northeast Arkansas on Wednesday morning,” a hazardous weather outlook issued Monday by the weather service said.  A freeze warning has been issued for Monday night, covering most of northeastern, northern and central parts of the state, a tweet from the weather service said.  “A watch is like a yellow light; people should take caution because the conditions are there,” Lewis said.“A warning is the green light; we are confident and people should get ready.”  A tweet from the weather service said that a warning consists of “temperatures 32 degrees or colder for several hours over a widespread area during the growing season.” The forecaster said that temperatures are not abnormal, but — given the mild winter — things are already budding.  “Were not looking for winter weather or travel impacts. This is mainly an agricultural warning or maybe exposed pipes could be affected,” Lewis said.  “If you have sensitive outdoor plants, it would be a good idea to bring them inside or cover them up,” the tweet from the weather service said.  Little Rock, near the metro area, could see temperatures in the 30s while areas outside but near the city could drop to the upper 20s on Monday night, the meteorologist said.  “Another frost and/or freeze potential will be possible Friday, Saturday, and Sunday mornings over portions, to much, of Arkansas,” the hazardous weather outlook said.  There is a chance of rain in parts of the state on Thursday and Friday, which will be followed by more freezes, a forecast from the office in North Little Rock said.  “The second round in the next part of the week and weekend could be colder,” Lewis said.  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        WEST MEMPHIS, Ark. — Officials in Arkansas say they are investigating the death of a high school senior as a homicide after the 18-year-old was found dead in a Mississippi national forest. Fredarrious Wilson, who was last seen in his hometown of West Memphis, Arkansas on March 5, was found in a remote section of the Holly Springs National Forest near Coffeeville, Mississippi, on Wednesday. That's about 80 miles southeast of West Memphis. Wilson's mother, Shirley Howell, told local news outlets that her son said he was going to the movies with a friend, but said she later learned he was with someone else. Investigators located a signal from Wilson's phone in Yalobusha County, Mississippi, but searchers didn't find the body until Wednesday, off a rural road. Howell told WHBQ-TV that her son rarely strayed far from home. "He was a whole momma's boy," she said. "He joked around and liked to play. He went to school, went to work, played videos and stayed up all night." Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.
