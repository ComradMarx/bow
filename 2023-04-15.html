        The National Weather Service on Saturday extended a severe weather warning for parts of north Arkansas, while issuing a severe weather warning for Russellville, Dardanelle and Atkins. The warning for those three communities was set to last until 5:45 p.m., while the extended warning for Mountain View, Clinton and Fairfield Bay was set to expire at 5:30 p.m. Saturday. Hail as large as 2 inches had been reported in north Arkansas, and hail the size of golf balls was reported at 5:08 p.m. Saturday as the storm moved into Stone and Cleburne counties. A severe weather warning was also issued for Mount Ida, Oden and Crystal Springs until 5:45 p.m. Saturday. The National Weather Service reported that the storm in that area could produce quarter-sized hail and 60 mph winds. The warnings followed a severe thunderstorm watch issued at around 4:15 p.m. Saturday. That covered most of southern Arkansas, the Central Arkansas area around Little Rock and a large portion of northeast Arkansas, and was set to expire at 10 p.m. Saturday. 3:50 p.m.: Hail reported in multiple Northwest Arkansas counties as storms move through state Hail was reported in Northwest Arkansas on Saturday afternoon as a line of severe storms moves through the state. At 3:34 p.m. Saturday, the National Weather Service reported hail the size of golf balls as the storms moved east-northeast from Pope County into Searcy County. That report followed one from the service shortly after 3 p.m. that hail stones of up to 2 inches had been reported in the Fort Smith area.  11:05 a.m.: Forecasters: Risk of severe weather for most of state on Saturday A line of severe storms that could produce high winds and large hail is in Arkansas' forecast Saturday evening, according to the National Weather Service.  The weather service has issued a severe thunderstorm watch for Northwest Arkansas and the River Valley until 7 p.m. Saturday. [WEATHER RADAR: Click here for updates » arkansasonline.com/radar] The storm front — which has a majority of the state under an enhanced risk of severe weather — could contain golf ball-sized hail and winds as strong as 80 mph, a severe weather briefing from the weather service in North Little Rock said. The National Weather Service defines an enhanced risk as several severe storms that could produce very large hail, damaging winds or a tornado, a tweet from the weather service said. "The primary hazards with these storms will be large hail and damaging winds; however, a tornado cannot be ruled out," the briefing said on Saturday morning.  According to the National Weather Service, the entire state has the potential to see large hail, but latest trends show these thunderstorms being most impactful across western and central Arkansas. In Central Arkansas, the area is forecast at having up to 44% chance of seeing hail. According to the weather service's modeling, the storms will start to develop around 4 p.m. and will begin forming into a line as they approach the Little Rock metro around 6 p.m.  By 7 p.m., the storms could form into an organized line stretching across the state. The forecast has the storms starting to leave the state around 9 p.m., the briefing said.  "Discrete cells that develop ahead of the main line of storms will have the potential to produce tornadoes," the briefing said.  Central and eastern Arkansas could see up to an inch and a half of rain as a result of the storm.

        Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Friday announced she had vetoed three bills and partially vetoed a fourth, objecting to measures ranging from the creation of a heart attack task force to stipend raises for members of a state board. The vetoes, which Sanders announced in letters addressed to the top lawmakers in the Arkansas Senate and House of Representatives, are the first the Republican governor has made since she was inaugurated Jan. 10. House Bill 1189, which aims to create a state-based license for behavior analysts, is among the bills Sanders vetoed in its entirety. Behavior analysts are professionals who help treat patients with mental and social disorders such as autism. In a letter, Sanders said the legislation "creates unnecessary and overburdensome regulation" for behavior analysts. The governor noted these professionals are already subject to regulation and certified by the Behavior Analyst Certification Board, a nonprofit corporation that provides certification on a national level. "Creating duplicative licenses with new fees attached is additional red tape that does not ensure additional protections for the public," Sanders said in the letter. The bill's sponsor, Rep. Nicole Clowney, D-Fayetteville, said on Friday she had worked on the legislation publicly for months without opposition from the governor. She noted the bill had received bipartisan support in both state chambers and was broadly backed by Arkansas behavior analysts. "At the end of the day, what I'm most disappointed by is that Arkansans who need protection won't get it," she said in an interview. [DOCUMENTS: Read three of the bills vetoed » arkansasonline.com/415hbsbveto/] Under the current certification system, Clowney said Arkansans have to bring complaints against certified behavior analysts to a board outside the state. "That national board is not serving Arkansans as well as an Arkansas board would," she said. The state license system would require analysts to undergo criminal background checks, which Clowney said is not a part of the national certification. She also said she was unaware of any state laws that require analysts to receive certification before practicing in Arkansas and noted the certification is not a license. She said that all states surrounding Arkansas require licenses for analysts. While Clowney said she does not plan to challenge the veto, she said she and other supporters still feel a fix is needed. HEART ATTACK TASK FORCE Sanders also vetoed House Bill 1622, which aims to create a heart attack task force, saying it would duplicate the Arkansas STEMI Advisory Council. The STEMI Advisory Council, which is overseen by the Arkansas Department of Health, was formed to tackle ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction, a type of heart attack. The voluntary panel consists of health care providers and public health professionals, according to the Department of Health's website. Rep. Andrew Collins, D-Little Rock, who sponsored House Bill 1622, said in an interview Friday that the veto was an unfortunate decision and represented a misunderstanding of what he intended to accomplish with the bill. The heart attack task force would not duplicate the STEMI Advisory Council. Rather the council would serve as the core of the task force, he said. Collins said he was disappointed Arkansans would not benefit from the positive impact he expected the task force would have in addressing the high rate of heart attack mortality in Arkansas. "It seems like a task force is a nonstarter for this governor regardless of what it does or how useful it is," he said. "That's the signal I'm getting from this veto." Collins said he did not plan to challenge the veto. [DOCUMENT: Read the full appropriations bill partially vetoed » arkansasonline.com/415hb1176/] STIPENDS Sanders vetoed Senate Bill 509, which would boost the maximum permitted daily stipend for members of the Arkansas Board of Corrections from $85 to $110. In a letter, Sanders said the increase "cannot be justified to Arkansas taxpayers." "As Governor, I made a commitment to the State of Arkansas that I would look for ways to reduce government waste and ensure that tax dollars are spent wisely," Sanders said. "Elected officials have a responsibility to eliminate unnecessary spending at every level of state government." Rep. Jack Fortner, R-Yellville, who sponsored the bill, said he was disappointed by the decision, noting the increase in his bill was minimal. Nevertheless, Fortner said he understood the stance Sanders has taken to reduce government. "Governor Sanders and I are good friends and have worked together all session," he said. "This will not affect our relationship." APPROPRIATION Sanders vetoed a section of House Bill 1176, advanced by the Joint Budget Committee, that would provide an appropriation of $5 million for pandemic-related expenses for the Arkansas Department of Corrections. "During my first days in office, I terminated several existing Executive Orders related to the COVID-19 pandemic," Sanders said in a letter. "I believe in freedom and personal responsibility – not COVID mandates or shutdowns. The COVID-19 pandemic is over." Sen. Jonathan Dismang, R-Beebe, said the section of the bill Sanders vetoed was an unfunded appropriation that would have no impact on the Department of Corrections. The vetoes send the bills back to the General Assembly where lawmakers may override Sanders' objections with a simple majority vote in both chambers. The Senate and House of Representatives voted April 7 to recess the regular session until May 1 or sooner.

        The sentencing of Richard "Bigo" Barnett in connection with the U.S. Capitol riot has been postponed from May 3 to May 24. U.S. District Judge Christopher R. Cooper filed an order Friday morning granting a motion from the defense to postpone Barnett's sentencing hearing. Federal prosecutors opposed the request. After a two-week trial in January, a jury in Washington, D.C., found Barnett guilty of eight charges in connection with the riot that occurred two years earlier, on Jan. 6, 2021. Barnett faced enhanced charges for carrying a stun gun into the Capitol, where he posed for photos with his foot on a desk in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office suite. Barnett faces a maximum penalty of 47 years in prison. Jonathan Gross, one of Barnett's attorneys, filed a motion Monday night saying a 107-page decision issued last week by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia "raises new issues that directly and specifically impact Mr. Barnett's case." Gross requested more time to "properly review and analyze the complicated decision" in United States v. Fischer and decide whether he needs to file supplements to Barnett's motions for acquittal or a new trial. In a filing Wednesday, federal prosecutors said, "No such continuance is justified." They argued that the appeals court decision in Fischer concerns defendants who "assaulted" police officers during the Capitol riot, and Barnett wasn't accused of assault. Regarding the Fischer decision, the prosecutors wrote, "The Circuit court confirmed that the government may charge individuals who allegedly assaulted law enforcement officers while participating in the Capitol riot with corruptly obstructing, influencing, or impeding an official proceeding, specifically Congress's certification of the Electoral College vote, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1512(c)(2). "The defendant -- who was not alleged to have assaulted law enforcement officers but who was convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. § 1512(c)(2) on a different theory -- asserts that the Fischer decision 'raises new issues that directly and specifically impact' his case but does not identify the issues or explain the impact." The Fischer decision doesn't affect Barnett's sentencing guidelines calculation or other sentencing factors, according to the prosecutors. Sentencing memoranda in the case are now due May 17.

        For the past two weeks, churches, nonprofits and other aid groups in Arkansas have adapted on the fly to meet the changing needs of hundreds of residents whose lives were upended by tornadoes. Now that survivors' immediate necessities have largely been met and the outpouring of donations and volunteers has started to subside, though, these leaders say their organizations must continue to adapt as Arkansans begin the lengthy, often exhausting process of rebuilding in the wake of a major disaster. For some of the people who were affected by the two EF3 tornadoes that swept through Pulaski and Cross counties on March 31, such efforts could take months or years. Some local groups who are providing aid, however, say they are committed to ensuring survivors continue to get support throughout the process, however long it takes. First Baptist Church in Jacksonville was among dozens of religious organizations, nonprofits and government agencies that quickly moved to offer aid to people affected by the tornadoes. Seth Tucker, senior pastor at First Baptist, was out of town when the tornado reached Jacksonville. One of the church's deacons called him to ask if their building could be opened up as a shelter. "The next morning, there's stuff being just left at the church," he said. First Baptist quickly became not only a shelter, but a source for hot meals and needed supplies. Donations began pouring in, along with other offers of help. Within a week, Tucker estimated the church had received at least $75,000 in donations of material goods, with an additional $10,000 in monetary donations. The donations, which ranged from clothing to bedding to hygiene supplies, quickly piled up on tables and along walls. In one room, clothes had even been draped across a piano. "The truth is, we didn't plan any of this," he said. Once the church started to fill up with donations, Tucker said members began writing posts on Facebook that emphasized what continued to be essential, rather than what was no longer needed. By Monday, the number of donations exceeded affected residents' demands. Church leaders stopped requesting donations on social media, and First Baptist has stopped accepting clothing. Tucker said the church plans to donate excess clothes to organizations that are better able to give them away, such as the Care Channel, also in Jacksonville. First Baptist will continue to store and distribute nonperishable food, diapers, hygiene products and other goods likely to remain necessary in the weeks after the tornado, according to the pastor. In Little Rock, similar aid was offered at the Immanuel Baptist Church City Center. Two days after the tornado struck, the site became a family assistance center in partnership with the city and other community organizations, providing food, water and other needed supplies. Officials and representatives were also at the site to address survivors' immediate financial and legal concerns. City officials provided identification for residents who lost theirs to the storm, while the state Division of Workforce Services had set up a trailer in the parking lot with officials supporting survivors with storm-related employment needs. Entergy Arkansas provided power-related assistance, and Federal Emergency Management Agency officials helped with insurance and Small Business Administration loans. By Monday, the City Center had served as many as 5,000 families, said Matt Hubbard, Immanuel Baptist Church's missions pastor and overseer of the site. The center already had an operating food pantry, clothes closet and dental clinic, so its staff already knew how to provide a number of services that are useful in disasters, and how to quickly scale such efforts. "We go from one to one thousand real quick," Hubbard said. Though donations were still coming in, the center had started to slow down its collection, according to the pastor. Like Tucker, the center's overseer acknowledged that clothing donations are often hard to deal with. "A comment we often give to donors is, 'Would you give this to your son or daughter to wear?'" Hubbard said. "We don't want to become a dumpster." The City Center has connected with other aid groups or local businesses to redirect excess items to places where they have a better chance of being used. Hubbard said that approach "still appreciates the donor" without interfering with the center's more critical operations. While the site continues to give away a lot of clothes, diapers and food, they shifted their donation collection to focus on what people who came to the center for aid said was most useful, such as baby formula and batteries. "We had to put ourselves in a position to say 'no' to what might be good but isn't best," Hubbard said. Even as some of the volunteers helping with supplies had been taking on similar efforts for 30 years, the City Center has had to learn about some of the residents' most critical needs "on the fly," Hubbard said. For instance, batteries were important for the thousands of people whose homes remained without power for days. Battery charging packs quickly became another critical item as they can significantly extend a battery's use. "We've adapted and responded as we've heard from people coming through the line," Hubbard said. Goodwill Industries of Arkansas President Brian Marsh explained that one of the reasons clothing donations can quickly build up is that people who have lost their houses don't immediately need much clothing because they have nowhere to put it. In addition to providing vouchers for those affected by the tornadoes, Goodwill has given transportation and storage support to the city of Little Rock and entities such as Walmart and Amazon that don't have the space to hold large volumes of donated resources. The nonprofit has also been in contact with the American Red Cross of Arkansas and tornado-affected communities across the state, and has been sending its staff to process donations at centers that don't have enough volunteers. While many aid groups accepted donations of material goods in the aftermath of the March 31 tornadoes, the Red Cross has been requesting that people give money. "The main thing we try to get is financial donations," organization spokesman Joe Zydlo said. "That's what really helps in situations like this." That money goes to providing financial assistance to families, setting up shelters and providing other comfort and care, added Josh Egbert, another Red Cross spokesman who was in Little Rock on Monday. "If someone gives us $100, we can get 20 blankets for someone," he said. "We can buy coffee, we can buy cots, we can buy these things that these people need and provide them with financial stability to start their recovery process." Heart of Arkansas United Way has also encouraged financial donations. "Donations of money are more helpful because they allow organizations that are on the ground to respond to the needs that they see on a daily basis," said Mollie Palmer, vice president of communication and engagement at the organization. Palmer said she has seen groups and companies partnered with United Way grapple with excess donations. Kimberly-Clark told them they had donations of wipes and feminine hygiene products. "Our first response to that, knowing the problem," she said, "is finding out if this is useful." Palmer said she thinks people want to do something generous in response to disasters, and they sometimes donate things "that aren't necessarily needed just yet." Furniture, for instance, is of limited immediate use to people whose homes have just been destroyed, according to the vice president. She encouraged people who want to make a material gift to "just ask what it is they might specifically need at the time." SHIFT TO LONG-TERM SUPPORT The City Center in Little Rock is in transition, re-assessing current needs and working to determine what will be needed in the months to come, Hubbard said. While the center will scale back some of its short-term efforts, such as collecting donations of lower priority items, they will also deploy to hard-hit areas to assess what longstanding assistance survivors will likely require. Hubbard said the center will have a better understanding of what those long-term needs will be once its teams connect with affected residents "on an individual level." In Jacksonville, First Baptist is moving from "disaster emergency" status into "recovery" mode. Tucker, the church's pastor, said they had seen a drop off in shelter residences, and that they were working to find permanent opportunities for those who remained without homes. In addition, many of the people who lost material goods have been able to acquire most of their needed food and clothing. Federal Emergency Management Agency representatives also remained in Jacksonville, according to Tucker. "It's organized," he said. "And we're trying to make it something more sustainable." The church has used donated money to get electricians to homes that were no longer connected to power, and to pay deposits for apartments for a couple of families, "and we're going to keep doing that," Tucker said. "That's the kind of thing that I think will last for months and months and months," he said. According to the pastor, these longstanding needs will become the church's emphasis. "This isn't a two-week mission trip," he said. Tucker described a friend who lost his home during Hurricane Harvey, which caused devastating flooding in Texas and Louisiana in 2017. The pastor said he asked his friend what he had needed after the storm, and that the man replied, "Everybody helps early, but when it was month four and I was sitting on a slab where my home used to be, no one was with me. And I needed someone there." The pastor said he wanted his church, and Christians in general, to be there for their cities when no one else is. That initial influx of donations and volunteers in the wake of a disaster, followed by a dip in both as time passes, is common, according to Marsh. "Everybody wants to be first to help," he said, but added that, in the days and weeks after the disaster, people often "get on with their lives." Because survivors' needs change over time, Goodwill began issuing vouchers that affected Arkansans can use to replace belongings lost in the storms when they are in ready to do so. The vouchers, which do not expire, can be redeemed for goods in any Goodwill retail store in the state. "Most people who have been displaced by the tornadoes are in immediate need of food, water and shelter," Marsh said in a release issued Monday. "It may be several days to weeks before they are in need of clothing and other household items. But when they are ready, these vouchers can be used anytime, at any location, for any item." Donations collected by the nonprofit are offsetting the vouchers, ensuring there's an ample supply of both vouchers and product, according to the president. Marsh said his nonprofit has been using vouchers in response to disasters in Arkansas since 2014, when a tornado that cut through Faulkner, Pulaski and White counties destroyed over 3,000 homes and killed 16 people. The Red Cross of Arkansas also emphasized its continued dedication to residents affected by the tornadoes. "[Donations] slowly start to drop off, but we want to remind people that we're going to be here for a while," Egbert said. "We're not going to just pack up and leave." This week, the Red Cross opened recovery centers for survivors, according to a news release from the organization. The centers are located at Calvary Baptist Church in Little Rock; the Bill Harmon Recreation Center in Sherwood; the Jacksonville Community Center and the Assembly of God Church in Wynne. Tornado response donations made to Heart of Arkansas United Way will go to the state's long-term recovery efforts, Palmer said. The money will continue to provide support after insurance companies and FEMA are done with their work, according to Palmer.

        A new website meant to be a "one-stop shop" for Arkansans looking for information about the state's education overhaul is now publicly available, Arkansas' education secretary said Friday. Education Secretary Jacob Oliva introduced the site during an Arkansas Board of Education work session at the state Capitol, during which the board also received an update on work groups that will develop recommendations for the LEARNS Act's rules and policies and discussed plans to update the state testing system. The session came one day after the board met at the Marvell-Elaine School District, during which they took control of the district and directed Oliva to explore entering into a "transformation contract" with a third party to operate the district. Oliva said in February that he anticipated the development of an information dashboard to keep the board and public up to date on LEARNS' implementation. The education secretary said one of the portal's goals is to help people "see how all these puzzle pieces" fit together by providing the information in one place. The mobile-friendly site can be visited at learns.ade.arkansas.gov. While he initially introduced the site, the agency's chief information officer, Arijit Sarkar, walked the board through its specific features. Sarkar said the agency quickly realized the portal needed to be that one-stop solution for not only the present, but for years to come. Included on the site are an overview of LEARNS, "transparency dashboards" with real-time statistics, details on work groups and a breakdown of action items and reports related to the law. The site also includes a section for education-related executive orders. The portal's home page displays the interactive dashboards, which are divided into three categories: enrollment range, school letter and ESSER. Below the dashboards are statistics about students, school districts and staff members. The home page also includes links to the text of Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders' executive order, which laid the groundwork for the education overhaul, and the text of the law itself, Act 237. During his presentation, Sarkar also highlighted the four tabs at the top of the site: The portal's "overview" page describes the goals of the law, and is broken into by the topics that make up the LEARNS acronym: literacy, empowerment, accountability, readiness, networking and safety. Each section of the overview describes the goal related to that topic, as well as the Education Department's commitments in those areas. The "accountability" section, for instance, says the law is intended to "reward good teachers with smart incentives, like higher pay," and that the agency is committed to "launch teacher residencies, waive initial licensing fees for first-time teachers, increase licensing transparency and efficiency and update workforce management provisions." The "executive orders" page provides a link to each of the listed executive orders, as well as summary reports and the ability to download the orders. The "action items" page, which is again organized by the LEARNS acronym, lists action items for each topic, along with due dates and, if the deadline has passed, related reports. The "reports" page also provides quick access to reports based on each of the action items. Board member Adrienne Woods, who expressed interest in how many students opt to private or home schooling under LEARNS, asked whether the portal would ever include information on private and home schoolers. Sarkar answered that the information could be integrated into the dashboard. Information about early education would also be available under the dashboard, Oliva said. However, he added that the transition to migrate that information "is a few months out." Ivy Pfeffer, deputy commissioner for the Education Department, also updated the board on the work groups being created for the purpose of developing recommendations for the overhaul's rules and policies. The agency received about 1,300 applications, with about 1,000 individuals submitting applications. According to Pfeffer, about 300 of the submissions were duplicate applications that may have come from people who applied for more than one group. The work groups will be divided by specific topics: school safety; early learning; parental empowerment; teaching and learning; educator workforce and career readiness, according to an earlier memo from the agency. The agency hopes to have work groups of about 10 people each, Pfeffer said. Stacy Smith, who is also a state deputy education commissioner, said that some topics, such as teaching and learning, will probably have several work groups formed "underneath that individual umbrella." Pfeffer said she anticipates the first work groups will be announced and get going in May. The workforce and parental empowerment groups are likely to be among the first to begin, according to the deputy commissioner. The rest of the groups will probably be formed during the summer, she said. Experts from different areas of education will likely be involved in the work groups as well, according to Pfeffer. She also said that education cooperatives are also being encouraged to create similar work groups to review the implementation process, as some aspects of LEARNS won't get underway until the 2025-26 school year. "This is something that's going to be ongoing for some time," she said. During the work session, Oliva also described the agency's efforts to revise the state's standards and the assessments used to measure how well these standards are met. "With the new standards we're writing out a new blueprint," Oliva said, adding that the blueprint would be shared with districts. Oliva highlighted a new state testing system for grades three through 10 that will replace the ACT Aspire in the 2023-24 school year, which will be developed by Cambium Assessment Incorporated, or CAI. CAI was selected from among six companies that responded to a request for proposals to help in developing the state-required tests in literacy, math and science. The Cambium choice was announced by Smith and Hope Worsham, state director for Elementary and Secondary Education Emergency Relief, in February 2022. The online Aspire tests are being discontinued after the 2022 and 2023 spring testing seasons by the ACT, which produces the college entrance exam. "Cambium is the vendor, but this is really going to be Arkansas having a say in their investment and customization for us," Smith said during the 2022 announcement. "The vendor has a lot of assessment questions that are aligned [to Arkansas academic content standards] but we really made it clear in the RFP -- because we really listened to teachers who said they wanted a say and 'we want to make sure the alignment pieces are there.'" During Friday's work session, Oliva said the Cambium-based assessment will ensure teachers have access to "real-time information" with which to make decisions about students' education, which he described as a priority for the agency.

         Three finalists presented their sculpture prototypes at the Clinton Presidential Center on Friday to have the chance to permanently take the place of a sapling from Anne Frank's chestnut tree that was dedicated in her memory in 2015 at the center. Because of Arkansas' climate, the tree did not survive. The selected sculpture will be centered around five 10-foot-tall etched glass panels. One is dedicated to Frank, one contains excerpts from President Bill Clinton's second inaugural address and the rest convey messages from three other violent, discriminatory acts -- the Indian Removal Act of 1830, the Central High crisis and the internment of Japanese Americans in Arkansas during World War II. The Sculpture at the River Market committee, the Clinton Foundation and the Sisterhood of the congregation of B'nai Israel will fund the artist's work and installation at an undecided location at the William J. Clinton Library and Museum. Stephanie Streett, executive director for the foundation, said this gives them an opportunity to have something physical that folks can see. "It also gives us a platform to bring in speakers to have dialogue, public conversations, student conversations; it's been really amazing and we've continued to do that even without the tree," she said. Donors for previous sculpture installations through the Sculpture at the River Market committee and other Little Rock community members visited with the artists and voted on which sculpture they thought should be selected. The winner will be announced this morning. Finalist Clay Enoch, a sculptor from Memphis, created a prototype titled "Indefatigable," which shows a couple bracing themselves for the impact of "catastrophic hatred and oppression." He said the pose "just kept grabbing me, something about the interaction between the couple, the expression, the emotion that it captures." "I hope it would bring someone in to think through some things but also if you're with someone, maybe it inspires a conversation," he added. "I think that's one of the things missing from our culture right now; there's not enough dialogue. Usually, we find out that we're more similar than different. If you really take the time to get to know someone and hear their story, instead of just kind of throwing bombs from social media, from behind a screen." Finalist Tim Smith, an artist from Kentucky, said he was inspired by his daughter's handwriting practice for his sculpture submission. "My daughter used to write cursive, to pretend, because she wasn't old enough yet. She was like 5 years old, but she was competing with her older brother, and she would tell herself stories," he said. "I was always intrigued, so I did a Sarah series that deals with this sort of gestural mark, and that's what I wanted to capture here. It's like you're sketching a tree in two seconds." Smith said his prototype sculpture represents seasonal changes, both outside and inside. The green twisting base of the sculpture winds through rectangular panels and is titled "A Space Within." Smith said he had been asking around what people thought of his design and a few said it shows hope. "I wanted that, but I hadn't expected them to say something like that," he added. "It is this idea of change and transform -- and part of me, what got me thinking about this is, I realized, I'm a classic white guy -- how can you compare with the legitimacy of their concerns?" Smith said the tree itself has a symbolic association with Anne Frank, but where it started was rocks, "under a mountainside, the sedimentary layers." "That shows the creation of the earth, those seeds of change, were fluid -- I've always been intrigued with this idea that what we think is permanent is really something in transition, and in the innocence of transformation to become -- it was so profound to those communities that were affected." Smith said it's about an "internal and external struggle" and how we respond. Finalist Joan Benefiel, a sculptor from Wichita, Kan., said this project is personal to her because her husband is Jewish. Her unnamed piece centers a "violently broken off" chestnut tree branch inside the five panels to symbolize the Holocaust with the top stemming branches blooming in silver. The sculpture would tower over a circular bench that is broken off for an entrance and fits a symbolic Jewish star of David and an American star inside. Benefiel said she wanted a way to incorporate the chestnut tree without it being a full tree because she thought it was important that the sculpture alludes to the fact that Little Rock received one of the 11 saplings from the original tree outside Frank's annex. "It's not hopeless, it's not dead, so it's sort of this unlikely discovery that it's still blooming, it has new life coming from it," she added. "That's the thing that most people associate Anne Frank is, is the hope that she maintained through that most dire, horrifying, [experience] for two years." Inscribed on the tree is a quote from Frank: "What is done cannot be undone, but one can prevent it from happening again." "It was very clear to me in this call, that it was important to acknowledge what's happened, but not just be done with saying, 'Well, we can still hope it doesn't happen again.' That's not good enough," Benefiel said. "You want to be actively working on making sure it doesn't happen again." Benefiel added that she wanted to create something that would be a learning tool and a place for people of all ages to discover something from. "What I really hope, it's a welcoming place, number one, it draws people in, it's of a scale that I think works in this outside environment," Benefiel said. "But what I hope will happen is someone comes in to read the text on the arc there and while they're there, you're reading that text, you're touching it, you're interacting with it, and then you look up at this bright new silver part, thinking about what that means. And what you're doing in that moment is you're standing and doing exactly what Anne did in her attic through her window." Benefiel believes this will spark empathy in visitors and allow them to talk about what that empathy means.  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        Honor Flight of the Ozarks has extended its reach into Arkansas to give more veterans a chance to see the memorials built in their honor in the nation's capital. Thirteen Arkansas counties -- Benton, Washington, Carroll, Madison, Newton, Boone, Marion, Searcy, Baxter, Stone, Fulton, Izard and Sharp -- were added to the Ozarks hub as were Oregon and Shannon counties in Missouri, according to a March news release from Honor Flight of the Ozarks. Honor Flight Network, a national organization, expanded the territory of Honor Flight of the Ozarks, according to the release. The hub previously had covered all of southwest Missouri, said Gary Ellison, a volunteer for Honor Flights of the Ozarks. "We believe there are a whole lot of veterans from Northwest Arkansas who have not gone on an Honor Flight," Ellison said. Jeff Miller and Earl Morse created the Honor Flight Network in 2005 with the simple mission of honoring the nation's veterans by bringing them to Washington, D.C., to visit the memorials built to commemorate their service and sacrifice. While initially focused on America's World War II veterans, Honor Flight Network has expanded its mission to include those who served during the Korean and Vietnam wars and veterans of any service era who are critically ill, according to the website honorflight.org. According to U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs statistics, 167,284 of the 16 million Americans who served in World War II were alive in 2022. Each Honor Flight takes a veteran and guardian on a daylong trip to Washington, D.C., to see the World War II Memorial, the Korean War Memorial, the Vietnam Memorial, the Lincoln Memorial, the Air Force Memorial, the Marine Corps Memorial and the Changing of the Guard at Arlington National Cemetery, according to the release. The Honor Flight Network is a national nonprofit organization composed of independent hubs that work together to achieve the Honor Flight mission, according to honorflight.org. The 124 hubs serve 44 states and have transported more than 260,000 veterans since the program started, according to the website. "It's a wonderful program that gives our veterans the chance to experience our nation's monuments that were erected in their honor," said Patrick Robinson, Benton County Veteran Services director. "Some of the veterans may have never experienced these monuments and would never have the opportunity without the Honor Flight program. "It also offers the camaraderie to travel and experience these monuments with fellow veterans that can relate to their military experiences. I've spoken with several veterans that have taken an Honor Flight. It's easy to tell that the experience is a very positive and emotional experience for the veterans." Ben Dykes, veteran services director for Washington County, said there are about 23,000 veterans in Benton County and 20,000 veterans in Washington County -- the second and third largest numbers in the state. Pulaski County has about 30,000 veterans, he said. Honor Flight of the Ozarks has taken more than 1,700 veterans to the nation's capital, Ellison said. It costs Honor Flight of the Ozarks $82,000 to rent a plane for each trip. Four charter buses are needed when in Washington, D.C. Eighty-one veterans go in each trip, he said. The group gets no government funding and uses fundraisers and donations to pay for the trips, he said. It's a long day as each group meets at the Springfield-Branson National Airport around 5:30 a.m. and returns to the airport around 10 p.m., Ellison said. Honor Flight of the Ozarks, which began operating in 2014, took three flights to Washington, D.C., last year after being grounded because of covid-19 in 2020 and 2021, Ellison said. The first flight for Honor Flight of the Ozarks set for May 17 is full, Ellison said. Other trips scheduled in August and September are mostly filled out, he said. There are vacancies for next year, and eligible veterans are urged to fill out an application, he said. Applications can be found online at www.HonorFlightoftheOzarks.org, according to the release.

         FAYETTEVILLE -- As the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville prepares to embark upon a national search for the next dean of the Sam M. Walton College of Business, the university has named an interim leader from within the college. Brent Williams will serve as interim dean starting Aug. 14, the same date current Dean Matthew Waller set for himself to step down and return to a faculty position as a professor of supply chain management. Waller, who took over as dean in the spring of 2016 after serving as interim dean since 2015, announced his plans early last month. The university announced the appointment of Williams on Friday. Williams, who received his Ph.D. in business administration -- with a concentration in supply chain management -- from UA-Fayetteville, is currently senior associate dean and Garrison Endowed Chair in Supply Chain Management in the Walton College, overseeing the business school's academic departments, student success initiatives and insights and analytics function, as well as leading Walton College's strategic planning process and several strategic initiatives, according to the university. He has chaired the department of supply chain management and led the early development of the McMillon Innovation Studio and Walton College in Little Rock. "I am energized by the opportunity to serve as interim dean," Williams said in a news release from the university. "I am grateful to Provost Terry Martin for his confidence in me and to Dean Matt Waller for his mentorship and support." Martin appointed Williams to the interim dean position and said in the news release that he's confident Williams "will continue the great work" Waller has started, "as well as continue to position Walton College as one of the best business schools in the country." In recent years, the Walton College of Business has received plaudits from U.S. News and World Report, including being named one of the "Best Business Schools" and having one of the "Best Undergraduate Business Programs," according to the university. Gartner Inc., cited the college for having the country's top undergraduate program in supply chain management in 2020 and 2022. In addition, The Princeton Review credited the university for having one of the top graduate entrepreneurship programs in the country this year, its first appearance in those rankings. It was ranked 35th among the 50 schools listed in the rankings, co-published in November by The Princeton Review and Entrepreneur magazine, and number five in the South region. Under Waller's leadership, Walton College has developed seven new master programs, established myriad endowments, and created four new online bachelor's degree programs. It's also led the way in the university's recent enrollment uptick, as it's up 600 students -- a far larger increase than any other school -- this year, to 2,417 students, according to Suzanne McCray, vice provost for enrollment and dean of admissions. Williams, who has also been on the faculty at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth and Auburn University in Alabama, has led research on how retail supply chains can develop and redesign planning and execution processes to meet the demands of today's changing marketplace, according to the university. He's also published more than 30 articles in several leading business journals. "I am incredibly proud of the accomplishments and growth we have achieved together at Walton College during my tenure as dean, [and] as I transition back to the faculty, I am confident that (Williams) will excel in his new role as interim dean," Waller said in the university's news release. "His extensive experience, dedication, and innovative spirit make him the ideal candidate to lead Walton College into the future, [and] I look forward to witnessing the continued success of our institution under his capable leadership."

        A 47-year-old Little Rock man linked to a 2017 home invasion where two people were shot and the fatal attempted ambush of an off-duty police officer one month later accepted a 25-year no-parole sentence on Friday. In exchange for the 25-year term imposed by Circuit Judge Karen Whatley, Kevin Lamont Pitts pleaded guilty to manslaughter, aggravated robbery, aggravated residential burglary, committing a terroristic act, two counts of first-degree battery and three counts of aggravated robbery for the two attacks about 2½ years apart. One of the links is the gun, deputy prosecutor Scott Duncan told the judge. Duncan said the same weapon was used in the January 2017 home-invasion robbery on Shadybrook Drive where husband and wife Latoria and Kwesi Montaque were shot that was used in the February 2017 robbery attempt on North Rodney Parham Road where Gregory Childers was killed trying to rob an off-duty Little Rock officer transporting state revenue funds. Duncan said Pitts, represented by attorneys Leslie Borgognoni and Camille Wright, could not qualify for parole as the result of a 1996 conviction for aggravated robbery, which means Pitts will not be eligible for early release until he is 68, given credit for time served since his arrest in July 2019. The 1996 case involved Pitts' participation at age 19 in the October 1995 armed holdup of a Little Rock convenience store on Cantrell Road that drew him a 12-year sentence. His co-defendant was sentenced to 10 years. According to police, the Montaque home was the subject of a pre-dawn raid that began when Latoria Montaque was accosted by a gunman when she was starting her car. When she started to go back inside, Montaque heard someone yell her name and when she turned back she saw a stranger rushing towards her, just as she was shot in the left hand. Montaque ran inside and locked the front door, screaming for her sleeping husband, Kwesi Montaque, as she heard glass breaking and more gunshots. The shooter broke out a window to get inside the house while Latoria Montaque climbed out a bathroom window to escape the home and ran to a neighbor's house to call for help. Kwesi Montaque, awakened by his wife's screams and gunshots, found an armed man in the living room. The robber demanded his money, guns, car keys and any drugs in the house. Kwesi Montaque said he was trying to give the robber what he wanted but that when the assailant turned away from him he went for the robber's gun. In the ensuing struggle, the .45-caliber pistol fired several times, wounding Montaque in the right shoulder. The robber got his gun back and left with Montaque's keys, wallet and cellphone, taking Latoria Montaque's 2012 Lexus with him. Investigators found the car about 11 hours later on Cobb Street with Pitts' blood on the steering wheel. His blood was also found at the couple's home on the broken window that the intruder used to get inside the house. About a month later and 6 miles from the Shadybrook home, a shirt covered in Pitts' blood was found in the passenger seat of a stolen sport utility vehicle that 44-year-old Gregory Lamont Childress had used to launch an attack on Angela Everett, an off-duty police detective who was transporting state monies while in uniform from the state revenue office in the Ashley Square shopping center to a bank. She was walking to her unmarked police car with the money when a Chevrolet Tahoe raced up, suddenly stopping to release a masked gunman. The robber demanded Everett give up the money, leading to a shootout that killed the robber, who turned out to be Childress. He had fired his .45-caliber pistol six times during the exchange of gunfire. The sports utility vehicle raced down Reservoir Road, with police finding the Tahoe abandoned about a half-mile away with the bloody shirt inside. Pitts was already a robbery suspect so detectives had him under surveillance with a tracker device on his car, and that tracker showed that his vehicle had been across the street from the shopping center and then in the center parking lot at the same time as the attack on Everett. Childress was on parole at the time from a 40-year-prison sentence for aggravated robbery he received at trial in September 1997 at age 25. He and his older brother, Jeff Childress Jr., had participated in the January 1995 carjacking of a Little Rock man on South Oak Street. The brothers were arrested 30 minutes later. Jeff Childress pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of robbery and was sentenced to five years of probation. Gregory Childress had been in trouble before that, court records show. In August 1990, an 18-year-old Childress and Malcolm Eugene Hodges, also 18, were involved in firing a sawed-off shotgun from their car through the windshield of a second vehicle, with the broken glass injuring a 4-year-old girl. Both teenagers received probation after pleading guilty to second-degree battery and aggravated assault a couple of months later. A 16-year-old boy was also charged but his record has been expunged. In May 1993, Childress' brother, 17-year-old Durrell Ray Childress, shot and killed an off-duty Little Rock police officer, 62-year-old Henry Callanan, while trying to rob Callanan at a McDonald's on West Roosevelt Road. Callanan was taking the restaurant's cash to the bank. Durrell Childress was convicted of capital murder and aggravated robbery, receiving a life sentence from a Pulaski County jury the next year. In September 2020, Durrell Childress' sentence was converted to a 20-year prison term after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that barred no-parole life sentences for juvenile offenders. The reduced sentence made Childress immediately eligible for release.  Print Headline: Man gets 25-year term for two 17 shootings Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         Dear Mahatma: A whole bunch of people are moving here from California. Did you know that? They sell their houses for a lot of money there, and buy in Arkansas for a lot less. Ask anyone in real estate. -- Anecdotal Evidence Dear Anecdotal: Way back when, in a previous century, this newspaper would use cost of living data to persuade journalists to leave their squalid coastal cities and come to beautiful Arkansas. The data was compelling to many. Not to mention all the trees, mountains, lakes, streams and other wonders we have in the Natural State. It's tough to go back to Philadelphia after a visit to the Buffalo River or Petit Jean State Park. What does this have to do with traffic, or driving, or highway construction? Ha! We asked the Department Finance and Administration, of which the Office of Driver Services handles driver's license transfers, for data from 2022. We learned that a total of 53,519 people transferred their licenses from other states to Arkansas. A breakdown of the top 10 transfers turned out this way: 1. Texas: 9,441. 2. California: 5,234. 3. Oklahoma: 3,305. 4. Florida: 2,840. 5. Tennessee: 2,427. 6. Louisiana: 2,265. 7. Colorado: 1,953. 8. Arizona: 1,773. 9. Illinois: 1,698. 10. Mississippi: 1,446. Way lower on the list was Rhode Island, with 39 transfers, a mere 25 from the District of Columbia, 210 from Alaska and 144 from Hawaii. Please allow us to analyze (that is, speculate wildly and without corroborating information) these numbers. We deduce that of course our neighboring states of Texas, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Louisiana would account for many transfers. So many from Texas -- we reckon there are an equal or much greater number of Arkansans moving to Texas. This trend has persisted since the early 19th century, when Arkansans and people from other states would carve into their doors and fences the letters GTT -- Gone to Texas. But California? Not exactly a neighboring state. Light is shed by data from the Missouri Economic Research and Information Center, which tells us that Arkansas is the 11th-cheapest state in which to live, with a composite score of 90.6, 100 being average. Mississippi, the cheapest, is at 85.0. California checks in at 49th, at 137.6. What goes around comes around. The Dust Bowl and Great Depression saw a wave of migration from Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri and other states to California. These poor folks, no matter from which state, were generally known as Okies and Arkies. Have the prodigals returned? Dear Mahatma: For your expired hall of fame license plates. Seen at Walmart on Arkansas 10. -- Robert Dear Robert: Thanks for sending the photo of a Honda with a temporary plate dated June 23, 2021, about 10 dog years ago. Continued use of this plate suggests the driver hasn't paid his 6.5% state sales tax on the vehicle. Although the vast, vast majority of others have.

        100 years ago April 15, 1923 PINE BLUFF — The Lincoln County Bank of Star City filed suit in Chancery Court here today, against K. L. Fish and E. C. Norton, formerly cashier and assistant cashier respectively of the bank, for the recovery of $16,992.50, which according to the complaint, the defendants wrongfully withdrew and appropriated to their own use. It is charged that the money was taken from the bank while the defendants were cashier and assistant cashier, and its withdrawal concealed from the directors of the bank. … The discrepancy was not discovered by the directors of the bank until the latter part of 1922. 50 years ago April 15, 1973 BENTONVILLE — Two escapees from a Muskogee, Okla., jail were captured by State Police near here Saturday night, but a third escapee remained at large. A State Police spokesman said Trooper Keith Ferguson apprehended the two after a high speed chase on U.S. Highway 71 north of here, in which several shots were fired at the troopers car. … Washington County police also suspect two of the escapees robbed a grocery near Fayetteville earlier Saturday, taking $1,000 from the store and four customers. 25 years ago April 15, 1998 Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., sidestepping a class-action lawsuit, must offer free trials of such services as Caller ID to 6 million customers in Arkansas and four other states. The trials are part of a settlement of a lawsuit filed in St. Louis by a group of customers who alleged that Southwestern Bell misrepresented its In-Line and InLine Plus home and business telephone repair services to customers. Although Southwestern Bell agreed to the settlement, approved Dec. 3, the company did not admit to any wrongdoing, said Michael Slatin, a company spokesman. The states involved are Arkansas, Missouri, Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas. … The proposed settlement will give current and former customers of Southwestern Bell Wireless Inc. and its sister company, Cellular One, $15 credit vouchers that can be applied to merchandise at the companies retail stores. The vouchers can also be used for new or renewal service contracts, or additional service. 10 years ago April 15, 2013 A bill approved Wednesday by the Arkansas Legislature will open the door for the General Education Development test, which has long been paid for by the state, to cost students as much as $120. Act 1063, which was introduced March 11 as House Bill 2201, grants the Department of Career Education the authority to determine fees for the test, which must then be approved by the State Board of Career Education. Though the department has paid the existing $20.46 cost of the test, the act allows the department to charge students the higher cost of the GED Testing Services examination beginning Jan. 1, 2014, when the nationwide program is scheduled to shift from pencil-and-paper format to computer-based system.

         FAYETTEVILLE -- Graffiti becomes street art when the property owner welcomes it. Fayetteville hopes to encourage street artists by setting up a sanctioned surface for spray paint art at a defunct pump station already prone to graffiti. A community art wall is planned on Poplar Street southeast of the intersection with Chestnut Avenue, near the Razorback Greenway. The spot is a grassy piece of city right of way on which a decommissioned wastewater pumping station sits. The idea came after City Council member Teresa Turk proposed starting a graffiti abatement program in December. The proposal has undergone some revisions after discussion among council members and members of the city's resident-led Arts Council. The proposal has appeared on the City Council's agenda four times and will again be on the agenda for Tuesday's meeting. The Arts Council suggested providing a sanctioned space for street artists to express themselves as an alternative to painting surfaces illegally. Joanna Bell, the city's arts and culture director, set about finding a suitable place. The plan is to try a six-month pilot program, likely in place by fall, she said. The Arts Council approved using $10,000 out of the city's arts and culture budget to put toward the project. The budget may increase depending on whether the city receives grants for programming, Bell said. If awarded, the City Council would have to approve the grant amount to receive the money. Artists would be able to paint the pump structure itself, along with a couple temporary walls on stilts, Bell said. The walls would be on stilts because the grass sits in a floodplain, she said. The site would go largely self-regulated, Bell said. A sign would outline codes of conduct such as not leaving spray paint cans or litter behind, only painting the sanctioned surfaces and refraining from painting hate speech, she said. "Our hope is that we encourage creative expression in a way that's a little more out in the open and a little more vibrant and results in something that feels a little more welcoming," Bell said. Potential programming may include trucks serving some kind of food or refreshments from a gravel driveway at the site or workshops led by local artists. It can be difficult for aspiring artists to learn how to make public art, said Olivia Trimble, a local artist with a background in sign painting who is frequently commissioned for public art pieces. The best way to learn is through experience and having guidance along the way can be immensely helpful, she said. The region lacks formal training in public art, so any workshops the city could host at the space would go a long way in helping artists hone their skills, Trimble said. Providing a sanctioned space for street artists to practice their craft likely would cut down on the amount of graffiti illegally placed on public or private property by providing an outlet for expression, she said. Communities in other cities typically do a good job of controlling their own sanctioned art spaces, Trimble said. If someone paints something that people may find offensive, local artists usually quickly go to work to paint something else over it, she said. "I just think it will go toward giving more depth and dimension to our arts community, which is rapidly growing and changing," Trimble said. "We want those more interesting, deeper, sometimes complicated components." Sanctioned spaces for graffiti-style artwork are commonplace in the United States and elsewhere. Matador Network, a travel and tourism destination website, lists a few. The Plaza District in Oklahoma City turned a once crime-addled alley into a place for rotating artists to show their work, according to Matador. Different artists paint walls near 16th Street and Indiana Avenue on a monthly basis, giving visitors a reason to come back regularly. The Deep Ellum arts district in Dallas has turned more than 8,000 square feet of wall into artwork for passersby to enjoy. The 42 murals project there in 2012 had local artists paint more walls in the district, which serves as home to live music venues, shops and restaurants. Atlanta has several sanctioned spaces for street art throughout the city. The BeltLine Eastside Trail is particularly known for its dozen or so pieces along a pedestrian-only pathway. The continually changing walls serve as a frequent attraction for visitors, according to Matador. Fayetteville's project aligns with the gathering and place-making goals set out in the city's newly adopted parks and recreation master plan, said Alison Jumper, the city's director of parks, natural resources and cultural affairs. Participants in surveys that helped shape the plan ranked creating places with focused activities highly among priorities for parks, she said. The project also touches on some other goals in the plan, such as taking advantage of under-used city-owned spaces and treating trails as a sort of linear park, Jumper said. "It kind of creates this node where people can hang out, spend time together, enjoy art, participate in art and also have more of a respite along the trail," she said. Sonia Harvey, a member of the City Council and the Arts Council, said she remembered talking about the possibility of creating a sanctioned community art wall when the city developed its Fayetteville Forward economic plan in 2009. The idea seems like a no-brainer for the city, she said. Harvey said she thought of the project like an outdoor art gallery. She said she hopes the project will encourage street artists who otherwise may operate under cover of darkness to come out and show off their skills in a way that benefits the community. "For the people who have a true talent for this type of art form, we'll be able to see who they are, what they do and what they're capable of doing, and say, 'Yeah, knock yourselves out. Go do something amazing,'" Harvey said. [https://bit.ly/matadorstreetart]  Print Headline: Sanctioned street art considered again Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        The city of Little Rock will waive all permitting fees in areas affected by the March 31 tornado that hit the metro area, Little Rock Planning and Development Director Jamie Collins announced at a City Hall news conference Friday. Officials have designated a zone of eligibility for waived fees that contains the tornados path, along with a half-mile buffer around it, Collins said. Additional staff have been assigned “as needed” for permitting and inspections, he said.  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        A Saline County man convicted last year of heading up a cocaine distribution conspiracy in Central Arkansas was sentenced to 35 years in federal prison this week. On Thursday afternoon, U.S. District Judge Brian Miller sentenced OC Rawls, 50, of Benton, to 420 months' imprisonment. Rawls was indicted in late 2019 along with five other people after a five-month investigation conducted by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration utilizing controlled narcotics buys, covert surveillance and wiretaps that prosecutors said implicated Rawls and several other people in cocaine trafficking in Central Arkansas. Investigators began looking into the drug-trafficking activities of Rawls and several others beginning in January of 2019. Using a confidential informant, DEA agents made three controlled purchases of cocaine from Rawls. During the investigation, agents learned that Rawls and other members of his drug trafficking organization were traveling to Houston, Texas, to purchase kilogram quantities of cocaine for redistribution in the central-Arkansas area. In May 2019, agents executed search warrants at Rawls' residence and the residences of several co-conspirators, confiscating cocaine, marijuana, firearms, ammunition, and approximately $19,000 in cash. A federal grand jury handed up an indictment in November 2019 charging Rawls with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and crack cocaine, and three counts of possession with intent to distribute and distribution of cocaine. He was convicted of the charges following a two-day jury trial in July 2022. Four of his co-defendants, including Rawls' brother, Tauji Laewon Rawls, 47, pleaded guilty to charges ranging from felon in possession of a firearm to conspiracy to distribute cocaine and have been sentenced to prison. Tauji Rawls pleaded guilty July 20, 2022, to one count of felon in possession of firearms and was sentenced to time served and three years supervised release last September. Kevion Littlejohn pleaded guilty June 1, 2022, to one count of conspiracy to distribute cocaine and was sentenced last September to 78 months in prison. Shonquelous Burnett pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute cocaine June 4, 2021 and was sentenced to 46 months in prison in October 2021. Kenneth Johnson pleaded guilty October 30, 2020, and was sentenced to 12 months and 1 day in prison in May 2021. A fifth co-defendant, Bobby "Bird" Burks, is missing and considered a fugitive. Rawls has a prior federal criminal conviction for possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute, for which he received 150 months' imprisonment in 2006. Because of the prior conviction Rawls' minimum sentence on the conspiracy count was increased from 10 years to 15 years and the minimum term of supervised release was increased from five years to 10 years. In addition to the 35-year prison sentence, Judge Miller sentenced Rawls to serve ten years of supervised release following imprisonment and to pay a $400 special assessment. Following the hearing, Rawls was remanded back into the custody of U.S. marshals to await transport to prison.

        <font size="4.4" face="arial" color="black">
         Toward the end of Thursday's Watson Chapel School District board meeting, Superintendent Tom Wilson announced some good news that wasn't. Wilson said he was informed Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed Senate Bill 355, which would have delayed the requirement for new campuses to add storm shelters to Jan. 1, 2025. Wilson found out after the meeting that wasn't the case, going from excitement to original disappointment when he informed the public earlier in the meeting the unsigned bill would result in an extra expense in the district's high school building project. The district has yet to start constructing a new high school, toward which patrons voted for a 5.7-mill increase to 39.8 last August. Watson Chapel, however, along with other districts in similar positions, have faced rising construction costs, meaning the $23 million set aside from state partnership and local millage funding a 92,500-square foot campus is not enough. The district projects about $39.48 million will be needed to cover the entire project cost due to the inflation in building material costs, a far cry from the $17.25 million the Arkansas Department of Education approved the district (for a then-estimated $23 million campus) in December 2021. In a presentation given Thursday, Wilson broke down funding sources for the $39.48 million: $15 million in state partnership funds $8 million in local millage funding $4 million in second-lien bonds $6 million from the district building fund $6.48 in additional funding for facilities, if approved by the Education Department's facility department by May 1. A storm shelter will cost the district anywhere from $3.5 million to $4 million to house secondary school students and about $8 million to house all the district's students, Wilson estimated. The WCSD could apply for financial assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Wilson said. "We should be able to get in line and get money to build a safe room, and we have to pay 25% of that," Wilson said. "They [FEMA] pay 75. That would be huge for the district." The uncertainty in when construction will begin likely changes the projected opening date for the high school from February 2025 to the following fall. The district hopes to approve a final building plan by May 15 of this year and send those plans to state officials for approval by July 25. DISTRICT PLANS RECONFIGURATION In hopes of starting construction soon, the WCSD released its reconfiguration plan of grade levels, which officials say must be submitted to the Education Department by June 1 for approval. Under the proposed plan: Children in grades K-2 will attend Edgewood Elementary (presently K-1) Children in grades 3-6 will attend Coleman Elementary (presently 4-6) Children in grades 7-8 and pre-kindergarten will attend the L.L. Owen Elementary campus (presently 2-3) And freshmen through seniors will attend Watson Chapel High. L.L. Owen was chosen as a temporary junior high campus because of its proximity to the high school for activities, Wilson said. John Hayden, executive director of support services, said pre-kindergartners will be separated from the junior high students, and added the construction partnership with the ADE requires the district to place freshmen at the high school. That will increase the number of students on that campus to 666, as the school has housed as many as 750 students, Hayden added. MONEY TALK A new salary schedule that reflects the state-mandated increase in minimum teacher salary, regardless of degree attained, to $50,000 was passed during Thursday's board meeting. The Arkansas LEARNS Act, which Governor Sanders championed and signed into law March 8, provides for the increase, as well as a minimum $2,000 bump in each salary of $48,000 or more. The new salaries, which go into effect for the 2023-24 school year, are based on a 190-day teacher contract and does not provide additional funding for those on extended contracts. As a result, the WCSD board voted compensate those teachers by taking $2,000 and dividing it by 190, then multiplying the quotient by the number of days in an extended contract to figure the amount to add to the base salary. Board members voted to table a motion that would have authorized Wilson to reject a change in faculty and staff pay frequency from once per month to twice to next spring. Frankie Hemphill of the Watson Chapel High Personnel Policy Committee suggested to board members for months to consider twice-monthly pay, but Wilson contended that to do so would lead to extra costs for the district, citing consultation. "Personally, I'd rather them table it than to vote it down," Hemphill said. "Although I would have rather them voted for it, to have tabled it is fine for me for next year. What I don't like is that you have some people who don't understand what it's like, as board member [Connie] Compton said, to have a one-paycheck household. They need that every two weeks. I remember what it was like in my younger years when I started teaching. That once-a-month was a killer, but twice a month would have been better." WILDCAT WARRIORS Members of the district's Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps were honored as Wildcat Warriors for April: Jyria Williams placed first in drill competitions in the state and she leads her JROTC company, comprised 95% eighth-graders. MaKayla Earl placed first in the new cadet drill competition in the state and was the top female physical fitness competitor. She is said to always be one of the best platoon sergeants in the school's JROTC. Haywood King has been a Cadet of the Quarter as a Let 1 cadet and was part of the New Cadet Drill Team that won its third state championship in a row. His platoon finished third overall. Destiny Hines has been a Cadet of the Quarter as a Let 2 cadet and was drill commander of the first-place unarmed exhibition drill team in state. Chelsea Grigsby is a member of the unarmed drill team that was second in drill competitions and is said to be one of the best sergeants in the school JROTC. Instructors Darryle Small and Sgt. Jimmy Stocker lead the Watson Chapel JROTC. Small and choral music instructor Janet Johnson were named Employees of the Month. PERSONNEL MOVES The district accepted letters of retirement from custodian Williestine Bates and district nurse Rose Sullivent, as well as resignations from elementary teacher Stephanie Hayslip, nurse Michelle Jefferson and Edgewood Elementary Principal Annette Neely.

        Belinda Hendrix, who has coached three softball teams to National Junior College Athletic Association Division I championships, will launch the Southeast Arkansas College softball program as its first head coach, the Pine Bluff school announced Friday.  Hendrix, 47, is also the second head coach in Southeast Arkansas Colleges nascent athletic history, following athletic director and mens basketball leader Chad Kline. Hendrix coached 17 seasons at Chipola College in Florida, leading the Indians to NJCAA Division I championships in 2007, 2015 and 2019. Six of her teams have won championships in the NJCAA's Region 8, which covers Florida, and shes been Coach of the Year in that region six times. In addition, Hendrix won 10 Florida Panhandle Conference titles and was named Coach of the Year in that league 10 times. “I am honored and excited to join the SEARK family as the womens softball head coach,” Hendrix said in a news release. “I look forward to building a program that reflects the core values of SEARK and developing student-athletes who are successful both on and off the field. Together, we will work towards achieving great things and creating a legacy of excellence.” Hendrix said earlier this week that Chipola is similar to Southeast Arkansas College in terms of size, and that Hendrix recruits players who are “serious” about softball and academics and who have something to prove. Hendrix has a 723-187 career collegiate record, has coached more than 50 NJCAA All-Americans, and has graduated 90% of her student-athletes. She left Chipola for East Tennessee State University in July 2021, but she was fired from that job in November. Hendrix earned an associates degree from Thomas University in Georgia and a bachelor of science degree from Troy University in Alabama. She began her career in the Florida panhandle at Vernon High School in 2001. She was selected over Cecilia Kolesar, assistant coach at the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff. “We are thrilled to have Belinda Hendrix join the SEARK family,” Southeast Arkansas President Steven Bloomberg said. “Her experience and accomplishments speak for themselves, and we believe she will be an exceptional addition to our athletics program. We look forward to seeing the impact she will have on our student-athletes and the SEARK community.” Added Kline: “Belinda Hendrix is an outstanding coach who has achieved numerous milestones in her career. We are confident that she will continue to develop and inspire our student-athletes, as well as elevate the softball program to new heights.” Kline said the college will hold off on announcing its head baseball coach at least until Monday. Georgia Highlands College assistant Tucker Hughes and Steven Adams Jr., Eastern Kentucky University's director of baseball operations, are the finalists for that position.

        Walmart Inc.s chief merchandising officer will leave the company at the end of May, Walmart said Friday. John Furner, president and chief executive of Walmart U.S., said in a memo to employees that Charles Redfield will serve through the end of April but stay on through May in an advisory role. Furner said Redfield will “begin a new chapter in June spending more time with family.” The company will release information about Redfields successor soon, Furner said. Redfield is a 32-year Walmart veteran, but just moved into his current job in January 2022. Starting as a cashier at Sams Club while a student at the University of Arkansas, Redfield was brought on full time after graduating. After serving in a number of leadership roles in operations and merchandising, he was named chief merchandising officer for Asda, Walmarts U.K. subsidiary, in 2010. Redfield returned to the United States in 2012 to serve as executive vice president of merchandising at Sams Club. In 2015, he was named executive vice president of food at Walmart U.S., a role he held until becoming chief merchandising officer in 2022. Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        The city of Little Rock will waive all permitting fees in areas affected by the March 31 tornado that hit the metro area, Little Rock Planning and Development Director Jamie Collins announced at a City Hall news conference Friday. Officials have designated a zone of eligibility for waived fees comprised of the tornado's path, along with a half-mile buffer around it, Collins said. Additional staff have been assigned "as needed" for permitting and inspections, he said.   Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        The sentencing of Richard "Bigo" Barnett of Gravette has been postponed from May 3 to May 24. U.S. District Judge Christopher R. Cooper filed an order this morning granting a motion from the defense to postpone Barnett's sentencing hearing. Federal prosecutors opposed the request. After a two-week trial in January, a jury in Washington, D.C., found Barnett guilty of eight charges in connection with the U.S. Capitol riot of Jan. 6, 2021. Barnett faced enhanced charges for carrying a stun gun into the Capitol, where he posed for photos with his foot on a desk in then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosis office suite. Barnett faces a maximum penalty of 47 years in prison. Sentencing memoranda in the case are now due May 17. Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        With no fanfare in this year's regular session, the Legislature repealed an 8-year-old state law barring a candidate or public official from displaying one or more campaign banners, campaign signs or other campaign literature larger than 12 inches by 12 inches on a vehicle belonging to the candidate or public official while on state Capitol grounds. Three former candidates for state-elected offices have challenged the constitutionality of the law in Pulaski County circuit court. Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed House Bill 1600 by Rep. David Ray, R-Maumelle, on April 4, according to records in the secretary of state's office. The bill is now Act 456 of 2023. It will become effective 90 days after the Legislature adjourns its regular session. The Legislature may adjourn May 1 or sooner. The state law barring a candidate or public official from displaying one or more campaign banners, campaign signs or other campaign literature larger than 12 inches by 12 inches on a vehicle belonging to the candidate or public official while on state Capitol grounds was enacted as part of Act 1280 of 2015, sponsored by then-state Sen. Jon Woods, R-Springdale. Before Act 1280 of 2015 was enacted into state law, then-state Sen. David Burnett, D-Osceola, said the provision would require some vehicles parked at the state Capitol that were extensively painted to get a new paint job and he wondered what the purpose of it was since it appeared aimed at a few constitutional officers, including then-state Treasurer Dennis Milligan, a Republican from Benton. At that time, Woods replied that the state Capitol grounds are "a place for policy, conducting the people's business and not a campaign [area]." Ray said Thursday he introduced House Bill 1600 to repeal the law because he became aware of the law through media accounts of various ethics complaints as well as conversations with colleagues about it, and "it seemed like a ridiculous prohibition, since nobody gets elected because they had a magnet on their car at the Capitol." "It's not as if it's some sort of moral or ethical failing to have a magnet on your car," he said in a written statement. "In fact, it's no different substantively than having a bumper sticker on your car. Why is an 11" sign permissible under the law but a 13" sign illegal? [In] my opinion, the law was arbitrary and capricious. It also seemed like a violation of someone's 1st Amendment right to freedom of speech. Why can you hold a political rally on the steps of the Capitol but you can't have a political sign on your personal vehicle? Our Founding Fathers wanted to protect political speech above almost everything else, so why would we have this silly prohibition?" Ray said he asked others if they knew why the law was in place and "I received a few different variations on the story, but every version basically boiled down to the fact that a lawmaker was mad at some other office holder, and this was their method of getting back at them. "That's simply a bad way to make policy," he said. In May, lawyers and then-Republican state House candidates Chris Corbitt of Conway and Robert Steinbuch of Little Rock petitioned Pulaski County Circuit Court Judge Herbert Wright to strike down Arkansas Code Annotated 7-1-114 as a violation of free speech protections guaranteed by the state and federal constitutions. They filed suit against the state of Arkansas and then-Gov. Asa Hutchinson. On June 29, the complaint was amended adding unsuccessful Republican Secretary of State candidate Eddie Joe Williams of Cabot as a plaintiff after Corbitt and Steinbuch lost in the May 24 Republican primaries for state House seats. The amended complaint was filed against the state of Arkansas, Hutchinson, Secretary of State John Thurston and Ethics Commission Director Graham Sloan. In July, then-Attorney General Leslie Rutledge asked Wright to dismiss the claims against the defendants in the lawsuit. In December, Williams agreed to pay a $75 fine and receive a public letter of caution in a settlement in which he agreed with a finding by the ethics commission that he violated Arkansas Code Annotated 7-1-114 during the 2022 election cycle by displaying one or more campaign banners, campaign signs or other literature larger than 12 inches by 12 inches on his vehicle while on the state Capitol grounds. In a court filing March 13, Republican Attorney General Tim Griffin said Wright should dismiss the amended complaint filed by Corbitt, Steinbuch and Williams. In a court filing March 30, Corbitt, Steinbuch and Williams disagreed with Griffin. Wright hasn't yet issued a ruling in the case, according to Pulaski County's circuit court records. House Bill 1600 was introduced March 10, and the House voted 72-6 to approve it March 16 and the Senate voted 29-1 to approve it March 29, according to the General Assembly's website. Ray, who worked for Griffin in the lieutenant governor's office and served as campaign manager for Griffin's attorney general campaign, said Thursday neither Steinbuch, Corbitt nor Williams contacted him before he filed his House Bill 1600. He said "I did ask the Attorney General what his opinion of the law was and he agreed that it was constitutionally dubious." Griffin said Thursday "I have always thought the law is asinine and potentially violates the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, so I was excited to learn that Rep. Ray was seeking to repeal the law. "Regarding the cases currently being handled by my office, I am considering all of my options," he said. Steinbuch said Thursday "it seems clear that the Legislature was aware of our suit and saw fit to repeal the unconstitutional law before the courts did. "We're genuinely appreciative of the course correction," he said. In December, then-state Rep. Fred Love, D-Little Rock, agreed to be fined $75 by the Arkansas Ethics Commission in a settlement in which he agreed he violated Arkansas Code Annotated 7-1-114 as a candidate for a state Senate seat during last year's election cycle by displaying one or more campaign banners, campaign signs or other literature larger than 12 inches by 12 inches on a vehicle belonging to him while on the state Capitol grounds. As a state senator, Love voted present on House Bill 1600. He said Thursday he was fined for violating state law and didn't want to weigh in about repealing that law, but that he's not surprised the law was repealed.

        Arkansas bankers are using innovative methods to detect and prevent check fraud, which has zoomed up 143% in the state and 165% nationwide over the past three years. Fraud is being fueled by an escalation of blue-box mail thefts and robberies of postal carriers, creating losses that amount to nearly $19 billion annually for the nation's financial sector. The crisis led the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), part of the U.S. Treasury Department, to issue an alert in February urging financial institutions to step up efforts to battle counterfeit checks. Sophisticated forgery operations rely on mail-related thefts to drive the escalation in check fraud, according to Steve Vogt, director of fraud operations at Simmons Bank of Pine Bluff. "There has definitely been an upswing across the industry," Vogt said. The U.S. Postal Inspection Service reports dramatic increases in theft from postal service collection boxes, up 65% from 2020-22, and a 388% jump in robberies of postal carriers from 2019 through the first quarter of this year. In February, a federal sting operation led to the arrests of three North Little Rock residents who were charged with theft from post-office locations. Law enforcement estimated at the time there were more than 700 victims of mail theft and forgery related to the investigation. Postal theft is the primary vehicle to steal checks, according to the FinCEN alert. "Criminals committing mail theft-related check fraud generally target the U.S. Mail in order to steal personal checks, business checks, tax refund checks, and checks related to government assistance programs, such as Social Security payments and unemployment benefits," the alert said. "Criminals will generally steal all types of checks in the U.S. Mail as part of a mail theft scheme, but business checks may be more valuable because business accounts are often well-funded and it may take longer for the victim to notice the fraud." FinCEN's alert reported that fraud claims filed by U.S. banks almost doubled to 680,000 from 350,000 in 2021, which was up 23% over the number of check fraud-related reports filed in 2020. Check fraud in Arkansas rose 143% from 2020-22, according to FinCEN data. There were 1,044 incidents reported in 2020, 1,273 in 2021 and 2,536 last year, and cases were recorded in every Arkansas county. The FBI estimates annual losses for the financial industry at nearly $19 billion and the Better Business Bureau reports the average counterfeit-check or money-order scam leads to losses of $1,500 per item. Trade organizations such as the American Bankers Association work with members to help detect and prevent fraud through the sharing of best practices. "The rise in sophisticated check fraud is a serious issue, and ABA is working collaboratively with our members and other stakeholders to implement innovative solutions that target the real problem -- the bad actors preying on customers and the banks that serve them," said Sarah Grano, spokesperson for the industry association. "Working together as an industry, alongside law enforcement, the Postal Service and regulators, offers us the best chance at success." Banks are shy about discussing specific security measures though several industry officials noted the sector has ramped up investments in technology, including the use of artificial intelligence to build robust fraud-detection systems. For example, vendors are now offering the ability to auto-match signatures and flag them when they differ from historical averages. The quality of the systems has significantly increased in the past couple of years, officials say. The industry has advanced technology to better identify fake check stock using better imaging technologies that can see the micro-print and other features available in official check stock. Vogt notes that criminal activity has become more sophisticated, moving from "check washing" to development of an online market to trade in stolen checks. Washing checks involves replacing the payee information with a new name or fraudulent identities or with business accounts that criminals control. Illegal markets now involve the buying and selling of bulk stolen checks and forgers use those to re-create an exact image of the looted checks. "Once the image is out there, the bad guys can take check stock and create an exact replica of a check that looks really, really good," Vogt added. "That's causing a major problem -- but it's really the market over the web that's creating a bigger problem because checks are so accessible. They get a good image of the check and it looks perfect." Both Simmons and Bank OZK, like many banks nationwide, have implemented Positive Pay services geared primarily toward business customers. Positive Pay matches specific check data against a list provided by the company, prior to processing. That data includes dollar amount, check number, date and account number. "Check fraud remains a widespread concern, especially with the uptick in instances related to mail theft," said Susan Helms, executive vice president and director of treasury management at Bank OZK. "Positive Pay services give our clients peace of mind by only clearing debit transactions that were previously authorized." Beyond technology advancements, banks are deploying other eye-catching methods to draw attention to check fraud. Last fall, for example, Simmons Bank hosted bank-fraud expert Frank Abnagale at its Little Rock headquarters to give employees first-hand insight on how to identify forged checks. Abnagale has worked both sides of bank fraud: as a criminal trying to pass fake checks and as a consultant working with law-enforcement agencies and the banking industry to combat the issue. His exploits gained notoriety in the Steven Spielberg film "Catch Me If You Can" in which Abnagale was portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio. At Simmons, Vogt said the security team has internal triggers to review and check images to identify potential counterfeits on a daily basis. The bank also conducts regular monthly meetings with branch personnel to review procedures and outline any new counterfeit methods or trends that are developing. The surge in postal thefts and cases of check fraud led to the FinCEN alert issued in February in conjunction with the Postal Inspection Service. The organization said the "alert provides an overview of a recent surge in mail theft-related check fraud, highlights select red flags to assist financial institutions in identifying and reporting suspicious activity and reminds financial institutions of their reporting requirements under the Bank Secrecy Act." Bankers and industry officials offer a common refrain for individuals to avoid stolen checks: use common sense and avoid dropping checks in a U.S. Postal Service blue-box collection point, especially after hours and over the weekend. To do so increases the likelihood your check to a utility company or for your mortgage will be stolen and your bank account will be compromised. Any stolen check puts customers at risk for losses because counterfeiters will have the vital information necessary to replicate checks: the actual image, routing number and bank account number. "If your check is stolen, your account has been compromised," Vogt said. "You can't leave that account open." The check-fraud explosion has led financial institutions to be more proactive in working closely with law-enforcement agencies to detect fraud and run down criminals. "They've been very responsive when we reach out to them," Vogt said of the collaboration with local and federal investigators. Another trade group, the Independent Community Bankers of America, also advocates that members build stronger ties with law enforcement to combat fraud. "FinCEN's recent alert on mail theft-related check fraud provides further insights on potential red flags to watch for," said Steven Estep, the organization's assistant vice president of operational risk. "By implementing strong collaboration and communication practices and following FinCEN's guidelines, banks can help prevent check fraud and safeguard their customers' assets."

        A former state senator and nephew of a former governor has asked a federal judge in Missouri for leniency when he is sentenced April 25 in U.S. District Court in Springfield, Mo. Jeremy Hutchinson, a former state senator, son of former U.S. Sen. Tim Hutchinson and nephew of former Gov. Asa Hutchinson, filed a motion asking U.S. District Judge Brian Wimes in the Western District of Missouri to sentence him to one year and one day in prison to run concurrently to a 46-month sentence he received in federal court in Arkansas. The wide-ranging bribery conspiracy spanned two states and brought down the political careers of a number of Arkansas politicians, including Hutchinson. Hutchinson, 49, of Little Rock, pleaded guilty in June 2019 in Little Rock to federal charges of bribery and filing a false tax return and was sentenced to 46 months in prison by U.S. District Judge Kristine G. Baker, who also ordered him to pay $355,535.10 in restitution to the Internal Revenue Service and the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration. Although Hutchinson was ordered to report to prison by March 6, a court order filed three days earlier indicated that the U.S. Bureau of Prisons had not designated a facility for him to report to so he was given an additional three weeks of freedom. Also, according to the order, the government had represented that the Bureau of Prisons would wait until Hutchinson is sentenced in Missouri before designating a facility for him to report to. According to a plea agreement filed July 8, 2019, Hutchinson pleaded guilty in Missouri's western district to one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States in exchange for the dismissal of numerous bribery and fraud counts. He faces a maximum prison term of five years, a maximum of three years' supervised release and a maximum $250,000 fine when he is sentenced. In his sentencing memorandum filed Wednesday, Hutchinson asked to be sentenced to the same prison term as two of his co-defendants, orthodontist Benjamin Burris of Jonesboro and Hank Wilkins IV, a former state representative from Pine Bluff. Hutchinson's sentencing date has been postponed a number of times as he waited to testify in the federal trial in Missouri of two Preferred Family Healthcare executives, Tommy Ray Goss, the former chief financial officer, and Goss's wife, Bontiea Bernedette Goss, the former chief operating officer. The two were scheduled to go to trial Oct. 3, but the trial was canceled less than a week before it was to begin when both Gosses pleaded guilty to federal conspiracy counts. Hutchinson was one of a number of state lawmakers ensnared in illegal dealings with executives of Preferred Family Healthcare. Other lawmakers include Republicans Jon Woods and Micah Neal, both of Springdale, and Democrats Wilkins of Pine Bluff and Eddie Wayne Cooper of Melbourne. Woods was convicted May 3, 2018, of 15 counts of public corruption and is currently serving 18 years in federal prison. According to the Bureau of Prisons, Woods is scheduled for release in mid-2033. Neal pleaded guilty in January 2017 for his role in the same scheme, and he testified against Woods. Neal was sentenced in September 2018 to three years of probation with one year to be served under house arrest. Wilkins was sentenced last month to a year and a day in prison and ordered to pay $123,000 in restitution. No sentencing date has been set for Cooper, whose legal proceedings were handled by a federal judge in the Western District of Missouri. Hutchinson is represented in the Missouri case by Tim Dudley of Little Rock and Nancy Price of Springfield, Mo.

        The Arkansas Board of Education on Thursday took control of the 306-student Marvell-Elaine School District and directed Education Secretary Jacob Oliva to explore entering into a "transformation contract" with a third party to operate the district as permitted by new state law. The Arkansas LEARNS Act, or Act 237 of 2023, authorizes a school district that has a D- or F-rated school or is in need of "Level 5 -- intensive support" to be exempted from sanctions if the school board contracts with a charter school or another third-party entity to operate a public school district transformation campus. The tiny school district, which now has the highest expense per student in the state at more than $19,000 per student and the lowest overall student achievement rate, is in Level 5 of the state's accountability system. The Marvell-Elaine Elementary and High schools both have state-applied F grades. "We would be blazing a trail," Stacy Smith, state deputy education commissioner, told the state board about the potential for entering a contract with a third party for school transformation. The Education Board met Thursday in the high school gymnasium in the Marvell-Elaine district. In addition to the Marvell-Elaine issue, the Education Board approved: The overhaul of the state's seven-year-old math and English/language arts standards. A waiver of first-time teacher licensure application fees for the following period: May 1, 2023, to Aug. 31, 2023. Almost two dozen members of the audience addressed the Education Board -- including one who did so in song -- in support of preserving the Marvell-Elaine district. "One thing I've learned is that [Marvell-Elaine] Mustangs always stick together," high School junior Kayla Gatsun told the board in asking that her school district not be consolidated with another district. As a result of the Education Board's votes on a series of motions: The Phillips County district will continue to exist but operate under state control with Oliva acting in lieu of the district's elected school board. The current Marvell-Elaine School Board will remain in an advisory capacity through the end of the current school year. Katina Ray, superintendent of the district, will remain involved in the operation of the system through this school year. Any proposed transformation contract -- be it with an open-enrollment charter school, education service cooperative or another organization -- would ultimately go to the state Education Board for final approval. The state Education Board had voted late last year to deny the Marvell-Elaine district's request for a waiver of the state law that requires at least 350 students to operate a school system. That state Education Board vote set up the Phillips County system to be absorbed by one or more other school districts for the upcoming 2023-24 school year. On Thursday, Smith described the pros and cons of different annexation plans with surrounding districts -- such as Barton, Helena-West Helena and Lee County. Those plans included the possibility of splitting the Marvell-Elaine system students between multiple districts, sending Elaine students to Barton and Marvell students to Helena-West Helena Lee County. "There is not a winner," Smith said about the possible partnerships, noting that both Lee County and Helena-West Helena are themselves operating under state control. There were also concerns about whether partner districts could adequately absorb Marvell-Elaine's $4 million building debt. Each of the potential partner schools would likely close the Marvell-Elaine campuses. Smith described additional options available beyond a traditional school district annexation as a result of new legislation. The freshly signed House Bill 1504, for example, allows a district of under 350 students to continue to operate if students in the small district would have to travel more than 40 miles to a school campus in a consolidated school system. That new law eliminated Brinkley, Clarendon, DeWitt, and McGehee as districts that could absorb the Marvell-Elaine system, Smith said. The new Arkansas LEARNS Act provision authorizing transformation contracts would enable the Marvell-Elaine district to continue to exist and to keep its campuses open, although its teachers would likely have to reapply for jobs. Students in the Marvell-Elaine district would continue to be eligible to exercise choice out of their home district. The Arkansas Division of Elementary and Secondary Education would put out an "all call" for proposals from interested parties to manage the school district. The Marvell-Elaine district would pay the cost of what would likely be a three-year contract, Smith said. She said that already three potential partners have surfaced: the Friendship Aspire charter school system, a team of two education service cooperatives and a Marvell-Elaine community group, starting with the upcoming 2023-24 school year. Smith told the board that the transformation contract is an opportunity to do something different. "There has to be a transformational change in the district," Smith said. "What is happening in the classrooms is not OK. Students are not getting the education they deserve." Andrew Bagley, owner of the Helena World newspaper and a former teacher in the Elaine School District before its 2006 merger with Marvell, urged approval of the transformation contract plan, saying that the practice of consolidating school districts has run its course and that the LEARNS Act gives east Arkansas an opportunity to do something that has never been done before. "This district has immense potential," Bagley said. "It has good facilities and it has students who are capable." With Oliva in charge and a third party operating the district, "I believe this district can become a national showcase for why the LEARNS bill was the right answer to the question," he said. Rosie Tate, a teacher of more than 50 years and now a community volunteer, sang the song "The Greatest Love of All" in her support of the Marvell-Elaine students. Rep. Mark McElroy, R-Tillar, sponsor of HB1504, thanked the board for meeting in Marvell-Elaine and listening to people. "I want to thank our governor. The LEARNS Act is just what we needed," said McElroy, who did a little dance of joy when the Education Board voted 7-0 to authorize discussions with potential third-party operators of the district. There is no deadline for those discussions to be completed, Smith said in response to questions from Education Board member Sarah Moore of Stuttgart. "Our hope is to quickly try to turn something around," Smith said, adding that the proposed contract will go to the Education Board when state officials are comfortable with it. "If we can bring you something in two weeks, we will," Smith said but also said it could be a month or two away. Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders championed the 145-page omnibus LEARNS Act that -- in addition to authorizing the transformation contracts between school districts and third-party organizations -- raises the minimum teacher salary to $50,000 statewide and expands the use of taxpayer money for private school tuition and supplies. LEARNS stands for literacy, empowerment, accountability, readiness, networking and safety. Oliva praised the Marvell-Elaine community members for their monthslong interest in the district's future and he applauded the governor for getting the legislation passed that creates opportunities for every student to be successful in life. Marvell-Elaine joins the Pine Bluff, Earle, Lee County and Helena-West Helena districts that are currently operating under state control.

Members of the Planning Commission voted to accept the withdrawal without prejudice of the Bale development proposal as part of the commission's consent agenda. "The applicant submitted a letter to staff on March 8, 2023 requesting this application be withdrawn, without prejudice," Planning Commission documents said. "Staff recommends approval of the withdrawal request." Bale Chevrolet executives have sought to make the site up the road from River Mountain Park the new location for their dealership currently located at 13101 Chenal Parkway. Developers with Flake & Company and the firm of Joe White & Associates pursued a planned commercial development that could support residential, office and commercial purposes, including the dealership, on a total of 33 acres. The proposal before the Planning Commission would have rezoned the property from PD-R (planned development-residential) and R-2 (a type of single-family zoning) in favor of the new planned commercial development. The land is owned by a revocable trust associated with Bonnie Harvey, according to property records maintained by the Pulaski County assessor's office. Joe White of Joe White & Associates along with Flake & Company officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment via email Thursday. When asked whether he or anyone else at the city of Little Rock asked or encouraged the developers to have the item withdrawn, Little Rock Planning and Development Director Jamie Collins wrote in an email, "It was an applicant requested withdrawal." The development is opposed by the Walton Heights-Candlewood Homeowners Association as well as Ward 4 City Director Capi Peck, who represents the surrounding area on the Little Rock Board of Directors. Peck's impression was that the withdrawal was procedural and the proposed development was not dead, she said by phone Thursday. Based on her recent dialogue with Hunter Bale, the developers still have a window of time through August to do the property deal, Peck said. However, developer John Flake is "going to be very focused on a lot of other things now" since the destructive March 31 tornado that hit the Little Rock metro area, Peck suggested. One is Pavilion in the Park, the shopping center where Peck's restaurant is located, she said. The shopping center, which Flake and his family purchased last year for $8.85 million, was damaged during the storm, and the restaurant is closed for the foreseeable future. The hearing before the Planning Commission had been delayed from December after the developers requested a deferral. Approval at the level of the Planning Commission on Thursday would have sent the proposal to the city board for final approval. Likewise, applicants can appeal a denial at the Planning Commission to take their proposal directly to the city board.

         A Saline County doctor indicted in 2020 on charges that he helped defraud the nation's military insurer out of millions of dollars was sentenced Wednesday to 102 months in federal prison and ordered to pay restitution of more than $4.6 million. Joe David May, also known as "Jay May," of Alexander, was found guilty following a six-day trial in June on 22 counts, including conspiracy, wire fraud, mail fraud, violating the anti-kickback statute, lying to the FBI, falsifying records, and aggravated identity theft. May, 41, was accused of "rubber-stamping" 226 prescriptions for expensive compounded drugs that were billed to TRICARE, the nation's military health insurer, in 2015 and 2016, and of lying to the FBI and falsifying records to cover up his involvement when the scheme began to unravel. Prosecutors said that over the life of the scheme, May pocketed thousands of dollars in kickbacks for his participation and that he lied to FBI investigators and produced falsified records in an attempt to make the prescriptions look legitimate. Following the execution of search warrants at compounding pharmacies around the country, May visited the FBI Little Rock office to answer questions about his prescriptions, claiming he only signed prescriptions for people he evaluated and denying he received kickbacks. After May got a subpoena for prescriptions and related records, he turned over only a small number of the prescriptions he signed and fabricated medical records to make it seem like the drug recipients were really his patients. Finally, as trial approached, May tried to characterize a $5,000 cash kickback as Oaklawn winnings from the 2015 Arkansas Derby. May, accompanied by his attorney, Patrick Benca of Little Rock, arrived at court with some two dozen family members and supporters in tow. U.S. District Judge Kristine G. Baker said that under U.S. sentencing guidelines, May's recommended sentencing range was 168 to 210 months in prison. Arguing for a lighter sentence, Benca said that although May was responsible for signing hundreds of prescriptions that resulted in over $4.6 million in revenue, no evidence was ever produced to suggest that he had personally profited. "There was never really any type of benefit," Benca said. "He wasn't taking money and buying cars, he wasn't taking money and buying vehicles ... there's such an absence of what people typically do when they enter into a criminal enterprise and that is to gain something from it." Benca said there was no evidence of a financial windfall in the family bank accounts. In earlier testimony, May's wife, Jenna, testified that since 2012 she had handled the family finances and would have known if there was any outside money going through the family accounts. She said May's spending habits never changed during the time of the conspiracy. "I have an Excel spreadsheet from 2012," she said. "I can tell you any bills since 2012." Arguing for a guideline sentence, Assistant U.S. Attorney Alex Morgan said the amount of benefit May personally received was secondary to the overall harm caused by the scheme. Morgan said May, like most of his co-defendants, made a comfortable living in the medical profession. "This wasn't life-changing money," Morgan said. "This was walking around money. It's true for him and it's true for the others. Everyone was gainfully employed." Morgan said, however, "the fact that someone was tempted by relatively little money speaks not to mitigation but instead speaks to corruptibility." The question, he said, was not the benefit to the defendants but rather the harm to society, which he said was how the seriousness of the offense was quantified. Morgan said the scheme May was involved in was one of many across the country in 2015 that ultimately cost TRICARE $2 billion, which he said had to be made up by moving money away from other military uses "to include facilities on other bases charged with treating our active duty men and women." "Let's not take our eye off the ball," Morgan said. "That is the harm here to society. That's what speaks to the gravity of this. Not how much or how little money it took to be corrupted." Morgan said the overall scheme was relatively simple and although May wasn't the ringleader, his participation was vital because to make the scheme work, someone had to sign off on the prescriptions, which he said the two who headed the conspiracy, Glenn Hudson and Derek Clifton, could not do. "They needed a doctor," Morgan said. One thing that set May apart from his co-defendants, Morgan said, were his efforts to cover up his involvement once the scheme came undone. Those efforts, he said, included stonewalling investigators, lying to the FBI and, when ordered to produce records of his prescriptions, withholding records, altering records and even fabricating records to make it appear there was a standard doctor-patient relationship when in truth, May actually knew only one of the people receiving the prescriptions he signed. Following a half-hour recess, Baker returned to the courtroom and announced that, over the government's objection, she would grant a downward variance to 102 months in prison. "This conspiracy really seems to be a group of friends who were all participating together and, for lack of a more artful way of saying it, trying to help each other out," Baker said. She added that in many fraud cases, the total amount of loss is pocketed by the perpetrators, but in the TRICARE fraud, much of the money went to the compounding pharmacy for the prescriptions that were sent out. "Dr. May didn't pocket $4 million," she said. "I don't think there's any suggestion that he benefited to anywhere near the tune of $4 million. That doesn't negate the loss amount but in my view it does temper the loss amount." But, Baker said, May's efforts to mislead investigators was problematic. "Nobody has an obligation to cooperate with the government," Baker said. "Nobody has an obligation to talk to the FBI. But if you do, don't lie." In addition to the prison term and order to pay $4,637,322.09 in restitution to TRICARE, May was ordered to serve three years on supervised release after he leaves prison. He was ordered to report to the designated Bureau of Prisons facility on June 12 by 2 p.m. Investigations began across the country after TRICARE paid nearly $2 billion for compounded prescription drugs in 2015 alone, constituting an 18-fold increase over previous years. Losses from fraudulent prescriptions in Arkansas are estimated to have reached $12 million before TRICARE began cracking down on reimbursements.

         Two weeks after tornadoes tore through portions of Central and eastern Arkansas, the Federal Emergency Management Agency said it had approved over $4 million in aid for affected residents. Nearly 5,800 applicants in Pulaski, Cross and Lonoke counties have registered, a news release issued Thursday by FEMA states. Affected residents who applied for FEMA assistance will receive a letter explaining the status of their application, according to the agency. The letter will explain the type of assistance residents have been determined eligible to receive, as well as the amount of assistance FEMA will provide for each. The letter will also explain why an applicant has been determined to be ineligible for assistance, according to the release. Applicants who disagree with the agency's decision or the amount of aid listed can send an appeal letter, as well as supporting documents. According to the agency, the appeal must be in writing, signed and dated. FEMA disaster assistance will not affect government assistance Arkansans may currently receive, such as Social Security benefits, Medicare, Medicaid, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or other federal programs, the agency said. The agency said federal disaster grants can help pay for serious disaster-related needs not covered by a person's insurance, such as temporary housing, essential home repairs and personal property replacement. Three Disaster Recovery Centers opened in the state this week. The centers are at: North Little Rock Community Center, 2700 Willow St., North Little Rock. West Central Community Center, 8616 Colonel Glenn Road, Little Rock. Ridgeview Church, 999 U.S. 64 East, Wynne. FEMA and the state will open joint Disaster Recovery Centers in Jacksonville and Sherwood on Friday. As with the other Disaster Recovery Centers in Arkansas, survivors can visit the centers to meet with representatives from FEMA and the Small Business Association, as well as state and local agencies. The new centers, which will open at 7 a.m. and close at 7 p.m., are located at First United Methodist Church, 308 W. Main St., in Jacksonville and Wildwood Center & Medical Tower, 2402 Wildwood Ave., in Sherwood, a release from the agency states. Staff from FEMA, Small Business Administration, and state and local agencies will be available to meet with people about disaster assistance. At the centers, people will be able to download documents needed for their disaster recovery applications. At each location, people can also apply for assistance, learn the status of their FEMA application, get help to understand any letters from the agency, find housing and rental assistance information, get answers to questions or resolve problems, get referrals to agencies that may offer other assistance, and learn about loan programs available from the Small Business Administration. Arkansans who want to check the status of their applications for FEMA assistance can visit DisasterAssistance.gov. The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Tuesday announced temporary flexibilities for SNAP recipients in Pulaski, Cross and Lonoke counties. SNAP recipients can purchase hot foods using their benefits until April 30, a release from the agency states. Recipients will also have until May 1 to report any loss of food as a result of power outages caused by the tornadoes. Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders has also encouraged residents who need assistance to visit helparkansas.com. LOCAL UPDATES Little Rock had distributed over 250 hotel vouchers to residents by Monday, and there was a waiting list for additional assistance, according to a news release from the city. The Red Cross is providing case management services for those on the waiting list, and the nonprofit's temporary shelter at Calvary Baptist Church, 5700 Cantrell Road, remained open, the release states. A voicemail left with city spokesman Aaron Sadler seeking an update on the voucher program wasn't immediately returned Thursday. Little Rock's Public Works Department and contractors continued to pick up curbside debris in affected neighborhoods, according to the city. On Twitter, the city encouraged residents to take part in National Volunteer Week by volunteering on Saturday morning in the neighborhoods affected by the tornado. The cleanup will run from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. Lunch and T-shirts will be provided, the post states. Volunteers can sign up at tinyurl.com/LRVols. North Little Rock permanently closed its Tornado Relief Headquarters on Thursday evening. The headquarters, 1300 Pike Ave., had "completed its mission," a news release from the city states. Assistance from FEMA, the American Red Cross and others is now at the city's Community Center, 2700 Willow St. The North Little Rock section of the Arkansas River Trail is open, with the exception of a section that stretches from the intersection of Tournament and Championship drives to the mayor's gate and soccer field, the city also said in a Facebook post on Wednesday. The golf course at Burns Park has also reopened. Debris can be taken to the Hospitality House parking lot, 402 W. Military Drive. The debris site is open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., and proof of North Little Rock residency is required. In Wynne, students began returning to class on Wednesday, starting with kindergarten through eighth grade. High school juniors and seniors began classes at the East Arkansas Community College Tech Center on Thursday, while freshmen and sophomores are expected to start today. Students can eat breakfast and lunch at their campuses at no charge for the rest of the school year, "regardless of their current meal status," according to a news release from Wynne Public Schools. Wynne residents are also under a burn ban, due to the extensive debris that remains in the city, a news release from Fire Department Chief Kory Ward states. The ban, which prohibits burning any material, will remain in effect "until further notice." During a City Council meeting on Tuesday, members approved an extension of Wynne's 10 p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew and voted to allow recreational vehicles and campers to be used as living quarters on personal property for a time period of 18 months. POWER RESTORED All Entergy Arkansas customers that could receive power have had it restored since Saturday, utility spokeswoman Brandi Hinkle said Thursday. Roughly 600 customers were without power in the state just before 2 p.m., according to an outage map. In some cases, though, the damage is on the building's side, rather than Entergy's, according to Hinkle. In those situations, the people responsible for the structure must make repairs before Entergy can safely restore power. The spokeswoman said that, at one point, Entergy was working with 1,600 residences and businesses that were unable to restore power for this reason. The utility is working on those cases as those structures are able to have power restored. The current demand for licensed electricians and construction workers is making it "difficult" to assess how long such efforts will take, she said. For those who need to completely rebuild their homes, Entergy is providing power for accounts who move into a temporary space, such as a mobile home, according to Hinkle. Customers seeking assistance can call 1-800-ENTERGY. SATURDAY STORMS A cold front driving across Arkansas throughout Saturday will bring a chance for severe thunderstorms, according to a National Weather Service briefing issued Thursday. The chance for severe weather will be greatest in central and eastern Arkansas. The main hazards will be hail as large as a golf ball and damaging winds, with speeds of up to 60 mph, the weather service said. Forecasters described the risk of tornadoes as "very low."

        The Arkansas Supreme Court on Thursday upheld a lower circuit court ruling against lawyer Chris Corbitt, who sued the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission after state employees prevented him from using his enhanced concealed carry license to bring a firearm into a building administered by the agency. In a 5-2 ruling written by Chief Justice John Dan Kemp, the high court found Corbitt failed to challenge all the grounds that Pulaski County Circuit Court Judge Cara Connors relied on when dismissing the case with prejudice. Specifically, the majority contended Corbitt did not address an argument that Arkansas Code Annotated section 5-73-322(h) does not create an affirmative right for a person with an enhanced concealed carry license to bring a firearm into places other than public universities and colleges. The opinion affirms the lower court's ruling without addressing the merits of the case. The case marks the third challenge to state gun laws that Corbitt has lost before the Arkansas Supreme Court, Corbitt said Thursday. The Conway attorney has filed several lawsuits testing the legality of firearm restrictions held by local and state entities, including the city of Little Rock, Pulaski County and Arkansas State University. The case originated in August 2021 after Corbitt attempted to bring a concealed handgun into the range house at the Dr. James E. Moore, Jr. Camp Robinson Firing Range. The Arkansas and Game and Fish Commission operates the range and a sign was posted on the range house barring firearms inside, according to the opinion. State employees denied Corbitt entry into the house even though Corbitt told them he held an enhanced concealed carry license. Corbitt left voluntarily and filed a legal complaint against the state agency the following day, according to the opinion. Justice Barbara Webb dissented, saying that after analyzing all the arguments raised by Corbitt it "is apparent that he has challenged all the independent grounds raised by the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission." Justice Shawn Womack also dissented, saying the court lacked jurisdiction in the case due to a section of the Arkansas Constitution that states "[t]he State of Arkansas shall never be made defendant in any of her courts." While Womack said he generally agreed with the dissent's analysis of how the issues were framed, he said he would not address the merits of the case due to the state's immunity. Keith Stephens, a spokesperson for the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, said in a written statement Thursday the agency was pleased with the decision which would allow state officials to continue operating the firing range "for recreational enjoyment while maintaining public safety at the highest level." "Our plan is to continue to celebrate the Second Amendment by connecting Arkansans, and our visitors, to high-quality hunting, shooting and outdoor recreation opportunities," Stephens said. He noted that state officials had operated the firing range for almost 50 years without an incident at the range house. "We want the public to know that we will continue to provide a safe environment for recreational shooters who enjoy all of the state's firing ranges," he said. Law school professor and attorney Robert Steinbuch, who represented Corbitt, said Thursday he was "repeatedly disappointed in the efforts of several justices on the Supreme Court to avoid ruling on cases." Steinbuch said none of the three cases regarding gun laws in which he represented Corbitt before the high court had resulted in justices ruling on the merits of the case. "It's my belief that this is an example of judicial activist where the court is trying to kick the can down the road to prevent lawful gun owners and lawful concealed carry licensees from acting on the rights that have been recognized by the Arkansas legislature," said Steinbuch. Steinbuch said he intended to bring another similar lawsuit against the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission within the next two weeks, this one filed on behalf of a different plaintiff. Corbitt on Thursday called for partisan elections to the state Supreme Court, claiming some justices were "card-carrying registered Democrats." He contended justices in the majority opinion had used a "procedural tripwire" to affirm the lower court ruling. Steinbuch and Corbitt pointed to Webb's opinion and contended they had addressed all opposing arguments. When asked if he hoped to see success in future litigation on state gun laws given the unfavorable rulings he had received, Corbitt said "the rule of law will eventually win." On Wednesday, a Craighead County circuit court judge ruled against Corbitt in a case he brought against Arkansas State University. In the lawsuit, Corbitt claimed the university unlawfully prohibited people with enhanced concealed carry licenses from carrying firearms in its First National Bank Arena. The university contended that since written notice was posted barring firearms in the arena, Corbitt could not enter with a concealed handgun. Corbitt pointed to a section of state law he said bars public universities from using written notices to prevent the carry of concealed handguns for people with enhanced concealed carry licenses. In her ruling against Corbitt, Judge Melissa Richardson noted a license to dispense alcohol covered the arena and cited a section of state law that allows such areas to post notices barring concealed handguns. Corbitt said he intended to appeal the ruling.  Print Headline: Justices rule 5-2 to reject gun ban appeal Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         A webpage design error put the essay question, "What is an accomplishment of the Governor's that you admire the most?" into the online application for state staff and commissions, according to a statement Thursday by the governor's office. The question was meant for the application to be an intern in the governor's office -- never for staff, state boards or commissions, said Alexa Henning, spokeswoman for the governor. Summer interns are temporary employees working for the state. "Our web vendor was supposed to be editing the internship application but instead mistakenly made additions to the boards and commissions form," Henning said in a statement. "That was never intended to be a part of the application. As soon as we realized it, we corrected it with the vendor. However, it should be news to no one that someone wanting to intern in any administration should support the work that principal and their team is pursuing." This year's interns will work from June 5 through July 28, according to the state's website. The goal of these internships is to give experience to young adults interested in public service. These summer jobs are available for U.S. citizens 18 years or older who are still enrolled in college, recently graduated or are high school graduates who have served at least two years of active duty in U.S. armed forces. Members of the state's 257 boards and commissions oversee state agencies and state licensing. For example, the state Alcoholic Beverage Control Board approves or denies liquor licenses. Examples of other boards include the Livestock and Poultry Commission, boards of trustees at state colleges and universities and professional boards such as the state Medical Board. A check of the staff and board application website Thursday confirmed the question is no longer there. The misplaced question was taken down Monday, according to former state lawmaker Nate Bell. "A person who was applying for a state board or commission told me about it, and I thought that couldn't be right," said Bell, a former state House member from Mena who now lives in Washington County. Bell went to the application website on Monday, found the question on page three and took a screenshot of it from the laptop computer he was using, he said. He posted the screenshot on Twitter at 6:45 p.m. Monday, according to the tweet's time stamp. Soon after he posted the question, it was gone, Bell said in a telephone interview Thursday.

         Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed 11 bills into law Thursday aimed at making the Arkansas' state parks more appealing to tourists. At a bill signing ceremony at Pinnacle Mountain State Park, Sanders signed a set of bills that she said is part of a larger initiative to boost the state's tourism industry. Among the bills the Republican governor signed Thursday is Senate Bill 464, which will give economic incentives for businesses near a select group of state parks in what the bill refers to as "Natural State Initiative Opportunity Zones." First Gentleman Bryan Sanders, who heads an advisory council dedicated to promoting outdoor recreation, said the state has yet to determine the four state parks that will serve as the basis of the opportunity zones. The law also will give income and sales tax credits for companies if they are operating a "tourism attraction project" near a state park. To be eligible for the tax credits, companies would have to make at least a $500,000 investment, or $250,000 in what the state deems a "high unemployment county." Sanders also signed Senate Bill 472 into law, which will allow state parks to sell alcohol. State parks would have to request permission from the Arkansas Department of Parks, Heritage and Tourism to sell alcohol or to contract with a third-party vendor to do so. Bryan Sanders said the law will allow alcohol to be sold at large events at state parks and by state and privately owned restaurants. The law also will allow for the sale of alcohol in state parks that are in dry counties. Sanders also signed a bill that will allow the Arkansas Department of Parks, Heritage and Tourism to maintain and repair trails without prior approval from the Division of Building Authority. "It gets rid some of the unnecessary government burdens and red tape, allowing our state parks to do what they do best -- serve the people who visit them," Sanders said. Sanders appointed her husband in January as chair of the Natural State Advisory Council to advise her on ways to promote outdoor recreation and tourism within the state.

         FAYETTEVILLE -- A new bridge in southeast Washington County was torn down Thursday without a single vehicle having crossed it. The county spent about $495,000 on the bridge at the intersection of Wyola and Parker Branch roads beginning in April 2021 when bids were taken and going through October 2022 when the bridge was completed. Washington County Judge Patrick Deakins said he and his administrative team reviewed all of the county's road and bridge projects after he took office in January and officials said the bridge, as originally designed, was going to cost the county an additional $1.1 million to complete. "Road Superintendent [Jeff] Crowder and his leadership in the Road Department knew there was a problem, and they brought it to our attention," Deakins said. Deakins said the cost of the project made it stand out. He said the work was approved by the previous administration, led by then-County Judge Joseph Wood, and he could find nothing explaining how the decision was made. "I don't have a good explanation as to why this was done," Deakins said at the site, talking over the noise of a hydraulic hammer and other heavy equipment breaking down the bridge and removing the debris. "This makes no sense to us," Deakins said. "It seems the county had these bridge structures and someone thought they should be used. It sounds like more of a solution in search of a problem." The bridge site is on Wyola Road, spanning London Creek just east of Parker Branch Road near Brentwood. The low-water crossing used in the past would frequently be underwater during heavy rain, according to Crowder, and if the culverts became blocked, stormwater would overflow the banks of the creek and flow across the road. During construction, a new low-water crossing was installed, and traffic on Wyola Road was diverted just south of the bridge site. Terry Coe lives on Low Gap Road and said he drives by the bridge site "twice a day, seven days a week" going to and from work, shopping and church. Coe, who has a background in construction, said he questioned the county about the project when he first saw the large bridge structures being placed there in March 2022. Coe said a larger set of culverts was all that was needed. "I tried to meet with county officials about the project and was was told I didn't know what I was talking about," Coe said Thursday. "It's made me sick for more than a year," Coe said. "And now they're tearing it down. It's a waste of taxpayer money." Tearing down the bridge structure and replacing it with a crossing using a series of 42-inch box culverts will bring the total cost down to around $664,000, according to Crowder, with the remediation work -- including demolishing the existing bridge structure and installing the box culverts -- costing about $170,000. Deakins and Crowder were at the bridge site Thursday watching the demolition of the structure that had been completed. Crowder said the bridge had been built using some cast concrete sections the county bought after they were ordered and then not used for a bridge project in Rogers. Using the taller structure meant the approaches on both Parker Branch Road and Wyola Road would have to be built up, Crowder said, which the county estimated would require more than 48,000 cubic yards of fill dirt. The fill dirt alone had an estimated cost of $486,680, according to the county. The county is planning to finish the work at the bridge site within the next few weeks, Deakins said.

        A female grizzly bear at the Little Rock Zoo was “humanely euthanized” Thursday after officials learned the bear had advanced dental disease, according to a news release the zoo issued Thursday afternoon. The 33-year-old bear named Nona was brought to the zoo at age 2, along with her sister, Ann, the zoo said. The bears were originally from Montana, where they had grown comfortable approaching campsites, leading to them being labeled “nuisance bears,” the zoo said. “On April 11, Zoo staff observed an abnormality in the bears mouth, so an examination was scheduled to further diagnose,” the news release said. “Once the extent of the disease was known and weighing the long-term effect on the bears future quality of life, the decision was made to euthanize.”  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         Members of the Little Rock Municipal Airport Commission at a meeting on Thursday sparred over whether to enter an executive session to consider officer appointments after the recent addition of the panel's seventh member. The Little Rock Board of Directors voted to confirm Dr. Harold Betton to a five-year term on the Airport Commission on March 14. At a meeting two days later, airport commissioners entered executive session to discuss officer appointments after commissioner John Rutledge Jr. said he had been "advised of an officer's intent to resign their position." Rutledge did not name the person. When they returned from the executive session at the March 16 meeting, Chair Jill Floyd reported no action had been taken. However, email records later showed Floyd wrote to other commissioners on the morning of March 16, "With the appointment of our 7th commissioner, I feel it only right that we revisit officer selection. Therefore, I am [providing] my intent to resign as chair. So that we do not have a vacancy, this resignation will become effective after a new chair has been elected. In the event a new chair is not elected, this resignation is automatically rescinded." Commissioners had made officer appointments for the 2023 calendar year at a meeting in February. At that time, they tapped Floyd to serve as chairman for another year. Stacy Hurst was named vice chairman/treasurer and Bill Walker was named secretary. On Thursday, commissioner Patrick Schueck cited the addition of the seventh member and asked Floyd whether she intended to resign as chairman to allow them to elect officers. Some back-and-forth between the two ensued as Schueck pressed Floyd on the question. Floyd referred to her earlier written resignation statement and the executive session in which no action was taken. Walker suggested the issue already had been addressed during the executive session that was held after Betton joined. Hurst said she remembered the executive session differently. Referring to Floyd's March 16 email, Hurst made a motion to enter executive session "for the purpose of considering the resignation and appointment of a public officer." Walker and Floyd lodged objections. Floyd at one point called the motion "a mischaracterization of what I've said." After a procedural discussion involving the attorneys for the airport, commissioners ultimately voted 4-3 to adjourn based on a motion made by Walker. Floyd, Walker, Betton and Tiffany Mays O'Guinn voted yes. Hurst, Schueck and Rutledge voted no. Earlier, commissioners on Thursday approved several work authorizations tied to construction projects: a hotel and travel plaza near Roosevelt Road and the creation of a central utility plant. They also gave approval for the firm Garver to study current and future electric vehicle charging needs across the airport's campus and create a development plan at a cost of up to $102,718.

         Sherwood man charged in robbery Sherwood police on Wednesday arrested a man who they say told them he had a role in an armed robbery last week. Officers interviewed Raylon Jackson, 18, of Sherwood on Wednesday afternoon about an aggravated robbery at an apartment at 3496 East Kiehl Avenue, according to an arrest report. A baby was in the apartment at the time, police say. Jackson told police he was in the apartment when a second suspect was shot, but he refused to identify the other person, the report says. It says Jackson was seen on video running from the scene to a place where he ditched some of the evidence. Jackson faces felony counts of aggravated residential burglary, tampering with physical evidence and hindering apprehension as well as a misdemeanor count of endangering the welfare of a minor. He was being held in the Pulaski County jail on Thursday evening, an inmate roster showed. Drugs, gun found in LR traffic stop Little Rock police on Wednesday arrested a man they say had drugs and a gun during a traffic stop. Officers pulled over Brian Flowers, 34, of Little Rock on Colonel Glenn Road around 4:45 p.m. because they saw his vehicle had highly tinted windows, according to an arrest report. The exact location of the arrest had been redacted by a Pulaski County jail employee. A search of the vehicle located a pistol, suspected marijuana, pills and drug paraphernalia, the report says. Flowers faces felony counts of simultaneous possession of drugs and a gun, possession of a firearm by a certain person, two drug possession counts and a drug paraphernalia count. He was being held Thursday in the Pulaski County jail in lieu of $75,000 bond, the jail's inmate roster showed.

         The Pulaski County Office of Emergency Management has installed its first solar-powered tornado siren in the county. The siren, which replaced a previously damaged electric siren located in West Pulaski, is powered by a solar panel instead of connecting to an electric line or transformer for electricity. The solar panel draws energy from the sun to charge the siren's battery. The county is considering adding more solar-powered sirens, said Madeline Roberts, spokesperson for the county. "It's independently powered and doesn't have to connect to a power line or transformer like other tornado sirens do," she added. "It's more energy efficient and, even if the power goes out, it can still charge its battery." The siren will also save the county about $250 a year, Roberts said. The Office of Emergency Management is responsible for 33 tornado sirens in the unincorporated areas of Pulaski County. The county partners with Goddard Enterprises to maintain the tornado sirens. In addition to being tested every Wednesday, the sirens are monitored daily and undergo advanced testing four times a year.

         100 years ago April 14, 1923 FORREST CITY -- Gov. T.C. McRae arrived this morning to make a principal address at a two-day school fair, which opened here today. With a parade participated in by 20 schools in St. Francis County, represented by more than 4,000 school children, The March was headed by the Boys Scouts' flag bearer, followed by the Boy Scout drum and bugle corps of 13 pieces. Governor McRae was entertained with a business men's luncheon at Hazen's cafe at noon and addressed the school children and visitors at 2 p.m. at the high school auditorium. 50 years ago April 14, 1973 Arkansas school districts will receive a windfall of almost $1 million in federal funds for their school lunch programs, state Education Director A. W. Ford disclosed Friday. Ford said the Education Department had received a check for $961,301 from the Agriculture Department. An additional $17,434 will be distributed to nonprofit private schools participating in the Agriculture Department's lunch and breakfast programs. 25 years ago April 14, 1998 Little Rock will get a $3 million federal loan to pay for street and drainage work. U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Andrew Cuomo announced Monday the city is guaranteed the loan to pay for work in Community Development Block Grant redevelopment areas, where most residents have low and moderate incomes. Little Rock approached HUD for the loan in 1997 as part of the city Board of Directors' $7.5 million special account for infrastructure projects. Because the loan required federal approval, the city did not have access to the money until now. The HUD-funded projects are in addition to those to be paid for by a $16 million bond issue for infrastructure approved by directors in March. 10 years ago April 14, 2013 Legendary Nashville producer and songwriter "Cowboy" Jack Clement, chosen last week to be inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame, has some sweet Arkansas memories that inspired him to write at least one song about childhood days in Newport. Clement ... will be inducted into the nonperformer category in a ceremony later this year alongside fellow inductees Kenny Rogers and Bobby Bare.

         ROGERS -- Rogers plans to acquire more land near the Rogers Executive Airport. The City Council on Tuesday unanimously approved the purchase of 4.36 acres near Etris Drive, just west of the airport, from the Weiser Family Revocable Trust. The land is the first of two tracts the airport is looking to add amid recent projects on the northeast side of town, airport manager David Krutsch said. The airport plans to use funds allocated under the federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, from which the facility receives about $762,000 each year and had saved about $1.5 million as of November, according to Krutsch. A total of $250,000 is appropriated for the acquisition. The property was appraised at $225,000, according to the city resolution. The airport requested an additional $25,000 for expenses related to the purchase. Two contracts with North Little Rock-based firm Garver were approved by the council in recent months -- one related to the reconstruction of the airport's taxiway lighting and airfield electrical vault and another for land acquisition support services. A large expansion project at the airport was completed in early 2022, and hangar development projects are also in the works in order to keep up with demand, Krutsch said. The city's 2023 budget for the airport estimates just over $1 million in revenue, $922,763 in expenses and capital projects and a $103,237 surplus.

         HOT SPRINGS -- Two of the primary meth distributors arrested in December in a drug task force raid on a previously shut down residence on Mountain Pine Road pleaded guilty to drug charges Wednesday in Garland County Circuit Court. Kaleb Lamar Matthews, 23, of Hot Springs, and Christopher Blake Catlett, 31, both pleaded guilty to delivery of meth stemming from controlled buys made from each of them between September and November by investigators with the 18th Judicial District East Drug Task Force using confidential informants. Matthews was sentenced to the maximum of 20 years in prison, with 12 years suspended, for a total of eight years in prison while Catlett was sentenced to 20 years with all of it suspended. Both were also fined $1,000 and ordered to pay court costs. As part of his plea, Catlett had also agreed to testify against Jordan Barrett Stiles, 30, who has a hearing set for May 16. On Dec. 2, shortly after 6 a.m., the drug task force and other area law enforcement agencies conducted a raid on a residence at 664 Mountain Pine Road, which was the listed address of Stiles, and arrested multiple suspects found there on numerous felony drug charges. In a news release issued later that day, Deputy Prosecutor Trent Daniels, acting commander of the task force, noted investigators had identified Stiles, Matthews and Catlett as the primary distributors of meth at that location and numerous purchases of meth had been made by investigators from the three of them. In addition to other charges, Stiles was charged with engaging in a continuing criminal gang, organization or enterprise, punishable by up to life in prison. Daniels said Stiles had been arrested in 2013 at the same location and was legally enjoined from being on the property and the residence was boarded up. He told The Sentinel-Record at the time that Stiles was the main one setting up the purchases but would often use Matthews or Catlett to make the transactions. "Basically, you have these people who aren't supposed to have guns, aren't supposed to be on that property, who were on that property, with guns, selling drugs," he said. "It was a major nuisance to the community." According to a probable cause affidavit, drug task force investigators, agents with the Department of Homeland Security, the Garland County Tactical Response Team and sheriff's investigators, and the Hot Springs police special investigations unit executed a narcotics search warrant at the Mountain Pine Road residence, which is owned by one of Stiles' relatives, after multiple sales of meth had been made from there. The Tactical Response Team made entry through the front door and made contact with multiple occupants found inside. After they were all detained and secured, a search of the residence began. Investigators reported finding 36 baggies with a total of 116.7 grams, or over 4 ounces, of what later tested positive for meth; a bag with 7.7 grams of psilocybin, or psychedelic mushrooms; a bag with 4.2 grams of fentanyl; three bags with a total of 18.7 grams of marijuana; 47 grams of K2, or synthetic marijuana; three vials with 68.5 grams of propionate; three alprazolam pills; and 2.3 grams of an unknown substance sent to the Arkansas Crime Laboratory. The investigators also reportedly found $1,595 in cash, multiple empty baggies, digital scales, a Mossberg bolt-action rifle, a Glock 19 pistol loaded with a 30-round magazine, seven cellphones and drug paraphernalia. A civil action was filed enjoining the occupants from access to the residence, which was once again boarded up. Kaylea Kristin Childs, 29, who also listed the residence as her address and was arrested that day on multiple felony drug charges, also has a hearing set for May 16 in circuit court. Jason Paul Cozad, 43, and Patience Michelle Ann Clinton, 19, both of Hot Springs, who were also arrested in the raid, both pleaded guilty Tuesday to possession of drug paraphernalia with Cozad sentenced to three years in prison and Clinton sentenced to six years' supervised probation. Both also agreed to testify against co-defendants in the case.  Print Headline: 2 sentenced after drug raid arrests, guilty pleas Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         PRAIRIE GROVE -- Fourteen people applied by the March 28 deadline for the Prairie Grove School District's superintendent job, according to Ken James with the search firm McPherson & Jacobson. The board hired McPherson & Jacobson of Omaha, Neb., on Jan. 17 to conduct the superintendent search after former Superintendent Reba Holmes took a leave of absence Dec. 2 for the remainder of the school year and announced she would retire June 30. James said the applications came from candidates within the district and state and from out of state. James, a former Arkansas education commissioner who served before that as superintendent of the Little Rock School District, is the consultant for the superintendent search and is assisted by Megan Duncan, a deputy superintendent with the Fayetteville School District. James and Duncan will conduct a "complete vetting" of the applications and will present a recommended list of finalists to the School Board during a meeting at the administration building Wednesday. "We're pleased with the 14 applications," James said. "Some stand out more than others." The applications will be narrowed to a group meeting the board's criteria for the next superintendent. "Any recommended finalists we bring in, we are confident that candidate can do the job," James said. "The board decides who will be the best fit." James said the recommended finalists and a background of each person will be presented in open session Wednesday. The School Board then will go into executive session to watch videos submitted by the finalists and discuss which applicants to bring on campus for interviews. James said all candidates were asked to submit a video where they respond to the same three questions within a time limit. "This is an opportunity to put a name with a face and to see how they present themselves and how they come across," he said. The board will return to public session to announce the applicants they want to interview. Those interviews are tentatively scheduled for the first week of May. Each candidate will spend a full day in the district, James said. They will tour the schools and meet with the four stakeholder groups -- teachers, administrators, classified employees and students -- for about an hour each. Later in the afternoon, each candidate will have dinner with the board, including the candidate's spouse, in an informal atmosphere and then will meet in a closed two-hour interview with the board. "It's a long day for everybody," James said. "Each one goes through the exact process each day." The new superintendent is expected to begin the job July 1, according to the job description. Holmes' announcement of her retirement came two days after a controversial video on school security was shown to teachers during professional development time. The video was shown as a memorial to those who were killed during a fictitious school shooting at a Prairie Grove school. The video used photos of Prairie Grove teachers or their children as victims in the shooting. Pete Joenks has served as interim superintendent since Holmes went on leave. The school district has about 2,200 students in prekindergarten through high school, according to the job description.

         FAYETTEVILLE -- The Beaver Watershed Alliance, along with local partners, is developing a new source water protection program with a grant from the Arkansas Department of Agriculture's Natural Resources Division and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, according to a news release. The three-year federal grant, totaling $523,120, will be matched by local support of $460,936 for a total of $984,056. The money will be used to develop Smart Growth for Source Water Protection, for watershed management in urban areas of Northwest Arkansas. The program also plans to install low-impact development features within the Beaver Lake watershed area such as rain gardens, bioswales, pervious pavers and other stormwater collection features. Two locations have been selected for installations: the West Fork Library parking lot and a site along Huntsville Avenue in south Fayetteville. A third site will be determined later. Beaver Lake provides the drinking water for one in five Arkansans, according to the alliance. The alliance is working with community partners and Edgewater Coaching and Consulting to host six public forums on Smart Growth concepts. The first forum will take place at the Northwest Arkansas Regional Planning office in Springdale from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. April 27. Those interested in attending can sign up online at beaverwatershedalliance.org under the events page.

         A Hot Springs man was killed in a three-vehicle crash in that city on Wednesday night, according to a preliminary fatality report from Hot Springs police. Delano Gordon, 30, was killed around 8:17 p.m. as he performed a wheelie on a 2007 Honda CBR1000 motorcycle near the intersection of Central Avenue and Vineyard Street, the report says. A 2001 Toyota Camry turning left onto Vineyard Street from Central Avenue hit the rear of Gordon's motorcycle, throwing him off the vehicle, the report says. He landed in the center turn lane and slid before being run over by a third vehicle, a 2008 Ford Expedition, on Central Avenue, the report says. An officer investigating the wreck reported that the weather was clear and the road was dry at the time.

         Leaders from Siloam Springs, Gentry, Decatur, Gravette and Sulphur Springs have formed a group to promote and support the area's growth. The Western Benton County Partnership was formed in January and is working to obtain 501(c)3 status, according to Delia Haak, a Republican state representative from Gentry and the partnership's executive director. The partnership creates, promotes and fosters growth and economic prosperity for the area's communities, according to its mission statement. "The Western Benton County Partnership is structured much like the Northwest Council which Mark Simmons helped form with Sam Walton, J.B. Hunt and Don Tyson over 20 years ago," said Arthur Hulbert, president and CEO of the Siloam Springs Chamber of Commerce. "The Northwest Council was key in the development of the XNA airport and I-49 corridor." "Our goal is to partner with key stakeholders including municipalities, elected officials, school districts, chambers of commerce and the business community. We all face the same challenges here," Haak said. "The realization is that we can get farther together than we can independently." The partnership will focus on four areas: broadband access and affordability, child care access and affordability, the workforce and infrastructure. Haak said when most people think about infrastructure, they think of roads. However, the partnership is looking at not only roads but also bridges, railroads and transportation in general, she said. "There is a need for a four-lane between Siloam and the Missouri border," Haak said. Another plan the partnership is considering is a connector between Gravette and Northwest Arkansas National Airport, she said. With growth assured, the partnership aims to determine how the communities of western Benton County meet those demands as they come, Haak said. "We need to plan for the future and the growth that is on our way," she said. Municipal leaders from all western Benton County communities are taking part, Haak said. The partnership includes four co-chairs who represent each component: business, chamber, city and school. Greg Sutherland, who works at McKee Foods, will represent the businesses involved; Hulbert will represent the chambers of commerce; Gentry Mayor Kevin Johnson will represent the mayors of the cities involved; and Gravette School District Superintendent Maribel Childress will represent the school districts, Haak said. "The Western Benton County Partnership is another example of some of the great things going on in our region," Hulbert said.

         Student-athletes are coming to Southeast Arkansas College soon, and along with it the need for housing. College and community leaders turned over dirt during a ceremony Thursday to signal the start of construction and renovation of the former Davis Life Care Center into an athletic village called The Reef, in honor of the school's athletic identity, the Sharks. The facility is located at 6811 S. Hazel St., just across from SEARK's Seabrook Activity Center and 4 miles south of the college. The Reef will host up to 171 student-athletes, with the rest of the units available for non-athletes who need housing, according to school officials. The school will compete in baseball, softball and e-sports starting in the 2023-24 school year. The total cost of the project is estimated at $5.5 million, said Dee Brown, founder and CEO of The P3 Group, which is managing construction. That is a higher cost than college President Steven Bloomberg's $4.3 million estimation in March. The Memphis-based group will own and operate the facility but will endow $7.24 million back to SEARK over the next 20 years. "The Brown Foundation is the philanthropic arm of The P3 Group," Brown said. "We launched that 501(c)3 in order to give back to communities in which we do business. Under the structure of this project, we secured the financing on The P3 side to fund the balance of the construction activity, and of course Jefferson County pitched in about $1.5 million and donors pitched in as well through SEARK." The college approved a $2 million transfer from reserves to the construction account last month. SEARK acquired the nursing home for $990,000 in February. About $240,000 of the Brown Foundation contribution will go toward tuition and fees for residential assistants per semester. The P3 Group plans to build a program where the RAs can take leadership roles within the facility and include training and career-readiness tools "to help students prepare for the next step in life," Brown said. Jefferson County Judge Gerald Robinson expressed his pride in the vision Bloomberg had that is now coming to fruition. Bloomberg said in January having an athletic department would help preserve local high school talent for the next level and is a way to add to SEARK's student body. "This is a long-term relationship that will go past my term and [Bloomberg's] term," Robinson said. "It's a partnership that's everlasting." Work on The Reef begins just as SEARK is expected to name its first baseball and softball head coaches today, three months after the college announced it was adding athletics. The school invited three finalists for the softball job and two for the baseball position to campus this week for face-to-face interviews and an opportunity to meet the public. "This definitely isn't a marathon. It's a sprint," said SEARK Athletic Director Chad Kline, who started his role last month. "We're extremely proud. I'm a basketball coach, so I bank my career on recruiting and I think I've done one of my better jobs on hiring these coaches. I don't think they would have necessarily applied and gone full force if they didn't see our vision and Dr. Bloomberg's vision of this."

         Junior high and high school students in the Pine Bluff School District will unite starting next school year, and parents across the district took the opportunity to ask the superintendent important questions in three parent meetings this week. Jennifer Barbaree held meetings at Pine Bluff High School, Robert F. Morehead Middle School and Jack Robey Junior High School to update parents and other district patrons on plans to merge the student bodies. Barbaree in March announced Jack Robey, a feeder school to PBHS since 1986, would close due to high maintenance costs and Dollarway High students would join their counterparts at PBHS, as both schools have seen declining enrollments, resulting in lesser state funding. Barbaree has also said the district cannot afford to continue operating nine campuses – a pre-kindergarten building, four elementaries, two junior high schools and two high schools – if the district is to exit state control. "The group I'm saddest for is our 11th graders at Dollarway High School," Barbaree told parents at the Morehead campus, which has been a feeder school to Dollarway High. "This is not their choice, and it's not their fault." Reminding parents that the PBSD will operate under one athletic and activity identity, the Pine Bluff Zebras, Barbaree said she asked the students to come up with ideas on how to commemorate the Dollarway Cardinal identity at graduation. The Dollarway School District was annexed into the PBSD in July 2021. "It's not fair, but as an adult, it's my job to help kids understand that life isn't always fair," Barbaree said. Niya Allen, a Dollarway High graduate who has a daughter in the 11th grade, said her daughter had "iffy feelings" about joining the PBHS students at first but is OK with merger now. "Her concerns are with the safety of the school, the safety of the buildings in all," Allen said, asking Barbaree to tour the PBHS campus soon. "I don't want to move her because she's been a Cardinal forever, but my biggest concern was, were we going to move to Conway or was I going to leave her here?" The cost to renovate the roof just to install a new heating, ventilation and air conditioning system at Jack Robey is at least $12 million, according to Barbaree. The district's limited-authority board will likely ask patrons to increase the millage rates – 41.7 in the old PBSD zone and 40.8 in the old Dollarway zone – rather than just unify the rates in order to generate money toward completion of a new high school, which is expected to be built at the present PBHS campus. The board has not yet finalized the location. The Dollarway High students' move won't necessarily leave their campus vacant. Barbaree revealed she's leaning toward grouping seventh- and eighth-graders at the Morehead campus with ninth graders attending half of the Dollarway High campus, just across the street from Morehead on Fluker Avenue. Barbaree has left the door open to moving sixth-graders back to a secondary campus, which would likely move eighth-graders in with the ninth-graders, but she said district leaders are studying whether there's a cost benefit to doing so. Presently each elementary school houses grades K-6, but Barbaree said she has also entertained the idea of building "grade bands," or assigning each entire grade level to a school. Carmen Bell, who has children in the second, seventh and 11th grades, sees benefits to that. "The benefits I see is that those kids will be with their particular age groups," Bell said. "Right now, it's K-6. You have sixth-graders with kindergartners. Also, teachers can collaborate more." Bell's 11th-grader also attends Dollarway but does not feel negatively about finishing as a Zebra, just as she did. "He's just happy that he will still be with his classmates," Bell said. "I told him, when we were in school, we had over 500 in our class. He doesn't feel any ill will toward collaborating." As Barbaree put it, the high schools are now married. "If you and your spouse each have a home and you had to pick which home you are going to choose, in most cases both of you are going to choose the new house with nice things," she said.

         BENTONVILLE -- Ivan Wong of Centerton is the winner of the library's commemorative card design contest. The contest was part of the city of Bentonville's 150th anniversary. He received a $150 cash prize, sponsored by the Friends of the Bentonville Library. There were 85 entries, said Library Director Hadi Dudley. To celebrate and honor all who participated, the entries will be displayed at the library in May, Dudley said. Wong, 17, is a member of the library's Teen Advisory Board as well as a volunteer and library patron. He is a junior at Haas Hall Academy, according to a library email. Wong's commemorative card design will be unveiled at Bentonville GeekCon on May 6. The library will produce a limited run of cards for distribution this year. Wong will autograph 150 of them to share with the community, according to the library. Library staff plan to order at least 2,500 commemorative library cards. Friends of the Bentonville Library will sponsor the $1,750 cost, Dudley said.  Print Headline: Teen wins commemorative library card design contest Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.
