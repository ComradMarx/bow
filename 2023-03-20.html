        Two drivers under the age of 18 were killed in separate crashes on state roads, according to preliminary crash reports.  One driver died in an ATV crash that injured two passengers, all of which were minors, on Saturday, a preliminary crash report from the Arkansas State Police said.  The driver died at a hospital from their injuries after the 2013 Polaris Ranger they were driving crashed into a tree on the west side of Salem Cemetery Road in Lonoke County just before 9:45 p.m., the crash report said.  The identity of the driver was not immediately released.  The two passengers were also injured in the crash, the report said. One passenger was trapped when the Polaris rolled onto the driver's side. The other passenger was ejected from the ATV.  The injured were taken to Arkansas Childrens Hospital, according to the report.  Troopers at the scene reported that the weather was clear and that the gravel road was dry.  A crash in Pulaski County killed a girl on Friday, another crash report from the state police said.  The Maumelle girl was declared dead at the scene by Pulaski County coroner after the 2021 Subaru Crosstrek she was driving north on Interstate 430 crashed into a tree, the report said.  The girl's identity was not immediately released.  Troopers said the Subaru kept going straight as it approached the Interstate 40 westbound exit ramp in Little Rock and exited to the right before it hit a tree, started to rollover to the right and the top of the vehicle “impacted” the tree before coming to a stop around 11:30 p.m.  The weather was clear and the roads were dry at the time of the crash, the report said.  Over 15 people have died due to crashes on state roads this month, according to preliminary crash reports posted by the Arkansas Department of Public Safety as of Monday afternoon.  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         VAN BUREN -- A Crawford County Sheriff's Office deputy and another motorist were reportedly taken to a hospital after a three-vehicle collision Saturday, according to the Police Department. Cpl. Megan Slayton, police spokeswoman, said Monday deputy Adam Spears was responding to a call at about 2:10 p.m. Saturday with his lights and sirens activated when he collided with another vehicle driving through the intersection of Alma Boulevard and Alma Highway in Van Buren. The vehicle reportedly had the green light to proceed, according to statements made to police. Spears collided with another vehicle waiting to turn at that same intersection afterward. Emergency medical services took the driver going through the intersection, a woman, to a local hospital while Spears was taken to a hospital later, according to Slayton. The driver of the third vehicle claimed to not have any injuries. Sheriff Daniel Perry said Spears suffered a concussion from the collision without broken bones. He has since been released from the hospital, although he wasn't back on duty as of Monday morning.

        Some parts of the state could see rain, with a chance of some severe storms, as temperatures warm up throughout the week across Arkansas, the National Weather Service said on Monday. Erik Green, a meteorologist with the weather service in North Little Rock, said that the Little Rock area could see temperatures in the 70s as early as Wednesday.  “Monday is kind of the turning point, where we have the last of the real cold mornings, besides maybe some cooler temperatures in early Tuesday for northern Arkansas,” he said. Some places in southern Arkansas could see temperatures in the low 80s, while the rest of the state will likely see highs in the 60s and 70s, the forecaster said. “It is a textbook case of weather whiplash, also known as March in Arkansas,” Green said.  “Obviously temperatures in the upper 20s and lower 30s are not normal for this point in the season, so it will warm up to some more normal temperatures, but that also brings some more instability and a few chances of rain,” he said.  Showers and storms are possible on Tuesday and again on Thursday and Friday, a tweet from the weather service said Monday morning. Forecasters were still collecting data about how severe any storms this week could be, the tweet said.  Green said that more rainfall would increase the chances of localized flooding.  “For March, pretty much everybody is above normal for rainfall and we have more coming,” he said, “The soil is still saturated and some streams are still full, local heavy rainfall could make it worse.”  According to data from the U.S. Drought Monitor on March 15, 2022 just under 60% of the state showed no drought conditions while parts of southern Arkansas were in some level of drought.  As of Monday afternoon, the drought monitor showed that 100% of the state is classified as having no drought conditions.  On Tuesday some parts of central Arkansas and the metro area could see around a tenth of an inch of rain, Green said.  “Were not expecting to see a whole lot of rain early in the week but there is some chance we might see some on Tuesday and then Wednesday we have a day to briefly dry out,” the forecaster said.  Through Thursday and Friday some parts of the state could see an inch to an inch and a half of rainfall, though northern Arkansas has a chance to see more, he said.  “We have a higher confidence of some more storms and maybe up to two or even near three inches of rain in northern parts of the state,” Green said.  Matt Ramsey, a spokesman for Entergy, said Monday afternoon that fast weather changes mean customers are changing their thermostat temperatures more.  “A few degrees can save customers some money,” Ramsey said, “Turning it to 68 degrees on cooler months and 72 degrees on warmer months can help stop the unit from turning on so frequently.”  He said that during warmer months every degree lower than 78 can raise an electricity bill by 3%.  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        A 32-year-old man was arrested in connection with a shooting that killed one person at a convenience store near Southwest Drive, police said on Friday.  Russell Malone was arrested on March 13 and charged with first-degree murder in the death of Nicholas Childs, 37, Jonesboro police said in a Facebook post Friday afternoon.  Childs was found dead from an apparent gunshot wound at the Kum & Go at 680 Southwest Drive on March 10, the post said.  Malone was shown as being held in Craighead County jail on a $3 million bond, according to the county's online inmate roster.   Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         A joint committee of state senators and representatives approved a bill last week to create a needs-based scholarship program. The bill was approved Wednesday and would amend the Arkansas Academic Challenge Scholarship to include additional funds for students based on their financial needs. The proposed needs-based scholarship would be called the Arkansas Challenge Plus Scholarship. The state would use the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, also known as FAFSA, to determine eligibility for the scholarship and would dole out up to $5,000 on a "sliding scale" based on need, according to Maria Markham, director of the Arkansas Division of Higher Education. "We use the same calculation the federal government uses to calculate Pell awards, and we would increase the award amount for our students with the most need," Markham said. Under the Academic Challenge Scholarship, which is funded by the lottery and $20 million in general revenue funds, students are awarded funds based on their year in college. College freshmen attending a four-year institution are awarded $1,000, sophomores and juniors are awarded $4,000 and seniors can receive $5,000 from the scholarship program. Freshmen attending a two-year college can receive $1,000, with sophomores being awarded $3,000. The scholarship is open to students regardless of their financial need. In the 2021 legislative session, then-Gov. Asa Hutchinson proposed creating a needs-based scholarship program. Senate Bill 248, sponsored by Sen. Jane English, R-North Little Rock, is based on the previous proposal. The scholarship is open to traditional and nontraditional students. To be eligible for the scholarship, students must score at least a 19 on the ACT or an equivalent score on a similar test. The Division of Higher Education has awarded challenge scholarships to 28,421 students in fiscal year 2023 totaling $53.5 million, according to Nick Fuller, the division's assistant director of finance. In the previous fiscal year, the division awarded $75.1 million in scholarships to 28,716 students. The proposed Challenge Academic Scholarship Plus would cost the state roughly $13.5 million, which would be funded by excess lottery proceeds, according to an estimate from the Department of Finance and Administration. How much the Department of Education would distribute to students each year on the scholarship would depend on the lottery revenue that funds the state's various academic scholarships. The state previously had need-based scholarships but lawmakers canceled the programs in 2017, with Markham calling them "unsuccessful." "[For] low-income students, financial aid is the number one barrier for access to institutions, and this would be making a significant impact on their ability to afford a higher education," Markham said. The committee also approved a bill to extend the Concurrent Challenge Scholarship, a program for high school students taking college courses, to 10th grade students. House Bill 1333 originally would have made ninth grade students eligible for the scholarship, but committee members were concerned about funding scholarships for high school freshmen who may struggle with college courses. Lawmakers from the House and Senate also approved a bill to give in-state tuition to dependents of disabled veterans and to allow students to use state scholarship funds to enroll in summer classes. A bill to set aside $2 million in lottery scholarship funds for trade and technical schools was pulled from Wednesday's hearing, with lawmakers saying they will consider the bill at a later date, which would require an amendment to the state's constitution. Rep. Brian Evans, chair of the House Education Committee, said lawmakers will take up the bill again after the General Assembly returns from spring break March 27.

        A January dog attack and failed House bill have stirred the debate over bans on "dangerous" dogs in the state. House Bill 1519 — sponsored and presented by Rep. RJ Hawk, R-Bryant — aimed to prohibit municipalities across the state from establishing bans simply based on dog breeds or breed appearance. "I have witnessed many friends that have owned dogs and slowly their right to choose what dog they wanted was being taken away from them," Hawk said in an email Wednesday. "The dogs that they owned were perfectly good dogs and were only being discriminated against because of other bad dogs." Currently, there are an estimated 38 breed-specific dog bans in the state. The bill did not advance out of the house Tuesday, failing by a 34-45 vote with 10 members voting present. Representatives opposing the bill argued that it's a decision that should be left to local officials to continue to navigate and determine. Over the past few years several cities have lifted previously in-place dog bans and others continue to discuss if a ban might be necessary. The Maumelle City Council voted 5-3 in April 2021 on an ordinance that lifted a previously enforced pit bull ban. Two dog attacks since then have ignited debates on whether they could have been prevented had the ban not been lifted. The first attack from September 2022 resulted in the death of a small dog and serious injury to the owner, 73-year-old Marcus Higgins. The attack by two pit bull dogs left Higgins with stitches in the face, mouth and both hands, as well as further injury to a pre-existing spinal fusion, according to a report from Maumelle's city attorney, Melissa Krebs. Most recently, a Maumelle woman was attacked on Jan. 21 by a pit bull dog she was fostering in January. Kelly Dean, 35, was left with "tears" in her arms and leg after a "pit terrier/bull-mix" dog she was fostering attacked her after a fight between it and another dog on the property. A report by the Maumelle Animal Control noted "a trail of large blood drops" inside the garage and inside the home. Dean was transported to Baptist Health in Little Rock for treatment for the injuries. The aggressor dog and other dogs on the property were taken by animal control to determine what agency the dog was fostered from and what steps to take next. Council Member Steve Mosley argues that the attack, along with an attack from the summer of 2022, could have been prevented if the council would agree to put a dangerous-dog ban back in place. "We've now had two serious injuries to humans here in Maumelle that wouldn't have occurred had the council not lifted a long existing ban on such dogs," Mosley said. "Maumelle's two-year experiment with introducing Pit Bulls into our community certainly appears to be a failed experiment, and it appears that it's just a matter of time before an attack tragically involves a young child." Council Member Chad Gardner disagrees and voted in support of lifting the ban in 2021 and stood in support of House Bill 1519. "I think the goal of the bill is to treat all breeds equally and I certainly would have supported that," Gardner said. "In terms of it not passing, it really doesn't change anything, it just leaves it up to individual cities to make a decision on what they want to do." Gardner said the city would like to focus on handling dangerous dogs when presented with specific incidents, not banning whole breeds entirely. "We wanted to treat all dogs equally," Gardner said. "Before, when we banned certain breeds, that was taking time from our resource officers to have to go out and look for a potentially banned breed that wasn't even causing any issues. If there's a problem with a dog in particular, that's what we want to focus on instead of just banning breeds outright." Mosley has actively disagreed with the lifting of the ban and House Bill 1519. "Is some obscure social cause for a dangerous animal breed really worth the resulting human injuries that are occurring, and possible death?" Mosley asked. "The pit bull issue is highly divisive and it is best to let the current law remain in place and let individual cities decide." Officials on the Jacksonville Pit Bull Committee continue to discuss their current dog ban and what that looks like for the city. In the fall, the committee met and briefly discussed not lifting the existing ban, but making changes to the ordinance. If approved, the changes would have allowed for residents to have their pits "approved" under the ban through a series of regulations and requirements. Hawk reiterated that he does plan to continue to work on sponsoring a related bill that might better appeal to both sides. "I do plan on continuing to advocate for this bill. So much fact, Senator [Kim] Hammer was compelled by the debate in the house and is contemplating running the bill on the Senate side this session," Hawk said.

         Arkansas' kindergarten-through-12th grade public school system has experienced an overall uptick in teacher turnover during the school years marked by the covid-19 pandemic. That is one of the conclusions reached by a research team at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville that looked at job movement among teachers in the 2020-21, 2021-22 and 2022-23 school years as compared with previous years. Andrew Camp, Gema Zamarro and Josh McGee of the university's Office for Education Policy are the authors of the study. The research team found that the state's typical teacher retention rate of nearly 80% in the 2018-19 and 2019-20 school years dropped to 76.9% in 2021 and to 74.4% in the current 2022-23 school year. "Given that about 32,000 teachers are employed by Arkansas school districts each year, this indicates that about 1,250 more teachers left the classroom during the summer of 2022 than what we would have expected on average during pre-pandemic years," the research team found. Previously, there was a one-year dip to a 74.7% retention rate in the 2015-16 school year that jumped up to 77.1% the next year. At a time when student achievement has declined in the pandemic years, teachers -- who are generally recognized as the most important school-based factor for student achievement -- have indicated on surveys that they are stressed and considering job changes. "Given the serious challenges that Arkansas students face and apparent dissatisfaction among teachers, it's natural to be concerned about increased teacher turnover and potential teacher shortages," the authors wrote. The research team broke down the types of teacher turnover to include those who: Left or exited the profession -- 10.4% this year compared with 8.7% the year before. Moved from one campus to another -- 10.9% this school year compared with 11.2% the year before. Switched to a noninstructional role in public schools -- 4.3% in 2022-23, up from 3.3% in 2021-22. Teachers who moved from one campus to another or moved into noninstructional school jobs should prompt education leaders to identify why one school or one job is preferred over others, the researchers said. An even deeper dive is necessary to determine the reasons why greater numbers of teachers left the profession entirely, the team said. The research team also found that the teacher turnover rate varies across the state, with south and east Arkansas seeing higher turnover than north and west parts of the state. But all parts of the state have seen changes. Thirty-nine Arkansas districts saw turnover rates in excess of 35% this year, up from 15 districts in 2021-22. Entering this school year, 24 districts saw turnover rates of no more than 15%. But last year, a better-than-double 57 districts had a turnover rate of 15% or less. The research team looked into the status of teachers who exited the teaching profession, with the idea that the information could lead to the design of better teacher retention practices in the future. Eighty percent of those who left at the end of the 2020-21 school year "do not appear as an employee at any unemployment insurance-covered employer in the state," the team said. "Of those 'exiters' aged 60 or more, only 25, or 4%, appear in the Arkansas workforce, while 25% of exiters under the age of 60 do so. Among exiters who were employed, the most common job was working in the education services industry, such as a tutor or a consultant. The researchers opined that the fact that the former teachers did not immediately find new jobs might indicate that they left due to job dissatisfaction and not for better paying jobs. "Improving these other job conditions may encourage some exiters to return and reduce future turnover," the study authors wrote. The authors also noted that the news about teacher turnover "is not universally grim," that the higher turnover is not a mass exodus of educators. The study did not attempt to address how the newly enacted Arkansas LEARNS Act to revamp public education might impact teacher retention and turnover. The act, championed by Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, raises the starting teacher salary in the state by $14,000 to $50,000, making it one of the highest in the nation. The act also offers $2,000 pay raises to those teachers already making $50,000 or more and financial incentives to those who teach in parts of the state with teacher shortages. The act includes provisions for paid maternity leave and college loan forgiveness for those who become teachers. Arkansas LEARNS also eliminated the Arkansas Teacher Fair Dismissal Act, which provided job protections to teachers.  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         Seventh Street Elementary School hosted two community forum meetings for feedback on the North Little Rock School District's proposal to change the school to a prekindergarten through eighth grade model. Superintendent Greg Pilewski gave a presentation highlighting how Seventh Street Elementary has historically ranked in the bottom 5% in student achievement data over the past several years out of all schools in the state. The state could take over the school and the entire district if one school continues to underperform, Deputy Superintendent Torrye Hooper said. "We're trying to create various systems for them to be successful, whatever pathway they choose," she added. In the forums, administrators pointed out that from 2016-2022 Seventh Street had 83 staff members leave. It also changed principals four times and lost 46 licensed classroom teachers and 37 classified employees. The reconfiguration to a prekindergarten through eighth grade school would reduce the number of transitions students will have after middle school and into high school, Pilewski said. The school would add a sixth grade for the 2024-2025 school year, then add a seventh grade the following year and an eighth grade the following year to complete the reconfiguration by 2026. Students living in the community and currently enrolled in the school will have first priority for attendance. If seats are still available after that, students in or out of the school district can enroll through a lottery system, according to the proposal. "What made this an option is the fact that there's space here and that enrollment has declined," Pilewski said. "It's declined 1,500 students over the last decade, so part of our challenge to the school district is, number one, to keep the students we have, but we want to attract students. There's two ways to do that, one is to provide a niche, curricular opportunity, and to provide an option to families in North Little Rock that doesn't exist." The school would also add a theme and change its name to honor the North Little Rock Six, the six Black students who tried to desegregate the school for the first time on Sept. 9, 1957. The first proposed name was the "6-57 Learning Institute," which 71% of Seventh Street families voted no on, but 50% voted in favor to change the name to honor the North Little Rock Six and 61% of families in the district voted in favor to change the name to honor the North Little Rock Six. Upon the approval of this proposal, Pilewski recommended that Sept. 9 be recognized as "North Little Rock Six Day" districtwide each school year. "I will tell the board if the community is not ready for this [name change]," he said. "They're not ready for this, and we'll take that feedback and we'll keep going. Because the most important thing is I got 180 days to open the school with a whole new staff approach." At the board meeting on Thursday, an idea for the school to be named "North Little Rock Six Elementary," came up from the survey feedback. The theme options for the school include ASTEAMED, or Animal Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Math, Environmental Science and Design Thinking, Animal and Veterinary Science or Technology Integration and Ingenuity. Each theme would focus on a concept per grade level with the option to incorporate more content as students move up in grade level. No other school in the state has a theme of animal and veterinary science, so Seventh Street would be the first. An extended-day and extended-year model would also be implemented to allow for more intensive support in identified areas for students. Theme-based learning would continue in both of these models and embed industry partners into the programming. A master schedule was also presented for all of the grade levels, with Wednesdays being dedicated to intensive support groups, presentations and possible field trips. The students would also have an early release on Wednesdays to allow teachers to have more time for lesson planning, approximately 40 more hours per year, Pilewski said. All licensed staff would have to re-apply for their jobs at the start of the 2023-2024 school year to allow for Seventh Street to have the best possible teachers, he added. The school would also hire a literacy and math coach for small-group intervention. For the 2023-2024 school year, all licensed employees prekindergarten through fifth grade would be given a $10,000 stipend paid in three installments; in the 2024-2025 school year, all licensed employees prekindergarten through sixth grade would be given a $4,000 stipend paid in two installments; and in the 2025-2026 school year, all licensed employees prekindergarten through seventh grade would be given a $3,000 stipend paid in two installments. The estimated budget for the next school year with staffing, reconfiguration stipends, professional development, curriculum and instructional materials, field experiences and the extended day and year programs amounts to $702,000. A community advisory board was also discussed to bring together industry partners, parents, school staff, non-profit leaders, faith-based leaders, local government, student representatives and a school innovation coach. The superintendents said they hope to have this board formed in April. Pilewski said he doesn't want to delay an official board vote any later than July or August to inform parents of the change. "Getting the staff on board is the most important thing first when we've got to have everybody reinterviewed -- that's my number one priority right now because we're competing with other areas for teachers," he said. Sandy Williams, director of North Little Rock Academy, said he thinks the change is an excellent plan for the future. "It leads students in school in a progressive way, it gives students the wraparound services that they need, because these students need a great deal of services," he said. "It's going to also include community members to know what's going on in school. I've seen K through eight schools be successful, so I know that that can happen. It takes work and it takes transition and it takes time." Williams also said he hopes people "move out of their fear into their reality." Kendoris Lewis, a second grade teacher at Seventh Street, said she's excited for the transition to pre-K through eighth grade. "It's something that's new and better, I feel like our kids need this opportunity, they deserve this opportunity," she said. "I'm excited that our superintendent is finally putting the spotlight on Seventh Street. And we can be that school, they can say, 'hey, I want my kid there because they're doing something different, they're doing something new.'" Tracy Steele, a member of the district's school board, said it's good to see a positive change at Seventh Street and it'd be "even more special" if they could honor the North Little Rock Six. "I'm very optimistic we can turn this school around and be one of the best schools in this district, not only in this district, in the state," he said. "Because what we have now that we didn't have before is one, a plan, and two, the community support. This is my zone, so I want to continue to work hard to keep the community engaged. They're excited, and we're going to keep it going."  Print Headline: Seventh Street school forums discuss name, grade changes Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         The races for Little Rock traffic court judge and a state Court of Appeals judge representing the capital city have just become contested with announcements from two new candidates. Sixth Judicial Circuit Judge Herb Wright said he will run for traffic court after 14 years on the circuit bench that encompasses Perry and Pulaski counties. Little Rock attorney Pam Hathaway, a lawyer for 30 years, said she'll seek the appellate court judgeship coming open with next year's retirement of Rita Gruber. Judicial election season began two weeks ago, with the elections timed to coincide with the state's political primaries. Fundraising won't start until September, six months before the election. Wright has held a similar position, serving as Wrightsville District judge, before being elected to the circuit bench in 2008. Vic Fleming, the traffic court judge since 1997, has not said whether he will run for another four-year term. Little Rock attorney Robert Tellez has also declared his intention to seek the post. Wright of North Little Rock said he is interested in traffic court because of the potential to increase the court's efficiency, which has been his priority as a circuit judge "Little Rock Traffic Court is where most Arkansans are likely to have contact with the legal system and with my 19 years of experience, I believe I can bring improvements to this system," Wright said. "I have worked hard as a judge ... to streamline the experience so that litigants can resolve their cases fast and efficiently. My goal is to make Little Rock Traffic Court more user-friendly to the public, better utilize court resources, and keep officers serving the public instead of waiting in the courtroom." A married father of one, Wright, 60, has held leadership positions on the Arkansas Commission on Child Abuse, Rape, and Domestic Violence; Arkansas Capital Resource Center; Hugh O'Brian Youth Foundation; Center for Arkansas Legal Services; Central Arkansas Ducks Unlimited Committee; and Rotary Club 99. He is also the past president of the Arkansas Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers and the Pulaski County Bar Association. Hathaway, 55, said she has worked on thousands of appeals during her career. But she will also bring diverse experience to the District 6, Position 1, appeals judgeship, the married mother of two said. "My 30 years of diverse legal work as an Arkansas attorney has prepared me for this judgeship. I have been an attorney at the Friday, Eldredge, and Clark Law Firm, a solo practitioner, and a law clerk to five judges on the Arkansas Supreme Court and Arkansas Court of Appeals," she said in her announcement. "I understand the importance of hard work and perseverance. I put myself through college and law school. I faced and defeated breast cancer, and I was humbled to be named Komen Arkansas's 2013 Honorary Survivor. " Hathaway's professional memberships include the Arkansas Association of Women Lawyers, and the Judge William Overton American Inn of Court. Other community activities include Rotary Club 99, Komen Arkansas, the North Little Rock Chamber of Commerce, and the Board for the Home for Healing. Hathaway's candidacy brings her into competition with a former classmate, Molly McNulty, who said last week she will run for the post. Both women were part of the inaugural class of the Public Service Academy at the University of Arkansas Clinton School of Public Service.  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         TULSA -- Oklahoma's attorney general wants a court-appointed special master to oversee any agreement his state and Northwest Arkansas poultry companies arrive at in their negotiations to settle their federal court lawsuit, he said after a court hearing on Friday. U.S. District Judge Gregory K. Frizzell granted a 90-day extension to Friday's deadline for the parties to reach such an agreement, granting the motion requested by both sides during a status hearing in Tulsa on Friday afternoon. The next court date in the case is set for 1:30 p.m. June 16. Oklahoma sued 11 Arkansas poultry companies in 2005. A ruling found poultry litter from the farms supplying birds to those companies pollutes the Illinois River. The river flows from Northwest Arkansas through Oklahoma to the Arkansas River. The Illinois was named a protected scenic river by the Oklahoma Legislature in 1970 and was considered pristine at the time, according to the U.S. Geological Survey and other authorities. Phosphorus pollution has severely affected water quality and fish in the river, according to court testimony. The lawsuit's trial ended Sept. 24, 2009. Frizzell issued his ruling in the case in January. "I am absolutely content that they are negotiating in good faith," Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond told Frizzell about poultry companies at Friday's hearing. The parties could have asked for the 90-day continuance without a hearing but agreed it would be better to appear before the judge and show they were earnest in their talks. The case involves 11 named defendants including Tyson Foods Inc., Cargill Inc. and others. Neither Frizzell nor attorneys for the defendants guaranteed Frizzell negotiations would succeed but reported the negotiations were making progress. "It's a heaving lift," Drummond told the judge, with many issues to resolve in Frizzell's ruling, which runs for 214 pages. Frizzell did not mean to imply the task would be simple when he set a preliminary deadline of Friday to reach an agreement, the judge said from the bench. But he wants results, he said: "Something has to be done." "If I thought it would help to for you to don muck boots and clean sediment out of Tenkiller Lake, I'd consider it," Frizzell said. The Illinois flows into the lake before draining into the Arkansas River. Drummond will notify the court if negotiations falter, he assured the judge. "If this reaches the point of impasse you'll be the first to be notified," Drummond told the judge. Voluntary efforts have curtailed the release of phosphorus into the river, testing results from Arkansas and Oklahoma show and the January court ruling acknowledges. Further reduction is needed, the ruling says without specifying to what degree. Phosphorus from poultry litter is a key food for algae, and algae destroys water clarity and drains dissolved oxygen from water, Frizzell said. Frizzell's ruling criticized the current arrangements for controlling litter pollution as too informal. For instance, the ruling says the poultry companies tell growers to follow rules to prevent runoff of phosphorus from litter, but they make little effort to make sure those rules are followed. Neither side went into detail after the hearing about the status of negotiations, other than Drummond stating he wanted a special master. Under federal law a special master is designated by a judge to make sure court orders are followed. Drummond wants a special master because improving the river's water quality is a long-term matter, he said. "Any accord will not just be for remediation, but to go forward in improving water quality," Drummond said after the hearing. If negotiation fails he expects poultry companies to appeal Frizzell's ruling. If that happens he will also appeal Frizzell's pretrial decision that Oklahoma cannot seek monetary damages in the case. An attorney for the Cherokee Nation joined the attorney general's office at Friday's hearing, although Frizzell had not allowed the nation to join the original lawsuit as a co-plaintiff. The nation may not be a formal party to the suit but is still affected, Drummond said. The poultry companies and his office are using a 2003 agreement between the city of Tulsa and Arkansas companies as an example to follow in their negotiations, Drummond said. That case involved pollution of water in Lake Spavinaw and Lake Eucha. The most conservative estimate given in the trial of the amount of chicken litter produced by the defendants' operations was 354,000 tons in 2009. Litter consists of waste and the wood shavings or rice hulls spread on the floors of chicken houses to absorb that waste. Relief sought in the lawsuit includes curtailing runoff from litter. The relief could include restrictions on how much litter is used and how it can be applied in the watershed. Recommendations made by expert witnesses in the trial include removing all poultry litter outside the watershed, buffer strips to control runoff, excavation of phosphorus-laden soil, applying alum to fields to bind phosphorus there, stream bank stabilization and constructing wetlands.

         SILOAM SPRINGS -- Artist and Siloam Springs native Troy Anderson partnered with the Siloam Springs Museum to present an open house celebrating his art March 3. The event, which is one of the first events for the museum since the onset of the covid-19 pandemic, was a big success, according to museum officials. "There were over 50 people there, which is what we were hoping for. We're happy that we get to share art and history with the people of Siloam," said Don Warden, the museum's director of acquisitions. Anderson's exhibit featured multiple bronze sculptures that he had made, as well as some prints and paintings. "I'm very proud to be able to tell these important stories through my art," Anderson said. Anderson, who is part Cherokee, spoke about the historical figures and moments relating to Native American history that are depicted in his art. "There's a very rich history here, and it's something worth exploring, celebrating and using as fuel for artistic creation and expression," he said.

         A vice president at Ouachita Baptist University has been appointed to the Arkansas Ethics Commission by Senate President Pro Tempore Bart Hester, R-Cave Springs. Hester appointed Jason Tolbert of Arkadelphia to fill the commission post of Lori Klein of Searcy, whose five-year term has expired, Hester wrote in a letter to Tolbert dated March 6. Hester said Tolbert's five-year term on the commission will expire March 6, 2028. The Ethics Commission was established in 1991 with the passage of the Initiated Act of 1990. It enforces certain state laws on ethics, conflicts of interest, lobbying, campaigning, campaign finance and ballot questions. The other ethics commissioners include attorney Scott Irby of Little Rock, attorney Wendy Johnson of Springdale, dentist John Pitts of Little Rock, and banker Miguel Lopez of Little Rock. Hester said Friday that "My goal was to appoint someone that would show up to meetings and do the work. "Jason Tolbert has a long reputation understanding state government, of being reasonable, fair and firm," Hester said in a written statement. "I know Jason will add value to any organization he is part of, and I am grateful he is willing to serve the state in this capacity." Tolbert said Friday in a written statement that he's grateful to Hester for appointing him to this post. "I have always been fascinated by the political process especially at the state and local level, so I find the work of the Ethics Commission both interesting and important," he said. "Elections work best when voters are well informed about the candidates running for office and the issues they are voting on, including understanding how these campaigns are funded," Tolbert said. "I am looking forward to serving on the Ethics Commission whose mission serves an important role in this process. I hope my background as a Certified Public Accountant proves useful in this role." In a settlement of an ethics complaint filed by Tolbert, former Sen. Paul Bookout, D-Jonesboro, agreed in April 2014 to pay a $4,000 fine to the Arkansas Ethics Commission for four violations of state ethics laws during the 2010 election. Among other things, Bookout agreed with the commission's finding that he used a significant portion of his 2010 campaign funds and carryover funds to make expenditures for items not related to his campaign or office as a state senator. In a settlement of an ethics complaint filed by Tolbert, former state Rep. Hudson Hallum, D-Marion, agreed in December 2013 to pay a $2,500 fine to the commission and accept the commission's issuance of a public letter of caution and a public letter of warning for violating several state ethics laws during and after his 2011 special election campaign. Among other things, Hallum admitted he incorrectly reported a $50,000 contribution from his father as a bank loan to his campaign. Tolbert is vice president for finance, administrative services at Ouachita Baptist University, according to the university's web site. He previously was chief financial officer at Ouachita Baptist University. He is a certified public accountant and has served as controller for the Arkansas Baptist Foundation, as an associate at PricewaterhouseCoopers, as a staff accountant for Alltel Information Services and on the staff of the Arkansas Faith and Ethics Council before becoming Ouachita's chief financial officer in 2015, Ouachita Baptist University said in a news release about his appointment as vice president for finance in 2018. A native of Wynne, Tolbert earned a bachelor of science in education degree from Ouachita Baptist University and a master of business administration degree from the University of Arkansas at Little Rock.

         HIWASSE -- The quarterly meeting of the Benton County Historical Society was held March 12 at the Hiwasse Mercantile. Leah Whitehead, of Bella Vista, president of the society, welcomed members and guests and introduced Chris and Amanda (Fletcher) Flynt, owners of the recently renovated mercantile building. The Flynts opened the Hiwasse Mercantile store in the fall of 2022, but March 12 was the opening day of the adjacent meeting room. Whitehead praised the Flynts for the excellent job they did in restoring the historical building and said it was a "perfect example" of restoring a building and reusing it for a useful purpose. Amanda Flynt spoke briefly and noted that it was sad seeing the building falling down and she is thankful that she and her husband have been able to preserve "a lot of rich Hiwasse history" there. Flynt gave a brief biography of Virgil Banks, who owned and operated Hiwasse Produce and Grocery in the building and was also the depot agent at Hiwasse. She said she and Chris have plans for further improvements to the property, including landscaping and installation of additional parking on the north side of the building. Benton County native Larry Horton was the speaker for the society meeting and related an interesting history of Hiwasse. Horton, an author, Realtor and EMT, said he had deep roots in Hiwasse but left the area at an early age when his parents divorced. He gave a brief geological description of the area and read a short early history of the town. He said the hills were surrounded by beautiful prairies and noted that some early settlers were not always the most desirable, as many criminals from neighboring states came to the area to take advantage of the more tolerant residents. Many area buildings were burned during the Civil War, Horton said, and roads everywhere were terrible. Only after Reconstruction, between 1865 and 1890, were many small towns in the area developed. Land grants were awarded and many came to the area, including Horton's ancestors who homesteaded on what is now Arkansas 279. Tobacco was an early cash crop in the area. Many people came because there was an abundance of good timber in the area for building. A railroad was first proposed about 1853, but not until the Frisco railroad developed from Rogers in 1881 did the area finally open up. The town was first called Dickson, after Joseph Daniel Dickson, and was first located east of the present town. Dickson, three miles north of Spavinaw, was established on Aug. 7, 1871, and the name was changed to Hiwasse in 1899. Some residents wanted to call the town Big Spring, but there was already a Big Spring in the state, so they were unable to use that name. The railroad finally came to Hiwasse in 1898. Horton said there was a fight between Kansas City and Saint Louis as to which would put in the first rail line in the area. The area was known for its abundant fruit crops, and by 1906 Benton County was shipping the largest numbers of apples in the country. It was also the headquarters for Elberta peaches. Horton told about the Keith family, who grew many apple trees. The Keith farm consisted of 300 acres, 270 of which were planted in fruit trees. The apple business "went bust" by 1930 after aging orchards were damaged by insects, blight and other diseases. Horton gave an early description of the area, when Hiwasse consisted of four stores, including the Hiwasse Mercantile, and had a doctor, Dr. Horton, whose brother was also a doctor in nearby Pineville, Mo. He told about an attempted bank robbery on Dec. 1, 1911, when robbers blew up the entire bank building without being able to get into the vault. The business district burned down in 1913. Horton noted that the area produced some of great baseball players, including Bob Holloway and Gene Stephens, a Red Sox star player who long held the Major League record for making three hits in one inning. Horton related how Holloway was involved in some area robberies and in moon-shining and was arrested, although family members insisted he was innocent and was only covering for someone else. He was imprisoned for about a year until he was pardoned by the governor. "He was a better baseball player than he was a criminal," Horton said. Life in Hiwasse has always been laid back, Horton said, and he read a recent article he had written about his early memories attending the Hiwasse Christian Church, which is still much the same today. At that early date there were more churches than businesses in the area, Horton said, and the church was a favorite meeting place for neighbors and friends. There was no baptismal at the church, Horton added, and baptisms were held in Spavinaw Creek, so he suggested getting baptized in the summertime "or a person was going to have a pretty cold road to salvation." Horton remarked on good and bad times. "People did whatever they had to do to survive," he said. As the area continues to grow, residents don't know people like they used to and times are rapidly changing, he added. "We'll probably never again see the days of a railroad coming through town carrying loads of fruit for the national market, but sometimes lifetimes of memories are enough to keep a town alive," he concluded.

         While Washington County looks for a permanent home for its emergency services in Northwest Arkansas, officials in some of the state's largest counties say such a dedicated facility is essential. "Even smaller counties need someplace where people can work together during an emergency," Kendall Beam, director of emergency management for Sebastian County in west-central Arkansas, said. "It's a whole lot harder to do our jobs if we don't have a designated location for everyone to work from during emergencies." Washington County is moving ahead with a project to build a facility for its Department of Emergency Management. The department's offices are housed in space made available by the state Fire Academy at its training facility in Lincoln. Prior to that, the offices were in downtown Fayetteville, 105 N. Mill Ave., in what is now the Northwest Arkansas Crisis Stabilization Unit. Once it was decided the stabilization unit would be in that building, emergency services was moved to the County Annex building for a brief time in early 2019. That building was then designated as the location for a new circuit judge's offices and courtroom, and emergency services moved to Lincoln in November 2020. John Luther, Washington County's director of emergency management, said the county had outgrown the 5,000 square feet in what is now the Crisis Stabilization Unit and a new facility was becoming necessary even before the department moved out. He said the county needs to build with an eye on future growth as well as current needs. "If we had outgrown that 5,000 square feet, do we need 10,000 square feet now?" he said. "What about 10, 15 or 20 years from now?" Luther said the county needs a building "hardened" against most severe weather events, with secure communications facilities and an emergency power supply. The center should have conference rooms, training space and offices, as well as sleeping quarters, kitchen and bathroom facilities for use during prolonged emergency events. He said the county should design a building with room for expansion to avoid a lack of space in the future. "We don't want to be shortsighted in what we do," he said. Washington County Judge Patrick Deakins said Thursday the county has narrowed its search for a building site to the county's "South Campus," which also houses the Sheriff's Office and jail, the Juvenile Justice Center, the Road Department, the coroner's office and other county offices. Once a site is selected, Deakins said, the next step will be to ask the Quorum Court to approve money for architectural and engineering work on the building. Sebastian County shares an old National Guard armory building at 8400 S. Zero St. with the city of Fort Smith. Beam said the facility is in constant use for training and conferences in addition to its use in emergencies. "We can hold 24 people comfortably in our conference room," Beam said. "We have had as many as 60 people in there with it being standing-room only. It was like that during the 2019 flooding that we had." Beam said the facility has a radio system linked to the state's emergency communications system and also has a ham radio system available with a list of local radio operators who will work with the county if needed. There is a "policy room" for elected officials and others to use during emergencies separate from the main conference room. The building also houses training facilities for Fort Smith's Police and Fire departments. A county having its own emergency operations center is a positive thing, Beam said. "I have had every agency you can think of -- police and fire departments, local, state and federal agencies, the Red Cross, the Salvation Army, the United Way -- in our [center] during the pandemic, during floods, severe weather or any large-scale event. It works out better if you have a centralized location where everyone can work together." In Benton County, the emergency operations center is housed in the basement of the County Administration Building at 215 E. Central Ave. in Bentonville. Robert McGowan, the county's public safety administrator, said the center is adjacent to the Central Communications center and has a large conference room and some office space. With about 545 square feet of space now in use, McGowan said the county has seen the need for growth, but there are no plans for any changes in the near future. The space is constantly used for conferences and training, McGowan said, as well as emergency situations. The emergency operations center is used in severe weather and flooding events and was activated when thousands of protesters gathered on the nearby Bentonville square in the wake of George Floyd's death in 2020. "It's something that when you need it, you've got to have it," McGowan said. In Pulaski County in central Arkansas, the emergency operations center is housed in the county's Road and Bridge complex, according to Madeline Roberts, the county's director of communications. The Pulaski County center has about 1,000 square feet in the building, and Roberts said the location is adequate to house the department's eight employees. Roberts said the space is used during disasters and emergencies and is in daily use for training and conferences.

         A new facility and nursing program in Rogers aims to help address a need for health care providers in Northwest Arkansas. Leaders have pointed out that an increasing number of health care professionals will be needed to keep up with the demand of the region's burgeoning population. Over the next decade, registered nurses are projected to be among the top-growing occupations in Arkansas, according to the state Division of Workforce Services. Harding University's new accelerated bachelor of science in nursing program will train students for the health care workforce to meet this need, said Dr. Tina Wright, director of nursing services for the program. An initial class of six students began the program in January, she said. Students attend nursing simulation labs at a new training facility at 901 S. 52nd St. in addition to receiving online resources from Harding professors and participating in clinical rotations at Mercy Hospital. The university has renovated the second floor of its west Rogers building to include rooms for meeting, taking tests and practicing new skills. One room with six bed bays has several manikins to train students in a variety of nursing skills. Down the hall, a simulation room has a more advanced manikin -- nicknamed Mercy by the program -- which appears to blink, breathe and have a pulse. An operator can control the health conditions of the manikin and speak through its mouth from a nearby control room. Students can practice talking with their patient in a variety of simulated scenarios, including some emergency situations, which they may not usually be able to see in clinical rotations, Wright said. Operators can also record and replay a student's responses in the room, allowing for further teachable moments, she said. Harding joins several other nursing programs in the region. University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences opened a nurse training facility and its own accelerated nursing program at its Fayetteville campus last summer. That program is expected to add hundreds of nurses to the workforce over the next decade, said Patricia Cowan, dean and professor of the UAMS College of Nursing. The UAMS program is open to applicants with bachelor's or graduate degrees in any field, with certain general education and health science prerequisites. Other educational institutions in the area offer associate and bachelor's degrees in nursing, which are required for those wanting to become registered nurses. The University of Arkansas and John Brown University in Siloam Springs have eight-semester programs to complete a bachelor of science in nursing. Northwest Arkansas Community College offers a four-semester associate of applied science degree in nursing. The University of Arkansas at Fort Smith also has an eight-semester bachelor of science in nursing program. Barbara Johnson, of Bentonville, is one of the students enrolled at Harding. Johnson said she had been looking to earn an accelerated nursing degree, and the location of the facility and the school's reputation made the program appealing. The nature of the accelerated program, which allows students from different educational backgrounds to finish the nursing portion of the degree in as few as 16 months, will help Johnson transition from a previous career in law enforcement to a career in nursing. A bachelor's degree typically takes four years to earn. The program is open to applicants with 64 credits hours or more in liberal arts and prerequisite science courses such as anatomy, physiology and chemistry. Applicants can have a bachelor's degree in any field or can have taken college courses without obtaining a degree. The estimated cost of tuition and fees for the program is $54,296, according to the school's website. By 2025, the United States is expected to have a shortage of between 200,000 and 450,000 registered nurses, according to management consulting firm McKinsey & Co. To meet demand, the number of new graduates entering and staying in the nursing workforce would have to double every year for the next three years, a 2022 article by the firm states. Expanding educational opportunities and increasing the number of regional health care workers were among the recommendations included in a 2019 report published by the Northwest Arkansas Council, a nonprofit organization with members from the region's largest business, education and health care organizations. The 2019 report and recent analyses of Medicare data have estimated Northwest Arkansas residents spend hundreds of millions of dollars annually on health care outside the region. The data seems to show population growth in the region exceeded the health care system's capacity even before the covid-19 pandemic, said Dr. Joe Thompson, president and CEO of the Arkansas Center for Health Improvement.

         100 years ago March 20, 1923 J. Paul Reinhardt ... an evangelist by vocation but a tinsmith by trade ... was arrested yesterday morning by United States Deputy Marshal Dan Caldwell, charged with using the mails to defraud Mrs. Emma Thiela of West Lynn, Mass., of $2,000 in an oil deal at Bartlesville, Okla. 50 years ago March 20, 1973 Law enforcement officials Monday announced the confiscation of about $1.2 million in counterfeit $20 bills and about 12,000 counterfeit Arkansas driver's licenses, which they said were printed at the Mid-State Printing Company. ... Harold Duke, agent in charge of the Little Rock office of the Secret Service, said at a press conference that Eugene Wesley Howard ... owner of Mid-State, had been arrested Friday evening at McCain Mall for the alleged possession of about $300,000 of the counterfeit money. ... Duke said a fisherman had retrieved about $300,000 worth of the bills about two weeks ago from the Arkansas River, somewhere in Pulaski County. 25 years ago March 20, 1998 The U.S. 70 bridge over the White River near DeValls Bluff, struck by a barge Wednesday, will be closed two or three months for repairs, the state Department of Highway and Transportation said Thursday. Department officials made the estimate after inspecting the damage Thursday morning. That may change if an underwater inspection shows more damage, department spokesman Randy Ort said. A barge broke loose from a tug Wednesday and slammed into the 74-year-old structure, which the department considers so functionally obsolete that a $13 million contract has been let to replace it. The barge, which broke from the tug after striking a railroad bridge above the U.S. 70 bridge, caused "considerable damage" to a pier supporting the bridge deck, department officials said. The department never considered not repairing the span because it is an important crossing, Ort said. The new bridge will not open for at least two years. 10 years ago March 20, 2013 FORT SMITH -- Environmental activist Erin Brockovich is scheduled to visit Fort Smith next week to investigate Whirlpool Corp.'s contamination of groundwater in a neighborhood in the city's south and attend a town hall meeting of the neighbors. Brockovich, who gained fame by successfully taking on Pacific Gas and Electric in a groundwater-contamination court case in the 1990s, will attend the meeting 6 p.m. Tuesday at the Fort Smith Senior Activity Center at Cavanaugh Road and South 28th Street. Brockovich, who is now president of Brockovich Research and Consulting in Southern California, decided to visit Fort Smith after one resident of the neighborhood, Debbie Keith ... wrote to her about the contamination of her neighborhood's groundwater with trichloroethylene, a hazardous degreaser Whirlpool used for years to clean metal parts in its refrigerator manufacturing operation. It used the chemical from 1967 to 1981, according to the company.  Print Headline: Other days Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         NLR man is held after police chase A man was arrested in Little Rock on Friday after police say he led officers on a chase in a vehicle and on foot and was found to have drugs and a stolen gun. Alex Nichols, 24, of North Little Rock was arrested at 5:21 p.m. after officers attempted to pull over the Honda Accord he was driving because of a "reasonable suspicion" that its tinted windows were too dark, according to an arrest report. The location of the arrest was redacted from the report provided at the Pulaski County jail. The Accord took off, running multiple stop signs before Nichols got out and ran away, the report says. Police caught Nichols, "assisted" him to the ground and took him into custody within 1,000 feet of two churches, the report says. A search of Nichols turned up a "large sum of cash" and a loaded 9mm Springfield XD9 pistol, which had been reported stolen, in his pants pocket, the report says. In the car, police reported finding two baggies of "green leafy matter," two green pills, 10 blue pills, four white pills, two digital scales and a large number of plastic baggies. Police said they also learned that Nichols is a felon with a suspended driver's license. Nichols faces four counts of drug possession and one count each of simultaneous possession of drugs and a firearm, possession of drug paraphernalia, possession of a firearm by a certain person and theft by receiving -- all felonies. He also faces a potential sentence enhancement related to possessing drugs within 1,000 feet of a church, the report says. Nichols also faces misdemeanor charges of resisting arrest, fleeing on foot and reckless driving and was cited for having improper window tint and driving on a suspended license. Man says robber shot gun at him A man told police a man fired a gun at him during an attempted robbery at a southwest Little Rock apartment complex early Thursday. The 66-year-old victim, who lives at Bella Vista Apartments, told police he met with someone at the complex about 5 a.m. to buy something. The victim said the seller told him to follow him, then pulled out a handgun and demanded his property. The victim said he argued with the gunman, who then reached into the victim's pockets and grabbed items. The gunman then started walking away, dropping the items, before firing at the victim, striking three nearby vehicles. The victim said the robber then ran east through the parking lot.

        A Little Rock man who pleaded guilty to distribution of 157 grams of fentanyl last August was sentenced Friday to 19 years and 2 months in federal prison. Josh Wiley, 30, was named in a superseding indictment in September 2020, charged with conspiracy to distribute fentanyl and cocaine and two counts of distribution of fentanyl. Wiley pleaded guilty to one count of distribution of fentanyl before U.S. District Judge James M. Moody Jr. last August in exchange for the dismissal of the remaining counts against him. Four others were also named in the indictment: three on cocaine conspiracy and distribution counts and one on conspiracy to distribute cocaine and fentanyl, cocaine distribution and weapons charges. According to his plea agreement, on Aug. 29, 2019, agents with the Drug Enforcement Administration in Little Rock arranged for a confidential source to purchase heroin from Wiley for $4,000. According to the plea agreement, Wiley met the confidential source at a location on Stagecoach Road in southwest Little Rock to make the sale. When the drugs were examined at the DEA crime lab, the plea agreement said, it was discovered that Wiley had sold the confidential source 60 grams of fentanyl. Between May 31 and Aug. 29, 2019, the plea agreement said, the DEA purchased 157 grams of fentanyl from Wiley. Wileys attorney, Theodis Thompson of Little Rock, asked Moody to consider a downward departure of Wileys guideline sentencing range of 188 months to 235 months in prison. “Mr. Wiley has two prior convictions that make him a career offender,” Thompson said. “One of those was for possession of marijuana with intent to distribute when Mr. Wiley was 18 years of age, and that was over 12 years ago … Its not Mr. Wileys intent to make light of this prior conviction, however, today marijuana is widely used and accepted.” Thompson pointed out that two of Wileys co-defendants had been sentenced to far lower prison terms. Phillip Smith, the lead defendant, was sentenced to 10 years for cocaine distribution and a firearms charge. Terrance Spreads received a 51-month sentence for cocaine distribution. A third defendant, Lonnie Smith, pleaded guilty to cocaine distribution but has not yet been sentenced. A fourth defendant, Kawanis Redmon, died in November. Thompson said Wiley had a harsh upbringing, pointing out in a sentencing memorandum that Wileys brother was shot to death in 2008 and his father died in 2014. Wiley, speaking hesitantly, apologized to Moody for his actions, telling the judge that he had gotten away from criminal activities and had started a trucking business. “I understand what I did was very bad,” he said. “I been quit doing that before I even got indicted. I wasnt dealing with the same folks … I changed a lot, I kind of started me a business with trucking. I understand you got a job to do. I just ask that you be merciful to me … I understand I put poison in the community and that wasnt a good decision at all. I just ask for your mercy.” Assistant U.S. Attorney Stacy Williams argued in favor of a guideline sentence, due, she said, to the dangerous nature of fentanyl. “The DEA went through the lead defendant to buy heroin,” she said. “They were introduced to Mr. Wiley to buy heroin, but what he sold them was fentanyl. That is how people die.” Williams said the deadly nature of fentanyl requires the government to take a hardline stance on trafficking of the drug. According to the DEA, fentanyl — a powerful synthetic opioid some 50 times more potent than heroin and 100 times more potent than morphine — can be lethal in doses as small as two milligrams. “He dealt enough fentanyl to the DEA to kill every person in this courthouse,” she said. “The only way to deter people from dealing fentanyl is to have harsh sentences. The United States believes this guideline sentence is correct in this case.” Moody noted that even without an official designation as a career criminal, Wileys criminal history fit the profile, noting that from the age of 18, he had amassed convictions for residential burglary, marijuana distribution, possession of firearms by certain persons at age 22, felon in possession of a firearm at the age of 25 and a second marijuana conviction at age 26. “Here we are at age 30,” Moody said. “When he committed the instant offense … he was still serving a sentence when he was caught on three multiple buys … I think that puts him in a completely different posture than his co-defendants.” I n ad d i t i o n to t h e 230-month prison sentence, Moody ordered Wiley to serve four years on supervised release after he leaves prison.

         Editor's note: The Arkansas Department of Health is changing how it labels violations. During this process, both newer and older terms may appear. Violations marked as priority contribute directly to the elimination, prevention or reduction in the hazards associated with foodborne illness. Priority violations include prevention of contamination, cooking, reheating, cooling, and handwashing. Priority foundation rules support, facilitate or enable one or more priority items.

         FAYETTEVILLE -- A local group wants to help bridge the divide among residents on planning issues and guide city policy on streets, housing, parking and development patterns. DeLani Bartlette, a resident who works at the University of Arkansas, has spearheaded an effort to start a local Strong Towns group. Strong Towns is a national advocacy organization seeking to create safe, livable and inviting communities by replacing suburban, post-war development patterns with more traditional, walkable mixed-use areas, according to its website. The city already has adopted many of those kinds of policies, but bringing those plans to fruition can take years, Bartlette said. Residents should become more engaged in city planning to help speed the process along, she said. "The main gist should be to become a ground-up, grassroots type of organization," Bartlette said. Rather than chapters, Strong Towns encourages residents to form "local conversation" groups. The organization lists more than 120 such groups throughout the country on its website. Bartlette said she was surprised to find out Fayetteville didn't already have its own group. The city is her hometown, and she said she wants to see it become a more walkable, bikeable and equitable place. Strong Towns supports "local conversation" groups with listings on its website, contact information, online articles and academic courses. The organization produces videos, one of which is titled "Are Parking Lots Ruining Your City?" and is about Fayetteville doing away with parking minimums for businesses to make room for more buildings downtown. Justin Tennant, a former City Council member and current member of the board for the Walton Arts Center, said sometimes urbanist ways of thought can overlook a city's unique conditions. For instance, the Walton Arts Center and other businesses in the entertainment district commissioned a parking study for downtown, set to be released next month. The city paid for a mobility study in 2017 that included a downtown parking analysis concluding there was ample parking supply. However, spaces were counted regardless of whether they were private or residential, and the study didn't adequately address the busiest times, Tennant said. "It seems to me there's a tendency to believe all cities and downtowns are the same and a one-size-fits-all approach should work everywhere," he said. "I would rather look at each area on its own, then look at our region in Northwest Arkansas." The city's planning policies need to evolve with its growth and include residential groups from all sides of issues, Tennant said. Bartlette hosted the group's first meeting Wednesday at Crisis Brewing. Several urban planning enthusiasts and professionals were there, and she spent time networking and trying to get the word out. Bartlette advertised the meetup on the Facebook group she started, Fayetteville Strong. A few people Bartlette talked to spoke of ideas such as incremental change to address specific issues, a tenet of Strong Towns. They also talked about the value of urban land, recommended books to one another and discussed different conferences coming up. Keaton Smith, a member of the School Board and city planning advocate, said he hoped to use his connections within local, regional and national planning organizations to help grow the Strong Towns group. However, residents pushing for change in their own neighborhoods would make the most impact, he said. "I think Strong Towns is about finding that next step of small, incremental change that is right for your community," Smith said. "Ideally, that is not top-down from experts and politicians. It's bottom-up from residents who know their neighborhood and know their neighbors and see an opportunity to make something better." Residents often agree on the same goals for their community, Smith said. Those goals can include safe streets, a vibrant downtown and reducing traffic jams. It's just that people may have different ideas on how to accomplish those goals, he said. Strong Towns has five priorities: ending highway expansion, keeping local government finances transparent, incrementally increasing housing density, creating safe streets and ending parking mandates, according to its website. Every "local conversation" group has different priorities unique to its community, said John Pattison, community builder with Strong Towns. The organization is nonpartisan and welcomes residents of different political ideologies, he said. Although Fayetteville has adopted many of the policies for which Strong Towns advocates, the work to make a city better never ends, Pattison said. "Fayetteville could be a model. Many towns and cities don't want to go first," he said. "They want to be able to point to other leaders in places like Fayetteville for their constituents." Shane Guenther, a senior civil engineering student at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, started an urbanism club at the school last year with support from Strong Towns. He said the group has been focusing on education and advocacy for local planning policies. The group hosts weekly meetings and invites speakers to talk about the concepts Strong Towns typically supports. Members routinely interact with city officials and show up to City Hall to express support for rezoning to higher residential density and walkable streets, he said. Neighbors often show up to City Council meetings as a united front against a rezoning, Guenther said. Residents who want higher density rezonings typically don't express their support to elected officials, he said. "We really want to be the voice of the people who then will be able to move in," Guenther said. "It's hard for someone to advocate for an apartment building that they don't live in yet." Ann Arbor is in the middle of updating a vision plan for the city, and Guenther said his group plans to keep the momentum going for urbanist policies. "All we want is just to be able to walk to a restaurant or a bar or a park, some kind of social space, and walk back without worrying about getting hit by a car," Guenther said. "When you frame it like that, people are a lot more receptive."  None  Strong Towns The national Strong Towns organization has a four-step process for coming up with community solutions: Humbly observe where people in the community struggle. Ask the question: What is the next smallest thing we can do right now to address that struggle? Do that thing. Repeat.

        LITTLE ROCK, Ark. — Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders has signed a new law that will allow a monument near the state Capitol marking the number of abortions performed in Arkansas before the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade. Sanders' office said Friday night that the Republican governor signed the bill that will allow the creation of a privately funded "monument to the unborn" on the Capitol grounds. The bill, approved by lawmakers last week, requires the secretary of state to permit and arrange the placement of the monument. It also requires the Capitol Arts and Grounds Commission to oversee the selection of the artist and the design of the monument, with input from anti-abortion groups. A law Arkansas approved in 2019 banning nearly all abortions took effect last year when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the 1973 Roe decision. Arkansas' ban only allows abortions to save the life of the mother in a medical emergency. Tennessee lawmakers approved legislation in 2018 allowing a similar privately funded monument on its Capitol grounds. The monument has not yet been installed. Arkansas' proposal faced opposition from some anti-abortion Republicans who said it was counterproductive, and Democrats who said the monument proposal was divisive. Other monuments on the state Capitol grounds include a sculpture of the nine Black students who integrated Little Rock Central High School. A Ten Commandments monument was installed on the Capitol grounds in 2018. Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        ROGERS -- The search for a father and son who went missing on Beaver Lake stretched into its third day Saturday with no news of the men being found. Chuck Morris, 47, and his son Charley Morris, 20, both of Kansas City, Mo., were reported missing about 4 p.m. Thursday, according to Lt. Shannon Jenkins, a spokeswoman for the Benton County Sheriff's Office. A family member told officials the men had gone kayaking about 11 a.m. Thursday and were expected to return by 2 p.m. that day, Jenkins said. Sheriff's Office deputies began searching Beaver Lake in the Lost Bridge area Thursday afternoon. The Sheriff's Office did not provide an update on the search Saturday. Chuck Morris is a percussionist for the band Lotus, described as an instrumental electronic jam band on the group's Wikipedia page. In a post on its Facebook page Saturday, the band stated: "We have no new information at the moment. A friend of the family has started a GoFundMe drive to provide financial support to Chuck's immediate family." That GoFundMe page at gofund.me/bd9a1acf had attracted more than $26,000 in donations as of 5:30 p.m. Saturday. Sheriff's Office deputies found one of the Morris' kayaks Thursday night. The other kayak was found Friday morning, Jenkins said. A jacket that one of the men had been wearing was found in an area between the kayaks, she said. A prayer vigil for the men was held Saturday afternoon at Lost Bridge.  Print Headline: No sign of two missing Beaver Lake kayakers Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders' education overhaul legislation that raises the state's minimum teacher salary from $36,000 to $50,000 a year, creates Educational Freedom Accounts to help students attend private schools, parochial schools or to home school, and enacts many other changes in the education system. It's Act 237 of 2023. The Legislature and Sanders still have to enact a Revenue Stabilization Act that prioritizes the distribution of state general revenue in fiscal year 2024 that begins July 1, and determine what to do with $1.3 billion in unallocated general revenue surplus funds. Lawmakers also will grapple with whether to refer up to three proposed constitutional amendments to voters in the 2024 general election. Lawmakers also want to complete action on a wide variety of measures. Sanders spokeswoman Alexa Henning said Friday night that Sanders "signed the biggest, most transformational education reform in the nation into law [on March 8]. "She is pleased to have worked with her partners in the legislature to enact a bold agenda that is delivering on the promises she made," Henning said in a written statement. "She continues to work with them on passing a budget that reflects the values she has been talking about for the last two years," Henning said. "She is confident that the outcome will prioritize education investments, public safety, and reductions to the income tax." Regarding the state's Revenue Stabilization Act for fiscal 2024, a Joint Budget Committee co-chairman, Sen. Jonathan Dismang, R-Searcy, said Thursday that "I think at this point I am ready to start digging in and throwing numbers in, even if we're maybe not ready on all levels at this point. "But I think that it is time to put numbers on paper," he said. "I think we have a good idea where we are with [educational] adequacy, which is kind of the missing piece, and I'd anticipate some movement," Dismang said. "While we are out for break, I will be working on it and then when we get back ready to start having some real conversations with members." Dismang said legislative leaders have discussed budget priorities with Sanders' administration. "I think it is a legislative function to put out RSA and we take that seriously," he said. "So we absolutely will be taking into account some things they'd like to be considered." For the state's Department of Corrections, "we have got to look in the short term at what it is going to cost to staff up the beds and provide proper staffing levels at our current system," Dismang said. "The parole reform won't really start having a large impact [until] year three, four, five and on, so it is not as pertinent to what we are doing with this year's RSA," he said. In November, then-Gov. Asa Hutchinson proposed a $314 million increase in the state's general revenue budget to $6.33 billion in fiscal 2024, starting July 1, 2023, with $200 million of the increased general revenue earmarked for the public schools. At that time, the former Republican governor said his proposed budget for fiscal 2024 would represent a 5.2% increase over the current budget of $6.02 billion, leaving a projected general revenue surplus of $254.9 million at the end of fiscal year 2024. Considering inflation was more than 8% last year, limiting the growth of the state's general revenue budget to 5.2% reflects conservative budgeting, he said. The state Department of Education has projected Sanders' education overhaul law, Act 237, will cost $297.5 million, including $150 million in "new money" in fiscal 2024. Senate President Pro Tempore Bart Hester, R-Cave Springs, said a consensus hasn't been reached yet "where we are all holding hands" on how much state funding is needed to provide an adequate education to public school students. "It is so close it is almost negligible at this point," he said. Rep. Lane Jean, R-Magnolia, who is a co-chairman of the Legislative Budget Committee, said that "I am just waiting for the bottom line number for the foundation funding [per student] and I think that's what they are working on." PUBLIC SAFETY Sen. Ben Gilmore, R-Crossett, who is working with Rep. Jimmy Gazaway, R-Paragould, on the public safety legislation, reiterated Friday that he expects the legislation to be filed the week after the Legislature returns from its spring break March 27. Gazaway said Friday "the issue is not that we don't have the policy ready and that the bill is not ready. "It is. Really now the issue is how much can we devote toward [prison] capacity," he said. "Part of what I think we have understood is that this is a long-term issue. What we'll do this session will likely be the first step in what will be multiple sessions of addressing this issue. The problem with capacity wasn't created overnight and we are not going to solve it overnight." House Speaker Matthew Shepherd, R-El Dorado, said Thursday he's focused on the long-awaited public safety legislation as well as tax reduction legislation, the state's Revenue Stabilization Act, and proposed constitutional amendments. He said discussions over the cost of the public safety bill are still ongoing, and "it gets back into working through in some way looking at what else is out there from an RSA perspective." Hester said Thursday "we know that we have to pay our corrections officers more. "We know that we got to do truth-in-sentencing," he said. "The reality is on the truth-in-sentencing is how much are we going to do. The governor's office wants to see some more mental health [programs] in there, so we are really working towards that. These are issues that we all agree on." INCOME TAX CUTS Jean said Thursday there has been nothing settled yet on an income tax cut. "[But] I am smart enough to know this, the two things [Gov. Sanders] ran on was education and tax cuts," he said. "Now it may be one-tenth of 1% or two-tenths of 1%, but there will be a tax cut coming out of this session because those are the two main things she ran," Jean said. "Hey, I know enough about politics I know that those two things are going to happen. Everything else can fall through the woodwork." Shepherd said "I wouldn't say there's necessarily a number per se about what those tax cuts would entail." "I think there's ongoing discussions about the reduction, of what those reductions look like as far as off the top rate is primarily where the discussion looks like," he said. The state's top individual income tax rate is 4.9%. The state's' top corporate income tax rate is 5.3% State Department of Finance and Administration spokesman Scott Hardin said that "While we don't have a formal revenue impact for a reduction of the top rate to 4.7%, we do know the following based on previous research: Between 4.9% and 4.0%, the reduction of each tenth of a percent represents approximately $50 million in revenue." STATE EMPLOYEE PAY Sanders announced Wednesday that she will not support a broad-based pay plan increase in state government's employee classification and compensation bill. In a letter to state Transformation and Shared Services Secretary Joseph Wood, the governor wrote that Arkansas taxpayers should not be saddled with the $80 million price tag for such a proposal that doesn't consider the strategic needs in education, public safety, health care and corrections. "Today, I am directing the Department of Transformation and Shared Services to review and rework the existing classification and compensation structure of the state," Sanders wrote in her letter. "Arkansas should not have more state employees per capita than all our surrounding states. It's long past time to reduce the size and scope of government, identify efficiencies, and responsibly phase out the income tax." John Bridges, executive director of the Arkansas State Employees Association, said Thursday that " we are very discouraged to learn that Governor Sanders has declined to implement the reevaluation of the state employees' pay plan, which is estimated to cost $41 million" in general revenue. "It has been seven years since the last time the salary ranges for state employees have been adjusted and our members have been anxiously awaiting the announced revised pay plan, which was developed after a comprehensive study by the Office of Personnel Management," he said in a written statement. "We hear from agency managers that the failure to update the pay plan has made it difficult to recruit and retain talented employees, especially when the pay is already much lower than private business," Bridges said. "We look forward to working with Governor Sanders to find solutions that will fit with her strategic priorities while recognizing the hard work of 23,000 state employees all over the state." The state's unallocated general revenue allotment reserve balance is $1.34 billion, according to Hardin. The state's catastrophic reserve fund balance is $1.36 billion, he said, and the state's restricted reserve fund balance is $55.37 million. In addition, the state Department of Finance and Administration's Nov. 10 forecast projects a general revenue surplus of $598.1 million at the end of fiscal 2023. END OF SESSION Monday will be the 71st day of the 94th General Assembly's regular session. The Arkansas House and Senate have approved a resolution for the chambers to recess that started Thursday with lawmakers returning on March 27 as well as a resolution to extend the regular session beyond 60 days and to recess April 7 or at an earlier date agreed upon by the House and Senate. It would require a three-fourths vote of the 100-member House of Representatives and the 35-member Senate to extend the regular session beyond April 7. April 7 would be the 89th day of the regular session, April 14 would be the 96th day of the regular session, April 21 would be the 103rd day of the regular session, and April 28 would be the 110th day of the regular session. The regular session lasted 118 days in 2021 and was 30 days longer than the 88-day regular session in 2019. The regular session lasted 86 days in 2017 and 82 days in 2015. As April 7 approaches, Shepherd said Thursday that House members would have to be flexible and may have to meet on Fridays to consider legislation. So far, the House and Senate haven't met on a Friday throughout this year's regular session. Shepherd told reporters he believes it's still possible to wrap up the regular session in April. "But every day that goes by obviously makes it more of a challenge," Shepherd said. Hester said "the goal is April 7th. "We are going to keep our desk open through the week of spring break so members can still file bills so that when we show up Monday next week we can go to work," he said. Some lawmakers doubt it's realistic to wrap up the regular session on April 7. Sen. Linda Chesterfield, D-Little Rock, said she is not confident lawmakers can complete their business by April 7. Legislative leaders "seem to be very confident that that's going to happen," she said. "I am still waiting on a budget, and we haven't done [the Revenue Stabilization Act]. "Perhaps leadership has something going that I don't know about, but they continue to say it's going to be April 7th, so I am hopeful that they are telling us the truth," Chesterfield said.

         CENTERTON -- A convicted sex offender operated a halfway house for parolees and probationers in rural Benton County where authorities said he assaulted one of the participants. Federal, state and local law enforcement served a search warrant at the facility Jan. 20. By the time they left, five residents had been arrested on various charges, including drugs and weapons counts. The founder and director, Thomas Hartman, is facing felony charges of sexual assault in the third degree and being a felon in possession of a firearm. Hartman wasn't required to obtain a state license for the Wings of Peace ministry, a self-described sober transitional living facility, but he called Arkansas Adult Probation and Parole to tell them he intended to apply, according to spokeswoman Dina Tyler. "Community Correction knew this place existed and was deeply involved with the raid. Any time several parolees live at the same address, it raises a red flag. Sometimes it's totally innocent. For instance, several parolees living in the same apartment complex," Tyler said. "We are always looking for operations like Wings [of] Peace. It can take a while to find them, but at some point, we will." Hartman was a lay minister, according to Jonathan Watson, who was a Wings of Peace board member. Watson said he became involved in Wings of Peace because Hartman was a friend. He said he only became aware of problems at Wings of Peace when Hartman was arrested. "This situation is terrible in what happened and the unfolding consequences of it. Just awful. There's not a person in the world that's going to come to Tom's defense and I'm not, either," Watson said. "He is going to have to deal with the reality of the choices that he made." Hartman's wife, Janice, gave police a membership certification from the Revival Ministries International Ministerial Association which listed her husband as the Rev. Thomas Hartman. Men living in the center often referred to him as reverend and he occasionally preached sermons, Thomas Hartman told police. Hartman is accused of using his position as a member of the clergy to engage in sexual acts with a 23-year-old man who was living at Wings of Peace, according to court documents. Hartman is a Level 3 sex offender. Level 3 offenders have a history of repeat offenses or strong antisocial, violent or predatory personality characteristics, requiring notification throughout the community, according to state law. Sen. Missy Irvin, R-Mountain View, serves as chairwoman of the state Senate's Public Health, Welfare and Labor Committee. Irvin confirmed there's no licensing requirement for such facilities unless they accept state taxpayer money, such as Medicaid payments or vouchers for child care. Part of the reason for the lack of oversight, she said, was constitutionally guaranteed freedom for organizations with a religious affiliation. Sen. Tyler Dees, R-Siloam Springs, and Rep. Hope Hendren Duke, R-Gravette, both represent western Benton County. Both said they have asked legislative staff to check regulations on halfway houses and report back to them on possible ways to prevent such situations in the future. Wings of Peace claimed to be a faith-based facility but didn't list a specific religious affiliation. Residents were supposed to pay the Hartmans $125 per month to help with the bills and continue in the program, but Janice Hartman told police most didn't because they had no money. UNDER THE RADAR Tyler said Wings of Peace never reached the point of applying to be licensed by the state. It's common, she said, for would-be operators to call and tell Community Correction they want to open a house and plan to file an application. "Our reentry officers found out he's a sex offender and the process stopped," Tyler said of Hartman. "They checked out his facility and him. So, his verbal intent to apply was as far as the application process got." Hartman was convicted of sexual assault in the second degree of a child in Wisconsin in 1997 and was given a suspended sentence with probation. Within months, he violated his probation for having unsupervised contact with a minor, and he was incarcerated from January 1998 through September 2003. He moved to Arkansas in 2018 and registered with the Sex Offender Notification Assessment Program, which assigned him a community-notification Level 3, which was affirmed by the Sex Offender Assessment Committee after Hartman requested an administrative review. Hartman appealed to the Pulaski County Circuit Court, which also affirmed. In September 2021, an Arkansas Court of Appeals panel affirmed the committee on appeal. Prosecutors in both Benton and Washington counties said they were not aware of Wings of Peace until it came to the attention of law enforcement. "I don't know anything about them," said Nathan Smith, Benton County prosecuting attorney. "Obviously, we partner with Ozark Guidance. I was not familiar with Wings of Peace. I'd never heard of them." Ozark Guidance/Arisa Health is licensed by the state to provide mental health and addiction counseling in Northwest Arkansas. "I would think there's some sort of accrediting agency. I don't know who would do that, but there's got to be some sort of accreditation-type stuff. They are not to my knowledge under the umbrella of the state," Smith said of Wings of Peace. Libby Bier, Ozark Guidance/Arisa Health director of recovery services, said there are state licensing requirements for treatment centers -- even ones that don't take Medicaid -- but not for things like "safe houses" or alcohol-safe residential programs. "I don't know what they were licensed for, or if they weren't, then there wouldn't be any accrediting body or anything that would oversee them," Bier said. Bier said Ozark Guidance is a referral source for the Arkansas Department of Corrections when someone is released from prison who needs mental health or substance abuse treatment. Wings of Peace was active for less than a year. Bier said that could be one reason little is known about the organization. Bier said she doesn't recall Wings of Peace reaching out to build relationships with the licensed and accredited organizations. "They weren't attending any of the coalitions or any of that that I'm familiar with either," she said. "There's a network of us. You build that relationship through being licensed. The state holds meetings for those of us that have a contract with the state." The Arkansas Department of Health's Arkansas State Board of Examiners of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Counselors said it had never licensed Thomas Hartman or his wife as counselors. The Arkansas Substance Abuse Certification Board said it had never certified either of the Hartmans. ASSAULT ALLEGATION Hartman and his wife founded Wings of Peace NWA. Records show the couple bought the 13.76-acre property at 1470 Shipe Road, west of Centerton, for $375,000 in November 2021. Buildings on the land can barely be seen from the dirt road because of the number of trees. There's a gate, a mailbox and cedar posts that once held a sign. One building on the property can house 12 to 16 men, according to a probable cause affidavit. There's also a 2,200-square-foot house the Hartmans lived in. One probationer lived in the family home at no cost, according to the affidavit. The man told authorities he met Hartman four or five years ago and considered him a father figure, according to the affidavit. The man said Hartman had engaged in sexual acts with him a few times, the affidavit says. The man said he felt trapped because he was required to live at the location because Hartman had bonded him out. If he left, he knew Hartman would turn him in, the affidavit states. He believed Hartman would have kicked him out if he did not comply with the sexual contact, the affidavit states. Hartman admitted in his interview with investigators to engaging in sex acts with the man several times, but said he thought the contact was consensual, according to the affidavit. Hartman is charged with third-degree sexual assault in Benton County Circuit Court. He entered an innocent plea at his arraignment Feb. 28. The men staying at Wings of Peace were mostly middle-aged with histories of substance abuse. The ministry was incorporated with the state on May 7, 2021, and the nonprofit recognition with the IRS as a 501(c)3 was granted in October 2021, according to information that had been on the organization's website. The incorporation is now listed by the Arkansas secretary of state as not current. Watson said he believes Hartman's intent was to reach out and help others in need because of his own past problems. "The idea of it was a sober living community. I think that's the best way to sort of wrap it up, post-incarceration of men who had been disenfranchised from their families because of all different sorts of self-defeating behaviors," Watson said. "And so the idea was to have a safe place for them to be able to overcome their hurt, habits and hangups, the end result hopefully being able to successfully live in society and in their own families." But, Watson said, he thinks the inner demons Hartman struggled with got the better of him with terrible results and still unfolding consequences. "The internal challenges that he faced became external challenges, and those choices that he made blew up the life that he was hoping to live and the work that he was hoping to do and now all of that is done because of the choices that he made," Watson said. Watson said Wings of Peace has been disbanded and he and another former board member are liquidating the assets by donating them to other ministries and closing out the 501(c)3. After the arrests, the only message on the website stated, "Wings of Peace is no longer providing any sober living services. Please reach out to other organizations for assistance."

         At least three bills intended to shield professionals ranging from Little League umpires to police officers from harm by stiffening state criminal law are working their way through the Arkansas Legislature. House Bill 1496, which aims to safeguard athletic officials from physical abuse, and House Bill 1561, which seeks to add charges for drivers who injure or kill road workers, passed the House last week with broad support and are bound for the Senate. The House Committee on Judiciary is expected to continue its consideration of House Bill 1521, which would create a criminal penalty for disarming a law enforcement officer, after the Legislature returns from its spring break March 27. By creating new charges that prosecutors could use alongside existing penalties, sponsors said their bills would help deter people from harming officials. In some instances, however, lawmakers have expressed concerns about singling out certain groups for special protection under the law and placing additional charges on defendants who may already be facing extended sentences. Rep. RJ Hawk, who is sponsoring HB1496, told the House on Thursday that his bill would help protect athletic officials at the Little League, high school and collegiate levels. He said an official in Mountain Home was hospitalized after being struck by a fan at a basketball game roughly a year ago. "These guys make $60 to $70 [a game]. It's a part-time job for most of them, and so we want to have some protections for them," said Hawk, R-Bryant. While drafting the offenses included in the current version of the bill, Hawk said he worked closely with members of the House Committee on Judiciary. Under the bill, a person who purposely "creates apprehension of imminent physical injury in an athletic contest official" would be guilty of a Class A misdemeanor. [DOCUMENT: Read the bills boosting criminal laws » arkansasonline.com/319shields/] Someone who causes physical injury to an official with the purpose of causing physical injury would be guilty of a Class A misdemeanor with a minimum fine of $2,500. A person who causes serious physical injury to an official with the intent to cause physical injury would be guilty of a Class C felony. Under state law, a Class C felony is punishable by between three and 10 years in prison. The bill would apply a Class B felony if a person causes serious physical injury to an athletic official with the purpose of causing serious physical injury. A Class B felony conviction carries a sentence between five and 20 years. Rep. Jimmy Gazaway, R-Paragould, told the House the offense which would carry a Class B felony was in line with existing law while the offense that would carry a Class C felony represented an enhancement. The $2,500 fine associated with the misdemeanor penalty for acting with the purpose of causing physical injury also would be an enhancement, Gazaway said. "I think it's a well-reasoned bill," he told House members. To ensure fans are aware of the penalties, Hawk said the Arkansas Activities Association would inform each of its member schools of the measure. Hawk said he had already begun discussing the bill in Saline County and reached out to tournament directors around the state who said they would post notices of the new penalties at games. Rep. David Ray, R-Maumelle, asked why people who abuse athletic officials should be subject to stiffer penalties than people who abuse any other person. Hawk pointed to a state and nationwide shortage of athletic officials and said that adding protections could help with recruitment and retention. He noted 22 other states have enacted protections for athletic officials and said organizations representing officials in Arkansas had requested the legislation. A survey conducted last year by the National Federation of State High School Associations indicated that roughly 50,000 people had stopped serving as high school athletic officials since the 2018-2019 season. The bill passed the House with a vote of 75-4 with nine lawmakers voting present. The Senate has referred the bill to its Committee on Judiciary. Ray, who voted against the bill, said during an interview Friday he generally opposes creating any enhanced penalties for special groups of people. "As best as possible, the law ought to apply to folks equally," he said. Rep. Nicole Clowney, D-Fayetteville, who also cast a vote against the bill, said Friday she always wants to ensure the policy reasons for extra protections justify the enhanced penalties. She noted that during the 2021 regular session lawmakers were unwilling to create enhanced penalties to protect minority and LGBTQ groups that have been frequent targets of hate crimes. Instead, legislators passed a bill that would allow prosecutors to seek longer prison terms for violent criminals who target anyone in a "recognizable and identifiable group." The bill, signed into law by former Gov. Asa Hutchinson, would require defendants convicted of such a crime to serve 80% of their sentences before being eligible for parole. "If we're going to increase the number of special classes, I would say groups like athletic officials, while of course I don't want them to be victims of violence, certainly wouldn't be at the top of my list for people who deserve special protections," Clowney said. "I think that the protections that those people are provided under our current assault and battery laws are sufficient." ROAD WORKER PROTECTIONS Clowney and Ray voted in favor of HB1561, which would create penalties for drivers who commit a moving traffic violation and physically injure or kill a construction worker in a highway work zone. In cases where a person performs a dangerous job on behalf of the government, Ray said he felt enhanced penalties are justified. Clowney likewise said construction highway workers work in dangerous conditions and provide a service that the public couldn't live without or would be highly inconvenienced without. When presenting HB1561 to the House, Rep. Charlene Fite, R-Van Buren, said a constituent brought her the idea for the bill. "Her father was just doing his job, working for a construction company building one of our highways," she said Wednesday. "He was off [Interstate] 630 when he was tragically hit by a distracted driver and killed." Fite pointed to a national increase in roadway work zone accidents. Last year, state officials launched a campaign to step up enforcement of traffic violations in work zones following the death of two state Department of Transportation employees. "These men and women are just doing their job. We should help them and protect them," Fite said. Under the bill, a person who commits a moving traffic violation while driving through a highway work zone that results in a physical injury of a road worker would be guilty upon conviction of a Class A misdemeanor. If the violation results in the death of a construction worker, the driver would be guilty of a Class C felony on conviction. The bill would apply to construction personnel employed by the Arkansas Department of Transportation and local jurisdictions. It also would apply to contractors of the State Highway Commission, municipalities and counties. Fite noted that other states including Texas and Oklahoma have similar laws. While driving through work zones in these states, Fite said drivers may encounter signs warning "don't hit our workers, don't pay $10,000." "I want us to think once, twice, three times and slow down and not hit our workers," she said. The bill passed with a vote of 96-0 and was referred to the Senate Committee on Judiciary. DISARMING AN OFFICER Rep. Carlton Wing, R-North Little Rock, presented HB1521 to the House Committee on Judiciary on Thursday, saying that unlike many neighboring states, Arkansas does not have a penalty in its criminal code for people who attempt to disarm a law enforcement officer. Under current state law, a person who attempts to take an officer's firearm or other weapon may only be charged with resisting arrest, said Lt. Jim Scott of the North Little Rock Police Department, who spoke on the bill during the meeting. Brandt Carmical, chief at Camp Robinson Police Department, spoke for the bill, saying officers need a more stringent charge than resisting arrest. "Fight over a gun in the mud in a ditch, a lot of you all have probably never done that. I have," Carmical said. "After it's all said and done, the only charge you have is resisting arrest." Under the bill, a person who purposely uses physical force to take a firearm, nightstick, stun gun, "personal protection chemical dispensing device" or any "other protective gear or weapon" and intends to cause physical injury to the law enforcement officer or another person would be guilty of a Class C felony upon conviction. For the offense to apply, the officer would have to identify themselves as a law enforcement officer and would have to be wearing a distinctive uniform or badge. Clowney questioned if the charge would apply to a person who knocked an officer's weapon out of their hand while trying to resist arrest. Scott said the offense would not apply in those cases and officers would be responsible for accurately articulating what happened during an instance of resisting arrest. Rep. Andrew Collins, D-Little Rock, noted the bill could lead to a person facing a felony in addition to charges associated with resisting arrest and whatever crime they were arrested for. "Are we really gaining a lot by having a pretty significant additional felony put on there when you probably are already going to have a significant sentence that the accused would be facing?" he asked. Scott said creating the charge would make it easier for courts to track instances where offenders attempt to disarm officers. Jeff Rosenzweig, with the Arkansas Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, objected to a provision in the bill that would presume a person to "have had a conscious object to engage in conduct or cause a result with respect to a law enforcement officer." Rosenzweig said the section was unconstitutional because the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled the state has the burden of proof and cannot presume a person's intent in criminal cases. Wing told committee members the language in his bill matches that of existing laws in other states. Presuming a fix is needed, Wing agreed to pull the measure down and bring it back before the committee on March 28. On Friday, Wing said in a written statement he was working with a couple of committee members "to make sure that they are happy with any amendments while keeping intact the full effort to protect our police officers. I'm grateful for their input." Information for this article was contributed by Noel Oman and John Moritz of the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette.   Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         BERRYVILLE -- An opponent to a wind farm in eastern Carroll County will speak at Tuesday night's Quorum Court meeting even though there is little county government could do to stop the project, both opponents and a county government official said. Scout Clean Energy of Boulder, Colo., intends to erect wind turbines at various sites among 9,000 acres -- about 14 square miles -- south of Green Forest and west of Alpena, according to information posted by the company. The completed project would generate 180 megawatts at peak demand, according to announced company plans. This is enough power to supply almost 30,000 homes, according to utility industry figures. "Scout Clean Energy has been working with residents and county stakeholders on the Nimbus Wind project as far back as 2016," said Dave Iadarola, senior project manager for the company, in a statement Friday. "We have signed voluntary lease agreements with over 50 landowners. Scout estimates that the project will pay over $14 million dollars in lease payments and bring another $25 million dollars in new tax revenue for Carroll County over the life of the project," according to the statement. "Scout is excited to bring this $300 million economic investment to Carroll County, and we look forward to sharing more information at our upcoming open-house information sessions." Dates and locations of those open house sessions are being worked out, Iadarola's statement said. Discussion of the project at Tuesday's meeting will be limited to one speaker who will have 10 minutes to address the panel when it meets in Berryville, but town-hall-style meetings hosted by Scout Energy are being planned in April with dates to be announced, said Rhonda Griffin, assistant to the county judge. Griffin returned a call to County Judge David Writer. Tuesday's speaker was added to the agenda at the request of a Quorum Court member, she said. "County authority on this is limited to county road use," Griffin said. There is no county zoning or other restrictions that apply to the project, she said. "We have 50 landowners who are thrilled to death to have a lease," Griffin said, referring to property owners leasing their land for the turbines. The ones leasing the land don't live on the property they are leasing, said former County Judge Richard Williams. Williams said in a phone interview Tuesday he lives near proposed sites for windmills where property owners signed leases. He is concerned drilling to lay deep foundations for the 500-foot tall wind turbines will spoil the underground water and springs rural residents depend upon. As for the county not having much say in the project's construction, the county could have imposed restrictions at any time since talk of such projects started in earnest in 2008, kept residents better informed that this project was proceeding and at least given more opportunity for people to have their say, he said. Williams' neighbor Caroline Rogers expressed the same concerns. "I'll be surrounded by them," she said of the turbines. She doubts the broken karst topography of the area -- limestone gutted with caves and sinkholes caused by erosion -- can support the structures without foundations so deep they risk spoiling the groundwater. Wind turbine technology has advanced a great deal since 2010, when national studies showed limited wind technology feasibility in Arkansas, said Simon Mahan, executive director of the Southern Renewable Energy Association, a Little Rock-based industry group encouraging wind energy, solar energy, energy storage and transmission solutions. "There's a wind farm being build in Tunica, Miss., right now," Mahan said. If a wind farm is viable in the Mississippi River Delta region south of Memphis, then one is certainly viable in Carroll County, he said. The strength and consistency of available wind isn't the sole -- and often not even the most important -- factor in site selection, Mahan said. Access to a utility to use the power generated is vital, he said. So is avoiding historical landmarks and environmentally vulnerable areas. As for threats to birds, wind turbines rank quite low on the list of dangers, said Erin Sauer, a post-doctoral researcher for the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville in ecology and evolution. Flying into windows and feral cats are much greater risks to birds than wind turbines, Sauer said. To large birds like eagles, the remains of deer dressed in the field after being shot is a large danger because of lead left in the remains from bullets. The power lines leading from wind turbines are a greater danger to large birds than the turbines themselves, Sauer said, but those are still a minor risk.

         The Arkansas General Assembly is taking a spring break this week from its regular session, but legislative leaders are hoping to lay more groundwork during the week to help reach their goal of completing their work in the regular session by April 7. In the regular session, the Republican-dominated Legislature has enacted Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders' education overhaul legislation that raises the state's minimum teacher salary from $36,000 to $50,000 a year, creates Educational Freedom Accounts to help students attend private schools, parochial schools or to home school, and enacts many other changes in the education system. It's Act 237 of 2023. The Legislature and Sanders still have to enact a Revenue Stabilization Act that prioritizes the distribution of state general revenue in fiscal year 2024 that begins July 1, and determine what to do with $1.3 billion in unallocated general revenue surplus funds. Lawmakers also will grapple with whether to refer up to three proposed constitutional amendments to voters in the 2024 general election. Lawmakers also want to complete action on a wide variety of measures. Sanders spokeswoman Alexa Henning said Friday night that Sanders "signed the biggest, most transformational education reform in the nation into law [on March 8]. "She is pleased to have worked with her partners in the legislature to enact a bold agenda that is delivering on the promises she made," Henning said in a written statement. "She continues to work with them on passing a budget that reflects the values she has been talking about for the last two years," Henning said. "She is confident that the outcome will prioritize education investments, public safety, and reductions to the income tax." Regarding the state's Revenue Stabilization Act for fiscal 2024, a Joint Budget Committee co-chairman, Sen. Jonathan Dismang, R-Searcy, said Thursday that "I think at this point I am ready to start digging in and throwing numbers in, even if we're maybe not ready on all levels at this point. "But I think that it is time to put numbers on paper," he said. "I think we have a good idea where we are with [educational] adequacy, which is kind of the missing piece, and I'd anticipate some movement," Dismang said. "While we are out for break, I will be working on it and then when we get back ready to start having some real conversations with members." Dismang said legislative leaders have discussed budget priorities with Sanders' administration. "I think it is a legislative function to put out RSA and we take that seriously," he said. "So we absolutely will be taking into account some things they'd like to be considered." For the state's Department of Corrections, "we have got to look in the short term at what it is going to cost to staff up the beds and provide proper staffing levels at our current system," Dismang said. "The parole reform won't really start having a large impact [until] year three, four, five and on, so it is not as pertinent to what we are doing with this year's RSA," he said. In November, then-Gov. Asa Hutchinson proposed a $314 million increase in the state's general revenue budget to $6.33 billion in fiscal 2024, starting July 1, 2023, with $200 million of the increased general revenue earmarked for the public schools. At that time, the former Republican governor said his proposed budget for fiscal 2024 would represent a 5.2% increase over the current budget of $6.02 billion, leaving a projected general revenue surplus of $254.9 million at the end of fiscal year 2024. Considering inflation was more than 8% last year, limiting the growth of the state's general revenue budget to 5.2% reflects conservative budgeting, he said. The state Department of Education has projected Sanders' education overhaul law, Act 237, will cost $297.5 million, including $150 million in "new money" in fiscal 2024. Senate President Pro Tempore Bart Hester, R-Cave Springs, said a consensus hasn't been reached yet "where we are all holding hands" on how much state funding is needed to provide an adequate education to public school students. "It is so close it is almost negligible at this point," he said. Rep. Lane Jean, R-Magnolia, who is a co-chairman of the Legislative Budget Committee, said that "I am just waiting for the bottom line number for the foundation funding [per student] and I think that's what they are working on." PUBLIC SAFETY Sen. Ben Gilmore, R-Crossett, who is working with Rep. Jimmy Gazaway, R-Paragould, on the public safety legislation, reiterated Friday that he expects the legislation to be filed the week after the Legislature returns from its spring break March 27. Gazaway said Friday "the issue is not that we don't have the policy ready and that the bill is not ready. "It is. Really now the issue is how much can we devote toward [prison] capacity," he said. "Part of what I think we have understood is that this is a long-term issue. What we'll do this session will likely be the first step in what will be multiple sessions of addressing this issue. The problem with capacity wasn't created overnight and we are not going to solve it overnight." House Speaker Matthew Shepherd, R-El Dorado, said Thursday he's focused on the long-awaited public safety legislation as well as tax reduction legislation, the state's Revenue Stabilization Act, and proposed constitutional amendments. He said discussions over the cost of the public safety bill are still ongoing, and "it gets back into working through in some way looking at what else is out there from an RSA perspective." Hester said Thursday "we know that we have to pay our corrections officers more. "We know that we got to do truth-in-sentencing," he said. "The reality is on the truth-in-sentencing is how much are we going to do. The governor's office wants to see some more mental health [programs] in there, so we are really working towards that. These are issues that we all agree on." INCOME TAX CUTS Jean said Thursday there has been nothing settled yet on an income tax cut. "[But] I am smart enough to know this, the two things [Gov. Sanders] ran on was education and tax cuts," he said. "Now it may be one-tenth of 1% or two-tenths of 1%, but there will be a tax cut coming out of this session because those are the two main things she ran," Jean said. "Hey, I know enough about politics I know that those two things are going to happen. Everything else can fall through the woodwork." Shepherd said "I wouldn't say there's necessarily a number per se about what those tax cuts would entail." "I think there's ongoing discussions about the reduction, of what those reductions look like as far as off the top rate is primarily where the discussion looks like," he said. The state's top individual income tax rate is 4.9%. The state's' top corporate income tax rate is 5.3% State Department of Finance and Administration spokesman Scott Hardin said that "While we don't have a formal revenue impact for a reduction of the top rate to 4.7%, we do know the following based on previous research: Between 4.9% and 4.0%, the reduction of each tenth of a percent represents approximately $50 million in revenue." STATE EMPLOYEE PAY Sanders announced Wednesday that she will not support a broad-based pay plan increase in state government's employee classification and compensation bill. In a letter to state Transformation and Shared Services Secretary Joseph Wood, the governor wrote that Arkansas taxpayers should not be saddled with the $80 million price tag for such a proposal that doesn't consider the strategic needs in education, public safety, health care and corrections. "Today, I am directing the Department of Transformation and Shared Services to review and rework the existing classification and compensation structure of the state," Sanders wrote in her letter. "Arkansas should not have more state employees per capita than all our surrounding states. It's long past time to reduce the size and scope of government, identify efficiencies, and responsibly phase out the income tax." John Bridges, executive director of the Arkansas State Employees Association, said Thursday that " we are very discouraged to learn that Governor Sanders has declined to implement the reevaluation of the state employees' pay plan, which is estimated to cost $41 million" in general revenue. "It has been seven years since the last time the salary ranges for state employees have been adjusted and our members have been anxiously awaiting the announced revised pay plan, which was developed after a comprehensive study by the Office of Personnel Management," he said in a written statement. "We hear from agency managers that the failure to update the pay plan has made it difficult to recruit and retain talented employees, especially when the pay is already much lower than private business," Bridges said. "We look forward to working with Governor Sanders to find solutions that will fit with her strategic priorities while recognizing the hard work of 23,000 state employees all over the state." The state's unallocated general revenue allotment reserve balance is $1.34 billion, according to Hardin. The state's catastrophic reserve fund balance is $1.36 billion, he said, and the state's restricted reserve fund balance is $55.37 million. In addition, the state Department of Finance and Administration's Nov. 10 forecast projects a general revenue surplus of $598.1 million at the end of fiscal 2023. END OF SESSION Monday will be the 71st day of the 94th General Assembly's regular session. The Arkansas House and Senate have approved a resolution for the chambers to recess that started Thursday with lawmakers returning on March 27 as well as a resolution to extend the regular session beyond 60 days and to recess April 7 or at an earlier date agreed upon by the House and Senate. It would require a three-fourths vote of the 100-member House of Representatives and the 35-member Senate to extend the regular session beyond April 7. April 7 would be the 89th day of the regular session, April 14 would be the 96th day of the regular session, April 21 would be the 103rd day of the regular session, and April 28 would be the 110th day of the regular session. The regular session lasted 118 days in 2021 and was 30 days longer than the 88-day regular session in 2019. The regular session lasted 86 days in 2017 and 82 days in 2015. As April 7 approaches, Shepherd said Thursday that House members would have to be flexible and may have to meet on Fridays to consider legislation. So far, the House and Senate haven't met on a Friday throughout this year's regular session. Shepherd told reporters he believes it's still possible to wrap up the regular session in April. "But every day that goes by obviously makes it more of a challenge," Shepherd said. Hester said "the goal is April 7th. "We are going to keep our desk open through the week of spring break so members can still file bills so that when we show up Monday next week we can go to work," he said. Some lawmakers doubt it's realistic to wrap up the regular session on April 7. Sen. Linda Chesterfield, D-Little Rock, said she is not confident lawmakers can complete their business by April 7. Legislative leaders "seem to be very confident that that's going to happen," she said. "I am still waiting on a budget, and we haven't done [the Revenue Stabilization Act]. "Perhaps leadership has something going that I don't know about, but they continue to say it's going to be April 7th, so I am hopeful that they are telling us the truth," Chesterfield said.

         Curriculum moves receive approval The board of trustees of the University of Arkansas System approved curriculum changes Wednesday. The existing Master of Health Administration at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences will convert to a fully online format effective in the fall. Curriculum and credit hours will remain unchanged. The University of Arkansas at Little Rock is adding a Cybersecurity graduate certificate, a Cybersecurity technical certificate, a Game Design (Development) advanced technical certificate, and a Game Design (Development) certificate of proficiency. Phillips Community College of the University of Arkansas is axing its Computer Art and Design offering due to low productivity, as the program is very similar to its certificate in Graphic Communications, according to the UA System. No faculty or staff will be affected. Cossatot Community College of the University of Arkansas will create two new certificates of proficiency from the existing technical certificate Cosmetology Curriculum, Nail Technician and Esthetician. No new resources will be necessary. The college is also placing four programs on "inactive status": certificate of proficiency Criminal Justice, technical certificate Criminal Justice, certificate of proficiency Medical Transcription and technical certificate Medical Assisting. Changes get OK at Pulaski Tech From existing courses, the University of Arkansas Pulaski Technical College is creating a technical certificate in Electrical Lineworker Technology, which "meets industry standards and prepares students for a nationally recognized industry certification," according to the UA System. The new certificate will be taught at the college's Business and Industry Center near Bill and Hillary Clinton National Airport/Adams Field in Little Rock. The center currently serves a noncredit, workforce and community education population. UA-PTC is also reconfiguring several areas to create new credentials from existing programs, which requires no additional costs. UA-PTC will offer a technical certificate in Education, a certificate of proficiency in Education, and a certificate of proficiency in Health Information Technology. Pulaski Tech is reactivating from the inactive list a technical certificate in Applied Electronics, "which was marked for inactivation and placed on a phase-out plan for 2022-23 but will be reconfigured and aligned with the new advanced manufacturing curriculum changes," according to the UA System. UA-PTC is deleting a certificate of proficiency in Manufacturing Systems -- no students are currently declared for the program -- and a certificate of proficiency in Automated Processes, which has no students currently declared, either. Designer chosen for greenhouse The board of trustees of the University of Arkansas System approved Fort Smith's Architecture Plus firm as design professionals for the expansion of the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville's Biology Greenhouse, which was built in 2013. Architecture Plus, one of two firms to apply for the job, was recommended by the university's search committee, Chancellor Charles Robinson and UA System President Donald Bobbitt. "The need for additional space is the result of both department growth, including new and future faculty whose work requires greenhouse space, and grant obligations for existing research," according to the university. This project will add one new wing to the two original wings, and a larger greenhouse "will help support the department's mission of funded faculty research, which will, in tum, increase the university's ability to train graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and undergraduate researchers." University reserves will be used for the $1.75 million project, according to the university. The goal is to begin construction next February and complete the project in July 2025 before the 2025-26 school year begins in August. Nabholz to build Morrilton center The board of trustees for the University of Arkansas System approved Conway's Nabholz as the general contractor/construction manager for the Allied Health and Science Center project at University of Arkansas Community College at Morrilton. The college's selection committee, Chancellor Lisa Willenberg and UA System President Donald Bobbitt all concurred. The college has never had a facility specifically designed for nursing, as its nursing programs are currently in a building constructed for administration in 1963, according to Willenberg. The new facility, estimated to cost $15 million-$17 million, will also allow the college to expand offerings and programs, which could result in an enrollment increase of nearly 300 students.

         BENTONVILLE -- Sunlight filtered into the Great Hall at Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art on Saturday as students gathered in front of their murals, adding the finishing touches. Family, friends and art fans moved though the packed room, stopping to admire the projects, talk and snap photos. The event was part of the Bentonville museum's "Diego Rivera's America" exhibit. To coincide with the opening, Crystal Bridges invited Northwest Arkansas art educators and their students to participate by painting murals in Rivera's style, said Lori West, fine arts teacher at Tyson Middle School in Springdale. Rivera's paintings focused on the human experience for families and workers, good times, bad times, struggles and dreams, according to the Crystal Bridges website. Between the 1920s and '40s, he worked in Mexico and the U.S. and was inspired by the cultures of both, the website states. "We couldn't have an exhibition of Diego Rivera's work without involving the public," said Amanda Horn, senior public relations director at Crystal Bridges. "It's about access." West's seventh graders created a three-panel, 4-by-8 piece, "The Diversity of Helen Tyson Middle School." The middle section features a bookshelf with the names of countries and cities that represent the students, along with flags. There are other items important to the young artists, including a papier-mache canoe to represent Marshallese students. "I think that it's all about diversity," said student Yazmin Cassity, who named the mural. "We're all different. You want to paint something that has feeling and emotion. Incorporate something personal." There was a tight deadline to have the murals nearly complete, with the final brushstrokes to be applied in the Great Hall. West said the students' undertaking started Feb. 24. Progress was slowed by snow days, but the project was essentially wrapped up Friday, West said. "It was really hard," Yazmin said. "It was really stressful. But seeing the outcome is all worth it. It was fun because we all had to work on different parts." West broke her students into groups for various aspects of the project, including research on Rivera himself. "The research helped us understand where he's coming from," Yazmin said. "The thing I learned the most is that everybody's different. You don't know everybody's background." West said she wants the students to remember their work was on exhibit among the legends at Crystal Bridges. "I could not have chosen a crew that could handle a massive project like this any better," West said. "They exceeded my greatest expectations." Also participating were Alma Middle School, Arkansas Arts Academy, Eastside Elementary in Rogers, Springdale's Har-Ber High School, Haas Hall Academy of Fayetteville and Springdale, Huntsville High School, Lincoln Junior High of Bentonville and Ramay Junior High in Fayetteville. It was a mix of public, private and charter schools representing a variety of ages -- elementary, middle, junior and high school, Horn said. The works will be on display at Crystal Bridges through March 26. Starting in mid-April and going through July 31, Horn said, the paintings will be moved to five locations for pop-up exhibitions: The Jones Center in Springdale, Rogers City Hall, the Rogers Experimental House, the Siloam Springs Public Library and the Fayetteville Public Library. Across from the Tyson Middle School project stood a mural from Eastside Elementary with "All Belong" emblazoned in large letters across the top. Seven people -- male and female and of different races -- are depicted across the middle of the mural. The background features mountains, water and bridges. It was created by kindergarten through fifth grade students at Eastside as part of an after-school enrichment program, art teacher Steven Wise said. "It was a lot of fun," Wise said. "They learned a lot." They spent 2½ hours on Wednesdays working on it, and the mural was left in the classroom so other students could see it and share suggestions. "They did really well," Wise said of his team of 20. "I had to help with the drawing. They wanted to paint all of it."

         HIGHFILL -- Northwest Arkansas National Airport's attempt to deannex from Highfill landed at the Legislature last week with the filing of a bill Highfill officials said they intend to fight. Senate Bill 414, if passed, would allow regional airport authorities to deannex from a city, levy their own taxes on airport property and create an infrastructure and development commission to then spend those tax proceeds on operating and improving the airport. The measure would allow Northwest Arkansas National to detach from Highfill by a two-thirds vote of the airport's board. "We worked the better part of two months with outside counsel to put together what I think is a pretty strong legislative bill," Brian Burke, the airport's attorney, said Tuesday. "If passed, it will put regional airport authorities on par with cities and counties and other subordinate political subdivisions. And, it provides a detachment mechanism for the authority to implement, should it so choose." Burke urged the airport board in December to consider trying to get the law changed during this legislative session by pursuing an amendment to the state's Regional Airport Authority Act to allow regional airports to deannex. Highfill Mayor Chris Holland said he opposes the bill because it would hurt Highfill. "I don't like it. It's one-sided, the way I'm reading it," Holland said Thursday. "We've had no input in writing it." Holland said Highfill budgeted for just over $1 million in revenue this year, and it expected to get about $600,000 of that from its 2% sales tax on businesses at the airport. "That would put a big dent in our budget," Holland said. City officials intend to fight the bill, he said. "We're going to Little Rock the week after spring break to testify on it," Holland said. He said he'd like to see the airport remain in Highfill. "I think there are avenues that we can work with them to help them save some of their money. Some of the services they're offering over there, we could do to help them save money," Holland said. "Obviously, I don't think it's good for any business to leave a city. And, we'll lose a big chunk of sales tax." Holland said the bill wouldn't hurt just Highfill. "It hurts the state of Arkansas. It's basically taxation without representation," he said. "The way I read the bill, they're going to allow the board to impose a tax out there and none of them are going to be elected by the people." The bill was filed Monday by Sen. Jim Petty, R-Van Buren, and Rep. Mindy McAlindon, R-Centerton. It has 14 bipartisan co-sponsors, mostly from Northwest Arkansas. The bill was read twice this week and referred to the Senate City, County and Local Affairs Committee for consideration. BONDS AN ISSUE Airport officials began exploring how to amicably leave Highfill in September. Members of the airport's board said they never wanted the airport to be annexed into any city in the first place. "Annexation of the airport by Highfill was never in the airport's interest, but the airport had no say and no vote when that occurred," said Aaron Burkes, Northwest Arkansas National Airport CEO. "This legislation gives the airport board the ability to determine what is best for the airport and its customers." Airport officials also don't like losing a big chunk of revenue to the city when they provide most of their own services, including police and fire. "Our passengers deserve to get the best possible value from us," Burkes said Friday. "It's hard to justify taxing all of our customers exclusively for the benefit of one single community within our service area." A potential sticking point is Highfill has issued bonds based at least in part on revenue the city collects from businesses operating at the airport. The city has two water and sewer improvement bond issues of about $5.8 million that rely on sales tax revenue from the airport for payment. The Arkansas Constitution prohibits any law that impairs the obligations of contracts. The proposed change in the law would require the Northwest Arkansas National Airport Authority to pay the city for lost revenue that would have gone toward repaying those bonds as part of any deannexation. "This bill provides a very generous detachment process, should the airport board elect to pursue it, where sales tax revenues will continue to go to Highfill until all currently outstanding debts of the city are paid off," Burkes said. SEEKING MORE FROM THE CITY Highfill gets sales tax money from seven or eight food vendors at the airport, six car rental companies and other various retailers. The city also sells water to the airport. The city spends $700,000 a year in bond debt service. "While the airport's growth and use has increased dramatically over the last decade, Highfill has invested little -- if anything -- to the cost of constructing or maintaining the airport's essential infrastructure, such as roads or parking lots, and XNA has no ability whatsoever to force Highfill to contribute to those costs," Burkes said. "This bill will put XNA on more equal footing to negotiate a good faith agreement with Highfill so they can pay a fair share of infrastructure costs in relation to the sales tax revenue they receive, and we look forward to having those discussions." The bill also clarifies that regional airport authorities are entitled to statutory immunity from being sued and establishes a conflict of interest policy for regional airport authority board members that is similar to those of cities, counties and other state boards and authorities. A deannexation would also have to be approved by state and county officials. Under current law, there would be only one option: deannex from Highfill and annex into another city, according to airport officials. But that would be complicated, and it would be unlikely the airport could detach the entirety of the property it owns without creating "islands" within Highfill, which are prohibited by state law.

         If you are interested in owning a piece of property with ties to Arkansas pop culture history, you are in luck. The Jot 'Em Down Store and the Lum and Abner Museum on Arkansas 88 West in Pine Ridge are for sale. Along with the store and museum, the listing includes a former post office dating to 1886; a 1,470-square-foot, three-bedroom, two-bath home; a 1956 GMC firetruck; and a barn on more than 24 acres. The asking price is $777,000. Oh, and all the Lum and Abner memorabilia, along with other antiques and artifacts in the store and museum, convey. Lum and Abner were the characters created by Chester "Chet" Lauck and Findley Norris "Tuffy" Goff, two friends who grew up together in Mena. The immensely popular "Lum and Abner" radio show aired from 1931-1955 and was set in the fictional Arkansas town of Pine Ridge, where the pair ran the Jot 'Em Down General Store. Along with the radio show, Goff and Lauck made six Lum and Abner feature films during the 1940s. Inspired by the popularity of the program, citizens of the community of Waters in Montgomery County changed its name to Pine Ridge in 1936. The buildings that house the museum and store date to the early 1900s and were originally the A. A. McKinzie General Store and the J. R. "Dick" Huddleston General Merchandise Store, according to an entry in the online Encyclopedia of Arkansas. In 1969, Ralph and Dorothy McClure bought the Huddleston Store and its contents and in April 1972, a dedication was held for the Jot 'Em Down Store and the Lum and Abner Museum. The buildings were placed on the National Register of Historic Places on Oct. 4, 1984. Since 1979, the museum and store have been owned and operated by Dorothy McClure's son, Lon Stucker, and his wife, Kathy Stucker. Kathy is the author of the Arkansas Encyclopedia entry about Lum and Abner as well as the entry on the store and museum. She also wrote the 1992 book "Hello, This is Lum and Abner." After years of operating the store and museum, it's time to slow down, Kathy said last week. "We love it, but the trouble is we are both in our 80s and we have to take care of each other." Scott Lauck is a Hot Springs attorney and the grandson of Chester Lauck. He said he has often visited the store and museum and admires how the Stuckers have contributed to keeping the Lum and Abner legacy going. "They have really put their heart and soul into the museum and the store. I hope they find a buyer for the store and the museum that will love it and take care of it as much as they have. I know it has meant a lot to them and it has meant a lot to our family that they have helped keep the memory of Lum and Abner alive all these years." email: sclancy@adgnewsroom.com  Print Headline: Radio duo tribute site up for sale Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         100 years ago March 19, 1923 RUSSELLVILLE -- Robbers last night evidently gave up as a bad job an attempt to rob the Farmers and Merchants Bank at London, 12 miles west of Russellville, after they had blown the outer door off the vault and partially wrecked the building with two charges of nitroglycerine. Another charge placed against the door of the inner safe, containing the valuables, failed to explode. ... The explosion was heard about 1 o'clock, but no investigation was made, and the robbery was not discovered until this morning. A car was heard leaving the vicinity soon after the explosions. Bloodhounds failed to pick up any trail. 50 years ago March 19, 1973 Nine Arkansas counties, all organized between March 24 and April 21, 1873, during the Reconstruction Era in the state, will observe centennials this year. The nine are Cleveland, Clay, Faulkner, Baxter, Lonoke, Garland, Howard, Stone and Lee counties. Formed during the contested conservatorship of Elisha Baxter, the nine counties are a part of a group that is sometimes referred to as "carpetbag counties." According to Charles Nordhoff, author of "The Cotton States in the Spring and Summer of 1875," the creation of new counties was a favorite device of the "reconstructors" because new political offices were created that could be filled with appointees. 25 years ago March 19, 1998 Already considering a similar measure for dogs, Maumelle city directors Monday night discussed a ban on children ages 12 and under riding in the beds of pickups. Since revised animal-control ordinances were introduced last month, City Director Terry Miles has objected strenuously to the proposal to prohibit dogs from riding untethered in truck beds. City Directors Dean Elliott and Mark Adelstein have sided with him. Miles' objection has stemmed not from a belief in canines' welfare, but from his concern that neither Arkansas nor Maumelle regulates adults or children riding in the backs of pickups. 10 years ago March 19, 2013 PINE BLUFF -- The driver of a bus carrying the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff's vesper choir fell asleep Saturday, causing the bus to run off the road and into a median near Ratoul, Ill., according to a news release from the university. One person was treated at the scene, while four others -- including choir Director Michael Bates -- were taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital, where they were treated and later released, the news release said. There were about 60 people on the bus, according to the release. Edward Johnson, the owner of Starlight T&W Charters in Lexington, Miss., told the News-Gazette of Urbana, Ill., that the bus driver admitted he dozed off.

         Water board OKs agreement change Members of Central Arkansas Water's board of commissioners at a meeting Thursday voted to authorize the amendment of an existing engineering agreement with the firm Hazen and Sawyer for design phase services tied to the upcoming renovations of the Jack H. Wilson Water Treatment Plant in northwest Little Rock. Those services, including help with the selection and management of a "construction manager at risk" for the Wilson project, are expected to cost Central Arkansas Water a lump sum of approximately $10.2 million. Hazen and Sawyer was originally hired in August 2020 to perform an engineering study and report on possible rehabilitation of the plant that was completed in mid-2022, according to board documents. The firm is expected to continue collaborating with a local engineering firm, Hawkins-Weir Engineers, on the project. The need to upgrade the Wilson plant, which was constructed in the 1960s, contributed to Central Arkansas Water's recent decision to pursue a 10-year schedule of rate increases. The utility's board of commissioners approved the rate schedule in January and the first set of higher rates is expected to take effect on July 1. 'Turn Every Page' film screening set The Central Arkansas Library System will host a screening of the film "Turn Every Page" followed by a discussion with its director, Lizzie Gottlieb, on April 20 at the Ron Robinson Theater. The documentary, which premiered at the 2022 Tribeca Film Festival, "explores the remarkable fifty-year relationship between two literary legends, writer Robert Caro and his longtime editor Robert Gottlieb," a recent library system news release said. Robert Gottlieb is the director's father. The screening is scheduled for 6 p.m. and the discussion with Gottlieb will begin at 8 p.m. Central Arkansas Library System Executive Director Nate Coulter will serve as moderator. More meetings on projects set Four more public meetings on how the city of Little Rock plans to deploy an initial set of bond proceeds on street and drainage projects will take place later this month and early next month. Meetings are scheduled for March 27 (1818 Reservoir Road), March 29 (4501 Rahling Road), March 30 (5300 Stagecoach Road) and April 5 (6401 Baseline Road). All will take place at 6 p.m. In an August 2022 referendum, Little Rock voters authorized a $161.8 million bond issue and an extension on 3 mills tied to capital improvements to bankroll six project categories. Streets and drainage represent the largest of the six.  Print Headline: little rock notebook Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         District, energy firm agree to deal The Little Rock School Board agreed last week to a no-cost contract with Entegrity Energy Partners of Little Rock for an energy audit and project proposal with an eye toward a possible second contract to have Entegrity design and implement energy- and water-conservation measures. The audit will in part evaluate solar options to maximize the Little Rock School District's energy and cost sayings, including the use of off- and on-site solar arrays. The School Board for the 21,000-student school system in September directed Superintendent Jermall Wright and his staff to solicit proposals from energy service companies to evaluate the district's energy consumption and propose how to meet at least some of those energy demands with solar power. The district received five responses to the request for proposals. A district committee interviewed three of the responders, according to documents presented to the School Board in support of the Entegrity recommendation. The School Board authorized the request for proposals last year at the urging of Central High School's Young Leftist Club and others who had appealed to the board to consider alternative, sustainable energy sources. 2 state schools awarded grants An Arkansas school district and a school are among 20 schools and districts in the nation selected to receive grants to create in-school spaces for students to reset at times of anxiety, frustration and anger. Woods Elementary School in Fort Smith and the Cutter Morning Star School District are in line for "Calm Room" matching grants of up to $5,000. The grants are to help schools establish therapeutic spaces for students who need to regain composure for classroom instruction. The Cook Center for Human Connection, a Utah-based nonprofit organization focused on mental health and suicide prevention, is the grant provider. More than 200 schools applied, and those that demonstrated the greatest need and ability to make an immediate impact were selected as grant winners, according to the Cook Center. Texarkana school names principal Brad Bailey has been selected to be the new principal of Arkansas High School in Texarkana, Superintendent Becky Kesler said last week. Robin Hickerson, who has served in the role as high school principal and assistant superintendent, has announced plans to retire from the district, effective June 30. Bailey has worked since 2021 as assistant superintendent of operations/Title IX coordinator in the Lake Travis Independent School District in Texas. From 2007 to 2021, Bailey held the positions of assistant principal and then principal at Texas High School in the Texarkana Independent School District. He began his career as a teacher/coach at Gillett Junior High and Gillett High School in Arkansas.

         Curriculum moves receive approval The board of trustees of the University of Arkansas System approved curriculum changes Wednesday. The existing Master of Health Administration at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences will convert to a fully online format effective in the fall. Curriculum and credit hours will remain unchanged. The University of Arkansas at Little Rock is adding a Cybersecurity graduate certificate, a Cybersecurity technical certificate, a Game Design (Development) advanced technical certificate, and a Game Design (Development) certificate of proficiency. Phillips Community College of the University of Arkansas is axing its Computer Art and Design offering due to low productivity, as the program is very similar to its certificate in Graphic Communications, according to the UA System. No faculty or staff will be affected. Cossatot Community College of the University of Arkansas will create two new certificates of proficiency from the existing technical certificate Cosmetology Curriculum, Nail Technician and Esthetician. No new resources will be necessary. The college is also placing four programs on "inactive status": certificate of proficiency Criminal Justice, technical certificate Criminal Justice, certificate of proficiency Medical Transcription and technical certificate Medical Assisting. Changes get OK at Pulaski Tech From existing courses, the University of Arkansas Pulaski Technical College is creating a technical certificate in Electrical Lineworker Technology, which "meets industry standards and prepares students for a nationally recognized industry certification," according to the UA System. The new certificate will be taught at the college's Business and Industry Center near Bill and Hillary Clinton National Airport/Adams Field in Little Rock. The center currently serves a noncredit, workforce and community education population. UA-PTC is also reconfiguring several areas to create new credentials from existing programs, which requires no additional costs. UA-PTC will offer a technical certificate in Education, a certificate of proficiency in Education, and a certificate of proficiency in Health Information Technology. Pulaski Tech is reactivating from the inactive list a technical certificate in Applied Electronics, "which was marked for inactivation and placed on a phase-out plan for 2022-23 but will be reconfigured and aligned with the new advanced manufacturing curriculum changes," according to the UA System. UA-PTC is deleting a certificate of proficiency in Manufacturing Systems -- no students are currently declared for the program -- and a certificate of proficiency in Automated Processes, which has no students currently declared, either. Designer chosen for greenhouse The board of trustees of the University of Arkansas System approved Fort Smith's Architecture Plus firm as design professionals for the expansion of the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville's Biology Greenhouse, which was built in 2013. Architecture Plus, one of two firms to apply for the job, was recommended by the university's search committee, Chancellor Charles Robinson and UA System President Donald Bobbitt. "The need for additional space is the result of both department growth, including new and future faculty whose work requires greenhouse space, and grant obligations for existing research," according to the university. This project will add one new wing to the two original wings, and a larger greenhouse "will help support the department's mission of funded faculty research, which will, in tum, increase the university's ability to train graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and undergraduate researchers." University reserves will be used for the $1.75 million project, according to the university. The goal is to begin construction next February and complete the project in July 2025 before the 2025-26 school year begins in August. Nabholz to build Morrilton center The board of trustees for the University of Arkansas System approved Conway's Nabholz as the general contractor/construction manager for the Allied Health and Science Center project at University of Arkansas Community College at Morrilton. The college's selection committee, Chancellor Lisa Willenberg and UA System President Donald Bobbitt all concurred. The college has never had a facility specifically designed for nursing, as its nursing programs are currently in a building constructed for administration in 1963, according to Willenberg. The new facility, estimated to cost $15 million-$17 million, will also allow the college to expand offerings and programs, which could result in an enrollment increase of nearly 300 students.

         FORT SMITH -- The city of Fort Smith can keep the almost $750,000 it collected in recycling fees while recyclables were being dumped in the landfill, the Arkansas Supreme Court ruled Thursday. The decision overturned a Sebastian County Circuit Court ruling that ordered the city pay $745,057 in restitution for the fees. The Supreme Court said Fort Smith used the fee for its intended purpose, and no evidence showed the fee didn't bear a reasonable relationship to the benefits conferred. "The Fort Smith ordinance set a single fee for the cost of residential collection and disposal of solid waste, recycling, and yard waste. And Fort Smith spent the funds on the collection and disposal of solid waste, recycling, and yard waste," the ruling states. Sebastian County Circuit Judge Stephen Tabor ruled in August the city misused customer money from the Sanitation Department from July 2015 until May 2017, noting the city purposefully deceived the public about its recycling program. The city even sent recycling trucks around on trash day to collect the items but took them to the landfill, he said. Resident Jennifer Merriott filed the lawsuit against the city, seeking to recover money from its recycling program. She contended the city was guilty of illegal exaction and unjust enrichment because the city charged a roughly $13-a-month fee for recycling. In a court filing June 24, the plaintiffs argued by the city's own estimates over 95% of residential recyclables went to a landfill while the city encouraged residential customers to continue their recycling efforts. The filing said the city didn't inform customers recyclables were being taken to a landfill.  Print Headline: Ruling: City can keep fees Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         A man has been arrested in the killing of a man found dead, apparently of an injury from a crossbow bolt, at a southwest Little Rock apartment complex last week, police said Saturday. According to an arrest report, the bolt fired by Jerry Crutcher, 56, also struck and injured a second person, who wasn't named in the report. Crutcher was arrested at 3 p.m. Friday on a first-degree murder charge in the death of Charlie Williams, 66, as well as on a charge of second-degree battery, the report says. "Mr. Crutcher fired crossbow and struck the victim killing him," an officer wrote in the report. "During the incident a second victim was struck by the arrow." Williams was found dead about 4:40 a.m. March 12 at 7515 Geyer Springs Road, about two blocks north of Interstate 30. Police said Williams lived at that address, where the Spanish Willows Apartments are located. Crutcher was being held in the Pulaski County jail Saturday in lieu of a $500,000 cash-only bond, according to the jail's online inmate roster.

         An unidentified minor was killed and one person was injured in a one-car crash late Friday in Hot Springs, according to an Hot Springs Police Department crash report. The minor was a passenger in a car being driven by Elizabeth Tabora Hill, 21, of Hot Springs, according to the report. About 11:59 p.m. Friday, Hill was driving a 2010 Buick Lacrosse west on Airport Road (U.S. 70 B), when the accident occurred. The scene of the accident was close to 400 Airport Road, near the railroad tracks that run just north of Hot Springs Memorial Field. According to the police report, Hill was attempting to pass another vehicle that was in the center turn lane when she lost control of the car. The Buick then struck a curb, went airborne, struck the railroad overhead signal and then overturned. Both Hill and the minor passenger were taken to CHI St. Vincent Hot Springs, where the minor was pronounced dead. The investigating officer noted that weather conditions were clear and the road was dry. According to the Arkansas Department of Public Safety, the minor's death is the state's 108th fatality as a result of a car crash this year.

         FORT SMITH -- One of Nancy Martinez Tejada's goals as board president of the Literacy Council of Western Arkansas is to inspire others in the community. Originally from El Salvador, Tejada, 35, was a student at the Literacy Council and served on its board before being elected board president in August. She lives in Fort Smith with her husband and two boys and runs her own business. Tejada said people can do "amazing things" when they learn another language, as she did with English through classes the Literacy Council provided. "I think what she wants is to make sure other people know that, even though it's hard to start, you can accomplish anything you want to if you just put the work into it and get the help you need," Bente Eriksen, executive director of the Literacy Council, said. Eriksen said the council, a nonprofit organization, provides tutoring services concerning a variety of subjects. This includes adult basic education, general educational development exam preparation, English as a second language, Spanish, citizenship and drivers education, as well as health, financial and digital literacy. The council offers the services free of charge to anyone 16 and older, according to the organization's website. New students can enroll at any time, after which they are matched with a volunteer tutor and tutoring sessions -- which are provided either one-on-one or in small groups -- are scheduled based on student needs and availability. The organization started two additional programs last year -- a clothes closet in August and a food pantry in October.  Eriksen said the council not only helps its students through its educational services, but their families and friends by extension. Through its other services, such as the clothes closet and food pantry, Eriksen wants the organization to be known as a community space that will offer any kind of help to anybody who comes in. "We do not look at if they have a birth certificate, or if they have their status because they are people -- all of them -- and all of them need help," Eriksen said. "Many of the places people turn to say, 'Yeah, yeah, we will help you,' but it stops there. We want to be the place that actually can help." Tejada said she started taking one-hour classes twice a week on reading, writing and speaking English with a personal tutor at the Literacy Council in 2013. Prior to this, she received a general educational development certification through the Crawford County Adult Education Center in Van Buren in 2009 and a high school diploma in El Salvador. Tejada was motivated to take the classes by her desire to get a better job and have full conversations with different types of people. She said although she knew a little English at the time, she was afraid to a certain extent due to her accent. "That's one of the biggest fears that many people like us have," Tejada said. Tejada continued her education through the organization for almost a year. She said the classes she took allowed her to learn a language and lose her fears to the point she was able to start her business in January 2018 -- Avanty Multiservice at 2231 Midland Blvd. She offers services as a notary public, insurance agent and tax preparer, working mostly with the Hispanic community in the River Valley. Eriksen said Tejada began serving on the Literacy Council's board about three years ago. "I wanted to return something of what I was given," Tejada said. Eriksen said Tejada is doing very well as president of the board after her fellow board members voted her into this position. As a former student of the Literacy Council, Tejada knows what the organization is doing and can do to help people. She also has a remarkable outreach to the Hispanic community. "Having a former student sitting on the board is wonderful," Eriksen said. "I have former volunteers, I have former tutors sitting on the board, but having a student on the board, she is why we're here, and she can tell everybody why we're here and that's priceless." Eriksen said Tejada leads by example, working to personally address needs of the Literacy Council as they come up. She credits Tejada as one of the primary instigators for the creation of the organization's food pantry late last year. 100 people were enrolled in the Literacy Council's classes in total as of Thursday, according to Eriksen.

         FORT SMITH -- The U.S. Marshals Museum is still on track to open this summer as its exhibits are being installed, according to its president and chief executive officer. Ben Johnson said the museum's exhibit design team arrived with the first two truckloads of "scenic materials" for its permanent exhibit gallery March 6. The team has been installing the material rapidly since then. Johnson estimated their work will be finished in another couple of months. The museum's exhibit experience will include five dedicated galleries concerning the U.S. Marshals Service and its history, according to the museum website. The galleries will consist of: To Be a Marshal, Frontier Marshals, the Campfire, a Changing Nation and Modern Marshals. Johnson said the museum's gallery space will be more than a large room with "words on the wall and old stuff in cases." It will be an immersive experience in which visitors can take part. "When I say 'scenic stuff,' you're going to have the facade of a courthouse within which the Constitution comes to life in an animated interactive experience," Johnson said. "You're going to have a campfire beneath the stars in a rocky outcropping where four deputy marshals from different historical eras are sitting there speaking to each other. You're going to have a saloon scene where you walk through the swinging doors and a bartender speaks to you and tells you stories." Doug Babb, chairman of the museum's board, said in January that Thinkwell Group, a Los Angeles company, has been coordinating with about 60 or 70 vendors across the United States and Canada to design and build the museum's exhibits. The museum signed a $7.8 million contract with Thinkwell in November 2021.  Thinkwell and others are working to install the exhibits, according to Johnson. He anticipates being able to announce an opening date for the museum within the next two months as the component shipping and installation process continues. Johnson said Little Rock-based CDI Contractors has also nearly finished construction in the museum to accommodate the exhibits, a process that started in early October. There is slightly more than 18,000 square feet of exhibit space. "We're finishing up some of the electrical work and cabling right now, but it's basically ready for the exhibit folks to do their magic," Johnson said. Johnson said the museum also has been hiring additional people ahead of its planned opening. The museum had five or six full-time staff members when Johnson started in his position in August, a number that has since grown to 12. It will likely add about 15 more employees. "The last folks that we'll end up bringing in will be the front line, guest-facing staff, whether they're full- or part-time or temporary seasonal," Johnson said. "Those'll be here in the coming months." The Marshals Museum Foundation has to raise about $3.5 million to complete its approximately $50 million capital campaign, according to Johnson. This will go toward finishing the museum's exhibits, filling out its staff and buying any remaining furniture, fixtures and equipment it needs to operate. It will also help cover operating expenses as the museum opens. Babb has said the price of the exhibits went up as a result of inflation and supply chain issues, among other factors, that came after the museum signed the Thinkwell contract. Susan Neyman, the museum's chief development officer and foundation president, said the foundation has raised about $46.5 million since Fort Smith was announced as the museum site in January 2007. Neyman said the foundation's board is working hard to forge connections with individuals, companies and other foundations to close the $3.5 million gap in the capital campaign. It anticipates hearing more on a number of proposals for money from others. The foundation is also re-engaging donors who invested in the museum project early in its lifespan and have been waiting to do anything else until the museum was closer to opening, according to Neyman. It has been inviting people to the museum to see what their initial investment has been able to accomplish and how they can help finish the project. "We have people in regularly, almost daily now," Neyman said. "We're giving tours, taking them through the building -- some of whom have never been in the building at all and some it's been a number of years, so they've not seen any of the exhibit progress or the things that you can't see when you just drive by the building." The Division of Arkansas Heritage announced Feb. 22 the Marshals Museum as one of five nonprofit recipients of its Arkansas Cultural Institutions Trust Fund award. The museum received $800,000 for the creation and installation of its exhibit space, according to a state news release. Fort Smith voters rejected a proposal in March 2019 to levy a nine-month, 1% sales tax to pay for the museum's completion. Construction of the main museum building, which consists of about 53,000 square feet at 789 Riverfront Drive along the Arkansas River, was completed in January 2020.

         VAN BUREN -- The Crawford County Quorum Court will have a new member joining its ranks later this year. The Quorum Court voted 8-0 to declare a vacancy in the District 4 justice of the peace position at its meeting Monday. County Judge Chris Keith said the county will recommend someone to be appointed to serve out the remainder of Michael Morrison's two-year term. The recommendation will be sent to Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who will make the decision. Morrison occupied the District 4 justice of the peace seat since January 2021, according to the county clerk's office. In January, he was sworn in for another term, which is set to expire in December 2024. However, Morrison announced his resignation during the Quorum Court's Jan. 17 meeting, effective that night, to accept a job in Little Rock, according to the meeting minutes. The Quorum Court also voted 8-0 to to submit an application to the state for grant money through the Arkansas Community and Economic Development Program. This money would go to a project designed to provide drinking water to about 625 households in north-central Crawford County. Keith said Monday he believed the application, which involves Mountainburg and the Fort Smith-based Western Arkansas Planning and Development District, will be for $1 million. Mountainburg Mayor Susan Wilson has said households between Mountainburg and Cedarville from the Washington County line south to Rudy aren't served by any water system. Residents get water from wells or an outside source, such as the Lake Fort Smith Water Treatment Plant in Mountainburg. Mountainburg buys water from Fort Smith. Wes LeMonier of the Van Buren-based firm Hawkins-Weir Engineers has said the project proposed to provide these people water will add 68 miles of pipe from Mountainburg's water distribution system to households in the affected area, as well as build infrastructure such as three water storage tanks, pressure-reducing valves and a new pump station. The project will improve three pump stations as well. LeMonier estimated construction will take two years. The project covers about 54 square miles and is estimated to cost more than $13.4 million. Hawkins-Weir developed the project in collaboration with a committee of people who own property in the affected area. The Quorum Court and the Arkansas Natural Resources Commission each awarded Mountainburg $2.5 million in American Rescue Plan money for the water project in 2022. Wilson announced Feb. 1 the U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development awarded the town $7.4 million, including $5.7 million in grant money and $1.7 million in loans. LeMonier said $1 million would cover connecting low-to-moderate-income residents to the planned water system and bringing their plumbing up to state standards. Any leftover money would go to project costs. Aside from Morrison, justices of the peace Robert Arnold, Lonnie Myers, Morgan Morgan and Jayson Peppas were also absent from Monday's meeting. These absences didn't leave enough of a quorum to allow the Quorum Court to vote on any of the ordinances on its meeting agenda, according to Keith. The ordinances will be discussed at the Quorum Court's meeting April 17. []  Print Headline: Crawford County Quorum Court declares vacancy Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         LITTLE ROCK -- Sparks flew at the federal courthouse in Little Rock on Friday as two defense attorneys found themselves in hot water with a federal judge for showing up late for back-to-back pretrial conferences and failing to adequately communicate with the court. U.S. District Judge James M. Moody Jr. grew even angrier when he learned that both attorneys -- Willard Proctor and Adam Childers -- intended to negotiate plea deals for their clients but had not informed him, although both were scheduled for trial within days. A hearing for Proctor's client was delayed nearly an hour, and although Childers said he had sent a message that morning that he would be absent, no one received it. Part of Moody's consternation stemmed from having received no information as to the status of the two cases while the two criminal trials were scheduled just days away. Also, with both defendants in federal custody, arrangements would have to be made with an already overloaded U.S. Marshals Service to arrange additional transport in an already bulging court calendar. The trouble began just after 10 a.m. as Moody prepared to get underway with a status conference for a scheduled trial involving Herbert Wilson, 62, of Tuckerman, who was federally indicted on two counts of possession of child pornography with intent to view, but his attorney, Proctor, was not in the courtroom. After several phone calls Moody reached Proctor, who had been held up at another hearing that morning, and ordered him to get to court. At 10:50, Proctor, a former Pulaski County Circuit Court judge, arrived and the hearing got underway as Moody, clearly irritated, lit into him. "This case is set for trial roughly two weeks from today and I haven't heard anything from defense counsel on whether his client plans to change his plea or we're going to go to trial," Moody said. Assistant U.S. Attorney Kristin Bryant told Moody that, at that point, there was no plea offer on the table for Wilson. "I asked if the defendant wanted a plea offer and I haven't heard anything back," Bryant said. "I don't typically make plea offers unless I know the defendant wants one." Bryant said she emailed Proctor on March 6 to inquire in order to meet a joint reporting deadline to the court. Wilson's trial was scheduled to get underway April 3 in Jonesboro. At that point, Moody, who had spent several minutes that morning on the phone with Proctor, began to lose patience. "We had a lengthy conversation on the phone where you said you intended to plead this case all along, at least before trial," Moody said. "That's in two weeks. ... When did you discuss this with your client because he said he hasn't spoken to you since his bond hearing in early December." Proctor said he had been working to postpone some state court hearings for Wilson to get his federal prosecution resolved first. "What do you plan to do with the case, Mr. Proctor?" Moody asked, angrily. "You've left me hanging until two weeks before the trial and we emailed you yesterday to see if you were going to be here and we got ghosted. Radio silence. No response to our email at all." Proctor explained that he had not responded to the email the night before because he had been in court all that day. "I generally try to do it in the evening but I wasn't able to," he said. "I had every intent to be here at 10. I was set for 9 [in another court] but there was another case called before me." Apologetically, Proctor tried to explain that he had been sick for two weeks and after court Thursday was "physically drained and tired," and had not gotten to all of his emails that day. Still angry, Moody explained that he had set the status hearing because of a lack of communication. "The notion that I have to hold this hearing in the first place to find out what you plan on doing on a case that's set for trial two weeks from now in the first instance is unnecessary and a waste of time," Moody said. "And it's all on you because you haven't communicated with us and potentially not with your client in quite some time." Proctor asked Moody if a hearing could be scheduled for early afternoon to enter a plea. "I'll take whatever offer they're going to make to my client and see if we can get this resolved." "You've probably got about 30 minutes to get that done," Moody said, relenting slightly. "I've got a 10:30, which it's 10:50 now and I've got an 11 o'clock and I didn't plan on being here waiting on you to get your plea this afternoon." Moody then turned his attention to Childers, whose client, Michael Lynn Tappin, 28, of Little Rock, is scheduled to go to trial April 10 on drug distribution and firearm charges. Tappin was arrested by Little Rock police Aug. 20, 2021, after drugs and a pistol were reportedly found in his car following a traffic stop in southwest Little Rock. Childers arrived in court within a few minutes of receiving a call from Assistant U.S. Attorney Benecia Moore, the prosecutor in the case. "There's been no motion for a continuance, no request to set a plea hearing and I don't have any information from Mr. Childers as to what he plans to do," Moody said. "That's why this hearing was called, to find out why I've been left in the dark three weeks before the trial. "The notion of whether you want to get this pled or not, you already know that," Moody continued. "That's why we set this hearing, because we haven't heard from you. ... Here you are again, telling me you're going to get around to letting me know when you'll plea this case and we're three weeks out." Childers, apologetically, told Moody he had not intended to leave him in the dark about his intentions. "Well, we are in the dark," Moody shot back. "That's why we set this hearing. And I don't know how you told us you weren't going to be on time today. Did you talk to a live human being?" "I emailed," Childers answered. "No," Moody replied. "If you're supposed to be here within an hour of the court you don't assume we're going to be able to leave court to read your emails. ... And obviously, you were able to make it on 20 minutes notice." At Childers request, Moody set a plea hearing for Wednesday at 10:30 a.m. At 1 p.m., Proctor and Wilson returned to the courtroom with Assistant U.S. Attorney Amanda Fields stepping in for Bryant to handle the plea. Wilson was accused of sending sexually explicit photos of himself to a 16-year-old family member, who, according to court records, told police that he had been sexually abusing her since she was 5 years old. She admitted to having sent Wilson two nude photos of herself, which Wilson later sent to the Tuckerman chief of police in an attempt to cooperate with the investigation, court records said, but he denied any wrongdoing, saying that he kept the images as evidence and as leverage against the girl's mother. Wilson pleaded guilty to one count of possession of child pornography and the other was dismissed. When he comes up for sentencing later this year, he faces a possible 10-year maximum prison sentence.

         LITTLE ROCK -- A Little Rock man is facing as much as 20 years in prison after pleading guilty in federal court Wednesday to distribution of fentanyl in connection with the drug overdose death of his girlfriend in a Little Rock motel room in 2019. According to a plea agreement, Jeffrey Johnson, 39, was at the Best Value Inn in Little Rock on Jan. 7, 2021, with his girlfriend and he gave her a mixture of heroin and fentanyl. After she took the drugs, the plea agreement said, she fell to the floor, unconscious and not breathing. According to the plea agreement, Johnson gave her CPR until she began breathing again, at which time he placed her in the bed, then fell asleep himself. The next morning, the plea agreement said, Johnson discovered she was not breathing and had no heartbeat. She was pronounced dead later that day at a Little Rock hospital. According to Assistant U.S. Attorney Stacy Williams, Johnson faces a maximum prison term of 20 years, a $1 million fine and three years to life on supervised release. U.S. District Judge James M. Moody Jr. explained to Johnson that if he meets the requirements as a career criminal, he could face a much higher sentence. Johnson was indicted Feb. 3, 2021, by a federal grand jury in Little Rock on charges of distribution of fentanyl and distribution of heroin. In exchange for his guilty plea on the fentanyl distribution count, Moody dismissed the heroin distribution count. Moody explained Johnson's rights and the rights he would surrender by pleading guilty and said that although a sentencing range would be calculated using U.S. sentencing guidelines, Moody would not be bound by the agreement and could sentence him to any prison term up to the maximum statutory sentence. "If you plead guilty and I accept it, you're going to be found guilty on your guilty plea. There won't be any trial and you will have waived all of these rights," Moody said. "The United States Sentencing Commission has issued guidelines and I want to make crystal clear that the guidelines are not mandatory. Based on your circumstances and my discretion, I can sentence you any terms of years that's within your statutory penalty if I think that's justified." Moody warned Johnson that, should that occur, he would not be allowed to withdraw his plea. Moody said if the guideline range that will be calculated at his sentencing hearing using a pre-sentence report compiled by the U.S. Probation Office were to be higher than expected, he would not be allowed to withdraw his plea. "Parole has been abolished and if you're sentenced to prison you will not be released early on parole," he explained, adding that if he were to violate the terms of his supervised release after leaving prison, he could wind up going back to prison and the combined sentence could exceed the statutory maximum. He also asked if anyone had promised him anything not in the plea agreement in exchange for his guilty plea. "I'm basically saying no side deals that aren't contained in the paperwork," Moody said. Moody also warned Johnson that he has no involvement in the plea agreement process and is not bound by its terms. "All of those terms may be binding on the government and binding on you but they're not binding on me," he said. "Your sentence is going to be completely up to me." After Williams read the terms of the plea agreement, the elements of the crime, and the rights Johnson would be surrendering, Moody referenced the plea facts contained in the agreement, which Johnson declined to have read in open court. "If this case were to go to trial do you believe the government could prove each and every fact laid out in [the plea agreement]?" Moody asked. "Yes," Johnson answered. "Is that because those facts are true?" Moody asked. "Yes sir," he repeated. "Do you admit that you knowingly distributed a controlled substance to someone else?" Moody asked. "And at the time you knew it was a controlled substance?" In a low voice, Johnson said both were true. "Do you believe it's in your best interests to plead guilty?" Moody continued, to which Johnson answered affirmatively. "How do you plead?" Moody asked. "Guilty," Johnson replied.

        FORT SMITH — Residents would be required to get their dogs and cats spayed or neutered as one part of a proposed revision of the citys animal ordinance that city directors will consider at their meeting Tuesday. Directors heard the proposed amendments and gave feedback during a study session last week. A memo to City Administrator Carl Geffken from Deputy City Administrator Jeff Dingman summarized the revisions, which includes removing references to the Animal Services Advisory Board because the board has opted to review animal-related items on its own. It also removes references to annual pet licensing. Dingman explained at a directors meeting in November the pet license was adopted a few years ago but not implemented or enforced, which is why its removed in the proposal. The proposal states a stray animal given to a shelter will not be released from the shelter or impoundment facility until it is microchipped and spayed or neutered. It also specifies animals must be vaccinated before they will be released, and the owner must show proof of vaccination in order to claim the animal. If the owner cannot provide proof, the facility will vaccinate the animal before release, and the owner will pay for it and the spay or neuter. The city is working on a voucher system to help pay for animals to be spayed and neutered on a first-come, first-served basis. How many vouchers will be available is uncertain at this time. At-large Director Christina Catsavis said she thinks microchipping might be a financial burden to some people, and a collar with an identifying tag should be sufficient. The proposal also removes the prohibition of “vicious” behaving animals within the city and instead sets certain parameters for these animals, such as requiring those wishing to maintain an aggressive animal in the city to pay an annual special license fee of $500 per year, plus requiring the animal to be spayed or neutered. The proposal also increases the breeders license fee for dogs and cats from $500 to $1,000 per year per animal in addition to a business license. Thats because bred puppies can often sell for $2,500 or more, meaning a breeder can make over $10,000 for a litter, Geffken said. The proposal prohibits feeding or harboring wildlife and stray animals, or leaving pet food out unattended. Catsavis said Fort Smith is full of kind people with good hearts wanting to feed stray animals, and she doesnt feel good about banning that. Geffken said leaving food out can attract other animals carrying diseases harmful to pets and children. “I like the fact that there are places that raccoons and foxes and deer can live and not be affected by human activity, but the feeding thing, leaving food unattended, is kind of a dangerous thing,” Ward 3 Director Lavon Morton said. “And I think this is kind of a compromise with what [Ding-mans] done here. But I share your concern. I want people to be able to feed stray dogs and stray cats and domestic type animals without being concerned of getting fined.” The proposal reduces the number of adult dogs a person can maintain in a home without being considered a kennel from seven to four, as recommended by the Police Department. Kennels may be operated where properly zoned with a license of $150 per year in addition to a business license. There is an exception for the temporary housing of foster animals on behalf of a shelter or for purposes of re-homing them. Morton asked how the city will enforce that if a residence already has seven dogs. Ding-man said he doesnt know, but the city needed to draw a limit somewhere. “And I agree,” Morton said. “Its just I dont want to tell people ‘pick three dogs you have to get rid of, so I think we need to think about that. Seven is too many.” Geffken said there is a potential to grandfather those owners in. At-large Director Neal Martin questioned how most of the proposal will be enforced. “Enforceability is going to be an issue, and our capacity to do enforcement is still going to be an issue for a time, but it will not be better if we do not do something like this,” Dingman said. Martin said he doesnt want to fine people until theyre facing jail time or do irreparable harm to people who cant afford several fines. The community definitely needs an animal ordinance, he said. Geffken said the city is aware of that, and the ordinance can be amended if needed. At-large Director Kevin Settle asked the ordinance include a yearly review by directors. Ward 2 Director Andre Good said hes been on the board since 2008, and the directors have been talking about pets since that time. He said the city has been lenient by not having the proper ordinances in place, and while the directors wont like everything being proposed, theyre good policies to make a change. The city is full of people who care about animals, but theres also a “large segment” of the community that are irresponsible pet owners, Good said.
