         Traffic at the Immanuel Baptist Church City Center, located at 315 N. Shackleford, was brisk Monday as residents affected by Friday's tornado mingled with volunteers working to assist families. This scene unfolded just a few hundred yards from the epicenter of where Friday's EF3 tornado touched down and where some of the heaviest damage in Central Arkansas is located. "I've been here since 9:30 and it's been pretty steady," said Jerry Halpaincq of North Little Rock, who was separating sacks of food items into lines of perishable and non-perishable items. "People who don't have any power can pick up non-perishable food items while we're adding a few perishable items to give out to those who have power and are able to keep food refrigerated," Halpain said. Halpain said he and his family lived in the Sturbridge neighborhood until 2017, and when he saw the damage to his old neighborhood, he decided to act. "We live about a half-mile from where the tornado set down in North Little Rock so, while we weren't directly affected, we were affected," Halpain said as he placed loaves of bread into sacks he was readying for distribution in a drive-through line set up in the parking lot. "So we wanted to come and help out."  Matt Hubbard, Immanuel Baptist Church's missions pastor and overseer of the City Center, said the center has received an outpouring of support from people bringing donations or volunteering to help feed people, sort and prep donations for distribution, as well as from government officials and disaster relief organizations providing assistance and information to those affected by the disaster.  Behind Hubbard, in the center's main staging area, pallets of bottled water, paper goods, cardboard boxes and other items were placed in preparation to send out while volunteers and residents mingled in sitting areas and volunteers with pallet jacks moved items about.  Outside the front of the center, Goodwill Industries volunteers handed out hot meals prepared by Southern Baptist Disaster Relief and Salvation Army volunteers while others manned a drive-through area loading sacks of groceries into cars as people pulled through the parking lot.  "Because of the tornado, we're responding to the needs of our city," he said. "So families can come get a hot meal ... and they can also go through the line and get some supplies like non-perishable items, paper goods, diapers, bottled water, we've even got cardboard boxes for those going through their belongings, we've tarps and all of that resourcing here." Hubbard said, in addition to volunteers willing to sign up to work in five-hour shifts, one of the most critical needs right now is portable power banks so that people without power can keep their cell phones charged. He said the center also needs non-perishable food items and clothing of all sizes for all genders. "We would prefer new clothing but we'll take gently used," he said, "just remember it's clothing you would want to wear."  The City Center is open daily from 10 a.m. until 7 p.m., Hubbard said, "until they tell us otherwise."  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        Firefighters whose west Little Rock station was damaged following Fridays devastating tornado are operating out of a different location as cleanup efforts continue Monday.  Little Rock Fire Department Operating Chief Michael Doan said the move was temporary, but that it was too soon to tell when the firefighters would be able to return to work at their station.  Fire Station No. 9, 1324 N. Shackleford Road, was heavily damaged when the tornado swept through Central Arkansas, cutting a six-and-a-half mile trail of destruction in the city before continuing north through North Little Rock, Sherwood and Jacksonville.  Capt. Shawn Fisher, who was acting battalion chief at the station on Friday, said the firefighters had been preparing their apparatus and tools when the tornado struck.  “I heard one of them say ‘debris, and I looked up and there was, probably five or six hundred feet in the air, what looked to be flies,” he said. They ran to Fishers office, the last one in shutting the door, and took cover.  “The freight train came through,” he said. After the tornado passed, they checked on one another, examined the station for damage and shut off the water and gas. A 40-foot beam had traveled roughly 60 yards from a neighboring church and struck “halfway through the station.”  One of the facilitys engine bay doors flew about 80 yards to the west, damaging another building. Fisher said he has no idea how much repairs to the station will cost. Despite the damage to the facility, its vehicles — two engines, a ladder truck, an SUV and the battalion chief's pickup — are operational, That was when residents began walking up to the station, seeking shelter. “Most of them were in shock,” he said, but added that nobody was seriously injured. This was the first time Fisher can remember ever having anyone shelter at the station. The captain said he has been with the fire department for 18 years. During a city Board of Directors briefing about the storm response on Monday morning, Fire Chief Delphone Hubbard said the firefighters at the station went “right to work.”  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        All North Little Rock School District schools will be open to students on Tuesday -- with the exception of Amboy Elementary that  did not have electricity as of Monday afternoon. "No school means no virtual assignments or remote learning," Superintendent Gregory Pilewski said in an afternoon message to the parents and community. "Staff will report to a designated location. In addition, we are in the process of securing a generator with the capability of providing electricity to the school in an effort to expedite its reopening. We will provide more information as it becomes available." The return to classes for most of the district's students comes in the aftermath of a tornado that left a long, wide path of destruction through Little Rock, North Little Rock, Sherwood and Jacksonville as well as in Wynne The North Little Rock district closed its campuses to students Monday, but did ask employees to report to work. Pilewski wrote Monday afternoon that bus routes were run earlier in the day and "we have determined that all bus stops are accessible and, therefore, we will be picking up students at their regular locations tomorrow morning. "In the event there is a need to change a bus stop location, we will communicate with the families that will be affected. Please be patient as the Transportation Department makes every effort to get students to and from school safely," he said. The district opened a community support center Monday afternoon until 5 p.m. at North Little Rock High School. The center is providing food, and a place for children to play while their parents and caregivers can charge up their electronic devices, take care of personal matters and seek out additional resources they may need in the wake of the violent storm.

        Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders in a news conference on Camp Robinson Monday announced two executive orders that she said aim to relieve Arkansans directly impacted by Fridays storm. The first executive order will approve paid leave for state employees that were directly impacted by the tornado Friday. Sanders said the other executive order will extend the state income tax deadline for those directly impacted by the storm. “As weve said from day one, our focus is going to be on the people first and the paperwork second,” Sanders said. “As much as we can, were trying to alleviate some of the pressure points that individuals have.” U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., joined Sanders for the news conference. “One thing Ive seen across the state is that you can destroy a building but you cant destroy the human spirit,” Cotton said. “The spirit of Arkansas has been shining strong for these last three or four days.” Cotton used most of his time at the podium urging residents to prepare for the severe weather coming into town Tuesday afternoon and into the night. “We can rebuild your homes, we can rebuild your schools, we can rebuild your business, but we cant bring you back to life,” Cotton said. “I know it may seem, sometimes, like you can ride out a storm, but the risk is simply not worth it. Please heed their warnings and follow their directions to make sure you protect yourself and your loved ones.” Sanders also warned residents across the state to keep an eye on their weather alerts over the next two days. “Arkansas is expected to have additional severe weather that comes through tomorrow,” Sanders said. “We want to make sure people are paying attention to their local officials and weather alerts that are coming in around the state. There is a large area of Arkansas that could be impacted so please pay attention to any weather alerts that you see over the course of the next 48 hours.” Also announced in the conference was the opening of a disaster relief center by FEMA in Little Rock. “Our goal is to make sure that they have a one-stop shop so that they can come in and process things on both a federal, state and city level,” Sanders said. “Any documentation that they need or specific assistance requests that they have, they can do that all from one place.” The FEMA assistance center is located at 315 N. Shackleford Rd. Facilities by FEMA in North Little Rock and Wynne are expected to open within the next 24 to 36 hours, according to Sanders. The NLR location is expected to offer assistance to those also impacted by the storms in Jacksonville. “Theres certainly a long road ahead but were making significant progress and cleaning up those communities and primarily taking care of people that need assistance right now,” Sanders said. The governor also highlighted the website — HelpArkansas.com — which launched this morning. Sanders said the site is for those who need assistance and those looking for ways to donate and volunteer. “All of those things will be in that one place to make it as simple as possible — for those who need assistance as well as those who want to help out fellow Arkansans.”  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        The Senate on Monday approved a wide-ranging criminal justice bill that aims to revamp Arkansas parole system and would require people convicted of the most violent felonies to serve the entirety of their sentences in prison. The Senate voted 29-6 to send Senate Bill 495 by Sen. Ben Gilmore, R-Crossett, to the House. The measure would create the “Protect Arkansas Act.” Along with restructuring the states parole system, SB495 aims to establish a task force to study Arkansas high rate of recidivism, launch a mental health pilot program through the state Department of Human Services and increase penalties for certain charges. The 132-page bill includes sections intended to provide incarcerated parents with greater access to their children and allow the Administrative Office of the Courts to contract attorneys to serve in specialty courts. Supporters said the bill is needed to provide stricter sentences for people convicted of serious felonies and to provide clarity to juries on how long a person will spend in prison based on their sentence. Opponents said extending prison sentences does little to deter future crime and pointed to Arkansas already high rate of incarceration. Under the bill, offenders found guilty of the most violent felonies including rape and capital murder would have to serve 100% of their sentences.  Those convicted of lesser violent felonies such as second-degree murder, battery in the first degree or sexual indecency with a child would serve 85% of their sentence before being eligible for release with supervision. People convicted of felonies not addressed in the bill could be eligible to serve 50% or 25% of their sentence depending on a seriousness grid or table established by the Arkansas Sentencing Commission and approved by the Arkansas Legislative Council. Under the states current system, Gilmore said offenders may serve only one-sixth of their sentence in prison. He noted reduced sentences may prohibit incarcerated people from completing programs in prison intended to aid with their rehabilitation.  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        All of Arkansas is at some risk of seeing hail, tornadoes and damaging winds on Tuesday evening through Wednesday morning, the National Weather Service said Monday.  Parts of the state could see some isolated and scattered storms and then a line of storms is expected to move eastward across Arkansas, said Travis Shelton, a forecaster with the National Weather Service office in North Little Rock.  Much of the state, including Little Rock, is at an enhanced risk for severe weather, a weather briefing from the National Weather Service said Monday.  An enhanced risk is defined by the weather service as numerous severe, persistent storms possible, the briefing said. After 1:30 p.m. on Monday some parts of western, northwestern and northern central Arkansas were upgraded to a moderate risk for severe weather on Tuesday evening and night, Shelton said Monday afternoon.  A moderate risk of severe weather means that widespread severe storms are likely, the briefing said.   “The threat of a few long-track tornadoes Tuesday night has prompted this upgrade,” the weather service said in a Tweet.  “By late Tuesday/early Wednesday morning, storms are expected to merge into a line and march east across the state. The main severe weather hazards with the line of storms will be damaging winds and embedded tornadoes,” a severe weather briefing from the National Weather Service said Monday.  Embedded tornadoes occur when a supercell with rotation breaks away from a line of storms, Shelton said.  “It is a very real possibility and we are worried about it,” he said.  The forecaster said the timing of these storms is a tougher part of the forecast.  “From what we know right now we will start seeing some isolated storms around Tuesday afternoon and it will continue to develop east overnight,” Shelton said.  Both the isolated storms and the line of storms could produce winds as strong as 60 mph to 80 mph, hail as big as a golf ball and potential for tornadoes, the briefing said.  Rainfall with these storms might be heavy locally but widespread heavy rain is not expected, the forecaster said.  “This is more of a thunderstorm event, not a flooding event. You can have both, but really this event isnt looking to rain so heavily,” Shelton said.  Little Rock could see up to an inch and a half rain through Friday, the briefing said. Southeastern parts of the state could see up to two inches.  “In eastern and southeastern Arkansas where the storms might slow down and not move as quickly, were worried about seeing more rainfall there,” Shelton said.  The forecaster said that Arkansans have roughly a day to prepare for the possibility of severe weather.  Shelton said Arkansans impacted by Fridays storm could seek out a community shelter nearby and make a plan about how and when to get there, if they arent able to go to their normal shelter.  “Its important to make a plan, people might also check on their neighbors and talk to them about the upcoming potential for severe weather. If your neighbor is elderly or disabled, you might plan to pick them up on the way to a community shelter,” he said.  The forecaster also said Arkansans should plan to have multiple ways to receive weather alerts ahead of Tuesday.  “If you get your information from the TV on the news, you might consider setting up notifications on Twitter or Facebook in case your power goes out,” he said,  “No way of communication is perfect.”  Those interested in getting a NOAA radio can call the weather service office and they will assist in helping program it to the right frequency over the phone, Shelton said.  “And it is important to know that tornado sirens are designed to be heard by people working outside to tell them to go inside, people should not rely on those to hear inside their homes,” the forecaster said.  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        As recovery efforts continue in Pulaski County, County Judge Barry Hyde is asking people to stay out of the damaged areas unless they live there or they are volunteers or part of a crew helping with clean-up or repair.  Madeline Roberts, spokeswoman for Hyde, said sightseers become a problem  "We are continuing to ask people, to urge them, do not go to these areas unless you have an absolutely necessary reason to be there," Roberts said. "Do not go sightseeing. The traffic — because people are coming in and want to look at everything — it's getting in the way of emergency personnel trying to do their jobs." For the people living in the affected neighborhoods, Roberts said, such behavior is an additional — and unwelcome — disruption on top of the disaster itself.  "It's just upsetting," she said. "You have people driving by and taking pictures and that's just not okay ... Stay out unless you are a resident of the area, emergency personnel, clean-up crew, volunteer, stay out. Do not go sightseeing."  Damage in the unincorporated areas of the county, Roberts said, was light with the extent being a tree blown down and a gate damaged, with the bulk of the storm's fury occurring in the cities of Little Rock, North Little Rock, Sherwood and Jacksonville. She said county officials were out Saturday with National Weather Service surveyors assessing damage and are continuing to work to provide relief to affected residents.  "Right now we're working on emergency housing," Roberts said. "Utilities continue to be a top priority because once utilities are re-established we can come in and start clearing roads but we can't do that until the lines are cleared."  Roberts said the county is also assisting with debris collection and is ready to step in to help with other recovery efforts.  "We're continuing to work with the cities and the state to see what to do next," she said,   Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         BELLA VISTA -- The back room of the Bella Vista Historical Museum was full on March 19 when the Bella Vista Historical Society held its annual meeting. Co-President Xyta Lucas said that 2022 had set a new attendance record for the all-volunteer museum and the Board of Directors are beginning the process of raising funds for another new addition on the building. The annual election took only a few minutes with members cheerfully confirming that the same three officers, Lucas, Co-President Dale Phillips and Treasurer Virginia Reynolds, will continue in the same positions for another year. Then it was time to hear from the speaker, historian Randy McCrory. McCrory is a Rogers resident and a recent retiree. He maintains the website https://www.vintagebentonville.com/ and administrates a Facebook page named Historic Benton County. His topic at the meeting was Bentonville during the Civil War. When the Civil War began, Bentonville had about 500 residents, but many of them left when the hostilities broke out, he said. The homes and other buildings left empty were burned. Some were burned by Union soldiers until a Union General put a stop to that and court-martialed the arsonists. Others may have been burned by the Confederate soldiers to keep them out of Union hands. The courthouse that was located in the middle of the square was burned, but many of the records had been hidden in Texas by Bentonville residents and eventually recovered. Before the war, Northwest Arkansas was against secession, and there were very few slaves in the area. But when the war began, many residents chose the Confederacy. "It was kind of an outlaw state," McCrory said. In fact, McCrory said, there was an illegal shoe factory hidden in a cave not far outside Bentonville. He's not sure which cave was used since it was referred to as "Shoemakers Cave," a name that didn't stick. The factory was illegal because the shoes were being made for Confederate soldiers. There were no major battles in Bentonville, but there were some skirmishes in the city. The Union troops spread out because it was easier for smaller groups to find food, and the Confederate troops would sometimes pass through. After the Battle of Pea Ridge, General Franz Sigel of the Union Army was using a hotel in Bentonville as his headquarters. He was having breakfast in the dining room when he was interrupted by a Confederate attack and ran outside carrying a piece of ham he hadn't had time to finish. Twenty five years later, Sigel returned to the hotel, took the same room and ordered the same breakfast, telling the hotel staff that he hoped he wouldn't be interrupted again. When the war ended, there were only 12 structures left in the city. Rebuilding the city was slow since funds were limited, but eventually residents returned. There were reunions for both Confederate and Union soldiers for years after the war, McCrory said. Cemeteries in the area have graves of both Union and Confederate soldiers, Phillips pointed out. He is the vice president of a group -- the Civil War Round Table -- that meets at the museum. Chuck Pribbernow, currently president of the Civil War Round Table, reminded the audience that a reenactment of the Battle of Fayetteville will take place in April.

         While Saturday was a day to gauge the breadth of the damage wrought by an EF3 tornado that crashed through the area Friday afternoon, Sunday was a day to grasp the depth of the task at hand to recover. Organizations offering food, shelter and supplies in Little Rock, North Little Rock and other affected communities did brisk business -- both from people needing and people donating -- while local officials began the work of deciding how to proceed. "We're on day three of many, many days ahead of us," said North Little Rock Police Chief Mike Davis. Also Sunday, the National Weather Service offices in North Little Rock and Memphis continued to survey the storm's damage and uncover other areas where the tornado hit, all the while keeping their eyes on another storm front expected to hit the state Tuesday. Weather service meteorologist Colby Pope said all hazards -- high winds, large hail and strong tornadoes -- are possible with the system. "I'd say that's going to be a possibility for the whole state," Pope said of the chances of high winds, large hail and even tornadoes this week. "Right now, that's what I'm looking at here." Volunteers with the First NLR Assembly of God church in North Little Rock stood outside one wing of the building Sunday afternoon passing out tarps, food, water, cleaning supplies, toys for kids and more. "We're the designated spot for drop-offs in the city of NLR," one volunteer said. "About every other car is a drop-off and about every other car is a pick-up. We've gone through two 18-wheeler trucks of food and supplies in the last 24 hours. We're not asking for any information. If you're asking for it, we're giving it." According to another volunteer with the church, donations from community members had wrapped around the building by Saturday afternoon. A truck from Amazon's disaster relief was scheduled to drop off a new load of supplies Sunday evening.    "The biggest need right now is tarps, boxes and containers for people to put their stuff in," the volunteer added. "Since we're the city-designated we have 18-wheelers come and unload supplies here and then city services and trailers head out into communities like Levy because they can't get big trucks in." The church, which is located at 4501 Burrow Drive, is operating from around 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. every day of the week. On Murray Street in Little Rock, members of the Little Rock Fire Academy are working alongside Goodwill to collect and distribute supplies to community members. Residents dropped off non-perishables, toiletries, water and more from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. "Yesterday we transported about 70 palettes of goods," Little Rock's Communications Director Aaron Sadler said. "I think we've hundreds and hundreds of cars come through." Beginning today, the city of Little Rock will open a Family Assistance Center at 315 N. Shackleford Road, Mayor Frank Scott Jr. said Sunday. The Family Assistance Center is a partnership with Engage Arkansas, Arkansas Baptist Disaster Relief, the Salvation Army, the Wolfe Street Foundation, the Center for Youth and Families, Immanuel Baptist Church, Goodwill Industries, and the United Way. "We are united in our commitment to serve those who were impacted by this storm as we move forward together to rebuild," Scott said. "I'm humbled by the outpouring of support from not just this community, but from around the world." The center will provide water, food, and supplies, and people may also request volunteer chainsaw crews through the center who will assist residents with tree removal and tarp placement. FEMA representatives will be onsite for residents who need federal assistance. NLR SCHOOLS CLOSED TODAY North Little Rock School District Superintendent Greg Pilewski said all schools will be closed for students today, though staff and faculty are to report to their schools. The day will be used to further learn about faculty's needs during this time, the plan for bus routes in affected areas and ensuring that power is back to all of the schools. The district's "tentative" plan is to have students and staff back in school Tuesday. "We think [Monday] is going to be a big transition day and we're going to learn a lot," Pilewski said. Mayor Terry Hartwick said North Little Rock has hired an Alabama company to help facilitate the cleanup. The group -- CrowderGulf, LLC -- works with communities needing assistance with disaster recovery, debris removal and coastal restoration services.  Sherwood Mayor Mary Jo Heye-Townsell said her city will also contract with CrowderGulf to assist in clean-up efforts in their city. Davis said even with the contractor, the city will still need help during the coming weeks as everyone "goes back to work." "If you haven't done anything up until now, don't think 'hey, it's over, I don't have to worry about it now,'" he said. "We need more in the next few weeks." LITTLE ROCK EFFORTS At a Sunday morning news conference at the heavily damaged Colony West shopping center off North Rodney Parham Road, where the sound of chain saws and heavy equipment nearly drowned out the speakers, Scott said the city is working toward recovery. "We're going to try and get operations back to as smooth as possible," Scott said. "It's going to probably take months for a lot of these residential communities, as well as our commercial activity, to get back to normal. It's our first priority to do all we can to rebuild and recover for the residents of Little Rock and Central Arkansas." City staff and community members have spent the days following the Friday storm coming together to clear roadways, provide free meals to those in need and offer their services where they can, the mayor said. FEMA representatives highlighted that their assistance can be used in many ways by those affected by the storm. Speakers with the federal organization reminded people that not every person's impact story will look the same or require the same assistance. Those seeking help from the agency will discuss what services are needed and will be directed to the necessary resources and help, they said. Pamela Smith, spokeswoman for the Little Rock School District, said school will open district-wide as normal this morning after assessments over the weekend determined that no school district property was damaged. Smith said there are some remaining problems with communications, particularly internet service, due to widespread damage to utility poles. "We have crews working to get that repaired because that impacts our communications district-wide," Smith said. "We have different sites that feed into different schools in clusters and some of the lines are in the air and as a result of the storm damage, it caused a fiber issue at some of our sites." Smith said over the weekend efforts were made to ensure that bus routes would be unimpeded. POWER-PACKED STORM The National Weather Service office in North Little Rock has confirmed that the EF3 tornado, with winds reaching 165 miles per hour, cut a path of destruction through the metro area that stretched for 32 miles before the twister dissipated. Information on the weather service website said the tornado touched down at 2:22 p.m. and ran along a northwest track through Pulaski and Lonoke counties before it dissipated at 2:57 p.m. just south of Cabot cutting a 600-yard-wide path at its widest. Pope, the weather service staff meteorologist, said Sunday that surveyors have determined that the worst damage in central Arkansas was along a northeast track from the North Shackleford Road area into west Little Rock before the storm crossed the Arkansas River into North Little Rock. Pope said surveyors are also investigating an area in Garland County near Pine Mountain where damage reports were received. He said the storm cell that passed over Garland County is the same one that produced the tornado that initially touched down in Little Rock. "We want to make sure it wasn't on the ground earlier in the Hot Springs vicinity," Pope said. "We're also trying to confirm reports of possible damage in Stone County and also in Prairie County, near and just northeast of Des Arc, so those will be some places we'll be surveying in coming days. Sometimes we get damage reports that turn out to be straight-line winds but we have to conduct a survey to know for sure." Pope said it will take several days to complete the surveys and to release final information on the storms. The National Weather Service office in Memphis, which is responsible for eastern Arkansas including Cross County, said a preliminary report has determined the tornado that struck Wynne, destroying much of the town including the high school, was likely an EF3, but said final determinations of wind speed, the width and length of the tornado track and total damage estimates will take time because of widespread damage in Tennessee and Mississippi associated with Friday's storms. Sheana Walsh, a staff meteorologist with the Memphis office, said more information will be made available in coming days and survey teams continue inspecting the area. "They're still out in the field, still surveying," Walsh said. "This could be a days thing but we're comfortable right now with a preliminary reading of EF3 for that particular tornado." Pope said there is concern regarding a system approaching from the west that could bring another round of severe weather as early as Tuesday. Some rain was forecast for the area Sunday night as the warm front begins moving closer to the state. "This is going to prime the environment for the potential on Tuesday," he said. "We'll see a lot more moisture and a lot warmer temperatures that we'll notice Monday and even during the day on Tuesday. We expect the next round of severe weather, at least the potential for severe weather, will be late Tuesday afternoon into Tuesday night." On the heels of that system, Pope said, is a cold front that is expected to move into the state on Wednesday before stalling and becoming stationary near the Gulf of Mexico. That, he said, will funnel moisture into Arkansas through the end of the week, making rain more likely. "Between now and Friday," he said, "across far southern Arkansas, we could see anywhere from three to six inches of rain. The central part of the state could get anywhere from a half-inch to two inches of rain and across northern Arkansas, they could see from a few tenths of an inch to upwards of an inch." PERSISTENT POWER OUTAGES As the storms moved through, in addition to damage to homes and businesses, electrical service was interrupted to 56,000 Entergy Arkansas customers throughout the state. An Entergy Arkansas spokeswoman, Brandi Hinkle, said that as of Sunday evening, those outages had been reduced to 12,050 statewide and more than 3,000 linemen were working to restore existing outages. "We've actually restored about 50,000 but that's because sometimes the power goes on and goes off, depending on the weather, trees continue to fall, limbs and things like that," Hinkle said. "Also, we've had a lot of debris, not just tree limbs but roof shingles, trash, piles of debris that we have to maneuver around to get to the power lines ... and these happen to be in heavily populated neighborhoods where we can't just pull up in a bucket truck. We have to use a lot of specialized equipment." With damage to Entergy's equipment 95% scouted and assessed, Hinkle said, crews are working to replace 1,500 damaged power poles, 400 transformers and some 2,000 spans of wire. Once the work is complete, however, Hinkle said much of the replaced infrastructure will be better able to withstand severe weather when it occurs. "We're replacing the broken power poles with larger poles and in some instances, concrete poles, so they should be more resilient going forward," she said. "That doesn't mean they're going to be tornado proof, but we do hope they will be more resilient going forward, because some of these power poles that were blown down are decades old. We don't necessarily replace poles unless they are damaged or decaying, but this is a great opportunity to put newer equipment up." Hinkle said Entergy officials are keeping a close eye on the sky over the next several days as the weather system moves closer to the state that is predicted to bring more severe weather, which could complicate restoration efforts. "A lot of the damage at this point is going to be small areas that are going to be difficult to access," she said. "Typically, what we try to do is get the most people back on at a time along with our critical customers like hospitals, schools, churches, things like that." Much of the remaining damage, Hinkle said, is in densely populated neighborhoods that take time to get into with the proper equipment, a process which she said takes time. "We do have additional crews in town but a lot of the damage that's left is going to be in those neighborhoods and in backyards," she said. To meet the challenge, Hinkle said Entergy Arkansas has, in addition to the 3,000 "boots on the ground," additional crews called in from Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas, as well as customer service representatives, schedulers, logistics personnel and others. "It's an all-hands storm response," she said. "That's not unusual for us. We stay storm ready year-round because unfortunately in Arkansas we have to deal with storms, with ice, snow and we've had some of the worst tornadoes in history in March and April." Weather events in Arkansas the past several years have tended to be extreme, Hinkle said. "We've had the polar vortex, we actually had a hurricane that came this far inland, and of course, we have thunderstorms and tornadoes that cause a lot of damage," she said. "We have to stay storm prepped year-round." As of Sunday night, Hinkle said, Little Rock still had 7,276 customers without power, Wynne had 2,478, Jacksonville had 2,157, Sherwood had 430, and Cammack Village had 203. According to the outage map on its website, North Little Rock Electric had just under 8,000 outages Sunday night. PRICE GOUGING Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin said in a statement issued on Sunday that with the emergency declaration issued by Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the state's anti-price gouging law, which prohibits businesses from increasing prices more than 10% above pre-disaster prices on goods such as food, water, fuel, blankets, medical supplies and construction materials, is now in effect. Griffin said the price gouging law is triggered whenever a state of emergency is declared by federal, state or local governments, and violations can carry fines of up to $10,000. Griffin said his office has received several phone calls from people concerned with price gouging, including one regarding a person from Mississippi looking for work clearing trees and other debris. "He indicated his understanding was that our law allows him to double or even triple his prices during a storm," Griffin said. "We reached out and we educated him very quickly on Arkansas law. ... We straightened him out on what Arkansas law allows, what it doesn't allow and hopefully we won't hear any complaints about him." Griffin said several other complaints, including one from eastern Arkansas concerning tree removal and another regarding room rates at a North Little Rock motel, are being investigated. Several other complaints, he said, have been investigated and found to be legitimate service fees. "It's not just a matter of whether you've raised your price," he said. "It's whether you raised it by a certain amount and whether you raised it for no reason. Certainly, if necessary, people need to be able to pay double overtime. If someone wants their tree removed immediately, that's going to cost more than a situation where it may be two weeks, that sort of thing." Griffin said so far his office has stepped in before a violation of the law occurred, but he said for the duration of the emergency anyone with concerns regarding price gouging should contact his office.   Gallery: Sunday Tornado Coverage  Print Headline: Cities look ahead to tornado recovery Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        As school district leaders in Arkansas look ahead to their first year under the LEARNS Act, many have expressed a mix of optimism and wariness over what changes the education overhaul will bring for their staff members, students and their families. The LEARNS Act has been the top priority for Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders since she took office in January. The bill, hailed by Sanders as "the largest overhaul of the state's education system in Arkansas history," includes school vouchers, raises for beginning teachers from $36,000 to $50,000 and by $2,000 for others, a dual diploma program for high school students learning a trade, and a repeal of the Teacher Fair Dismissal Act. Department of Education Secretary Jacob Oliva described the 145-page law as "a holistic approach that streamlines a fragmented system from cradle to career and addresses everything." "It gives the state board, the school districts, teachers, leaders, the ability to make the decisions that work best for the students that they serve," he said. Oliva said LEARNS is "about investing in local public schools," adding that he believes they "should be the first and best choice" for students and their families. If those schools are unable to meet a family's needs, "then parents should have the flexibility to have some choices," he said. [READ MORE: What you need to know about the LEARNS Act » arkansasonline.com/learns] Sanders campaigned on a broad outline of education change that called for parental empowerment, new literacy standards and accountability for teachers, but she didn't disclose details of her plan until Feb. 8. The LEARNS Act was signed into law exactly one month later. Mountain Home School District Superintendent Brent Howard said the fast pace of the overhaul, from its introduction to signing, has left district leaders with questions about the limits of LEARNS' funding and the consequences it will have. Though Howard said he is confident his district can weather any challenges that come its way, the 27-year education veteran admitted the large volume of questions he still has have left him "really worried." "I've never experienced anything like this in my life," he said. "I've never seen anything be rushed through with the speed that this bill has had." SCHOOL EMPLOYEE WAGES District officials have expressed widespread appreciation for the salary increases provided to teachers. "They truly deserve it," said Jay Chalk, Clinton School District superintendent. Chalk joined other superintendents in voicing concerns about the limits of LEARNS' funding for educators and other school staff, though. In addition to leaving districts to decide for themselves to what degree they can reward educators' experience and education, any raises districts plan to give for classified staff, such as bus drivers, custodians and cafeteria workers, or employees in federally funded positions must be funded through other sources. Districts will continue to receive per-pupil funding through the adequacy process. That process determines how much the state will spend on public schools for the next two years. The per-student foundation funding is the largest part of state funding for public education. Schools also receive supplemental state and federal funds for education. House Bill 1688 calls for an increase in the per-student foundation funding by $205 to $7,618 for the 2023-2024 school year. For the 2024-2025 school year, the legislation calls for the per-student funding to increase to $7,771. The per-pupil funding for the 2022-2023 school year is $7,413. The bill advanced by a state House committee on Thursday includes a $2-an-hour increase for classified staff. Despite the increase, Harrison School District Superintendent Stewart Pratt said he is among district leaders who are concerned about retaining employees with raises not covered by LEARNS, including classified staff. His district has roughly 200 classified employees, and about 216 licensed staff, according to Pratt. He said many districts, including Harrison, try to build a culture that encourages people to work there. However, they must compete with other industries, such as fast food, with large sign-on bonuses and $15-an-hour starting wages. "It's hard for [classified staff] to look at their family and say I'm staying because of 'culture' when I've got a $2 an hour differential between the school and businesses downtown," Pratt said. Bentonville School District Superintendent Debbie Jones said such classified employees are critical to schools. "The district does not run if we don't have enough bus drivers," she said. "They're as necessary as teachers." Her district will recommend raises for its classified staff, according to Jones. Pratt said that districts must aim to provide a salary that not only retains cafeteria workers, custodians and other classified staff, but also ensures that they feel like they can survive at home. "We've got to find a way to make sure that our team, all team members, feel supported monetarily," he said. "Not just licensed staff." The Harrison superintendent remained optimistic about his district's ability to retain employees, despite any challenges they face. "We've got great people in Harrison and I trust our bus drivers and our cooks, our custodians, maintenance staff," he said. "They are really, really good people. I just want to take care of them." Regarding the foundation funding bill working its way through the Legislature, Jacksonville North Pulaski Superintendent Jeremy Owoh likewise said that "any suggested increase is definitely appreciated and needed." The superintendent described the expectation that the funding would increase over time as a "positive." Owoh pointed out, though, that lawmakers in November recommended a higher figure for the next school year. The House Education Committee recommended $8,129 per pupil, while the Senate Education Committee recommended $8,150. House Education Chair Brian Evans, one of the bill's sponsors, said the per-student funding was less than what lawmakers initially proposed because there isn't a need to increase insurance for full-time staff. The bill calls for the school districts to pay a health insurance contribution rate set by the General Assembly. HB1688 will next go to the House of Representatives for a vote. Chalk, the Clinton School District superintendent, said the wait for approval on foundation funding figures is difficult, especially as the end of the school year approaches. "We're running out of time, and we're having to wait to hear from the state what's going to be," he said. "That's my one hope that keeps me hanging on." According to Owoh, the Jacksonville North Pulaski district likes to issue its contracts by May 1. "We're in the season of constructing new teacher, all-staff contracts, so we need some decisions to be made sooner [rather] than later," he said. OTHER AREAS Owoh expressed enthusiasm for the support LEARNS provides for improving school security, as it has been a key focus for his district. "That's something we've made a priority since Day 1," he said. Included in LEARNS are calls for the creation of district safety and security teams, new training requirements for school resource officers and "comprehensive" school safety assessments. "It's sad, it's unfortunate that we have to go to the next level in securing our buildings and providing additional safety," Owoh said. "But when I hear my students say they feel safe, it's definitely worth those additional safety measures." COMMUNICATION Oliva is visiting Arkansas' 15 educational cooperatives to talk with district leaders about improving education and answer questions about LEARNS. "I think it's important to know that our agency is working with districts, every single district to answer all of their questions, and to identify opportunities that we can make sure that we're implementing this initiative with fidelity, and we're going to continue to do so," he said. The cooperative meetings are not open to the public, said Kimberly Mundell, spokeswoman for the state Department of Education. Beyond these meetings, Oliva said the agency is responding to districts' questions about LEARNS. "A district might call and say 'Can you explain the numbers in this category? Which teachers were calculated? Which ones weren't?'" he said. According to Oliva, such communication has helped districts to come around to being more comfortable with implementing the education overhaul. "The feedback that we've gotten from pretty much everyone is everybody feels a lot better about understanding what we're trying to do," he said. Owoh said he was unable to attend his cooperative's meeting, but received notes from the session and was kept informed on how it went. During the meeting with Owoh's cooperative, Oliva acknowledged unknowns remained regarding the implementation of LEARNS and that amendments were likely, the superintendent said. Mike Hernandez, executive director of the Arkansas Association of Educational Administrators, said clear communication between the state, districts and their staff will be critical as the state moves to implement LEARNS. "That part gives me some concern," he said. "Obviously, we have a way that we've been doing things for a long time, and when you change there's a lot of opportunity for people that are upset and not understanding that." Hernandez said he is confident communication will become clearer as implementation moves forward. Owoh said he has been working to keep educators and staff at the Jacksonville North Pulaski School District informed on the process. "They're just wanting to hear from me face-to-face on how this is going to impact the profession moving forward," the superintendent said. Owoh said he understood the concerns district staff members have expressed about the law, including questions about due process. The superintendent described himself as fortunate for being able to attend sessions about LEARNS at the Capitol. "There's a lot of unknowns from people who are actually involved," he said. "So imagine the concerns from those who are not directly involved." Information for this article was contributed by Neal Earley of the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette.

         WASHINGTON -- Former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson will run for president in 2024, he told ABC News on Sunday. A spokesperson for Hutchinson's campaign confirmed to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette Hutchinson's intent to run and said it would begin with an April 26 event in Bentonville. Hutchinson made his intentions clear Sunday following months of speculation and had teased of a pending announcement. He spent part of last week speaking in Iowa, a key state in the presidential election season. "As I've traveled the country for six months, I hear people talk about the leadership of our country," he said. "I'm convinced people want leaders that appeal to the best of America, and not simply appeal to our worst instincts." Hutchinson, 72, enters the race with experience in state and federal politics. A former Arkansas Republican Party chairman, Hutchinson represented the state's 3rd Congressional District from January 1997 to August 2001, which included serving as a manager during the impeachment trial of fellow Arkansan and then-President Bill Clinton. Hutchinson resigned from the U.S. House of Representatives to become administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration. He joined the Department of Homeland Security in January 2003 and served as the undersecretary on border and transportation security until March 2005. Hutchinson ran for governor of Arkansas in 2006, losing to Democrat Mike Beebe. He sought the office again in 2014, winning that year's race and a 2018 bid for a second term. His record as governor includes income tax reductions, computer science education expansion and leading the state through the coronavirus pandemic, as well as a near-complete prohibition on abortion services and overhauling Arkansas' Medicaid program. He left office in January because of term limits. Prior to entering public office, Hutchinson served as U.S. attorney for Arkansas' Western District. He successfully prosecuted a white supremacist group -- The Covenant, the Sword and the Arm of the Lord -- which involved negotiating an end to a standoff between the organization and law enforcement agencies.    "There's not a lot of people on the national stage that have served at all the different levels that he has served at," said Jon Gilmore, a longtime Hutchinson aide and chairman of a pro-Hutchinson super PAC. "As you look at Gov. Hutchinson, I think his call to public service is clear. I think his call to serve is clear, and I think he wants to be an alternative. Whether that means he's successful or not in that run, I think, at the end of the day, he's doing it for the right reasons, which is the American people need to hear alternative voices to Joe Biden and former President [Donald] Trump."    Trump was the first Republican to enter the race when he announced a third presidential campaign in November. Following Trump's indictment by a Manhattan grand jury Thursday, Hutchinson -- a critic of Trump's denial of the 2020 election results -- called on Trump to drop out, striking a different tone from that of other Republicans who have labeled the inquiry a politically motivated affair. "I think it's a sad day for America that we have a former president that's indicted," Hutchinson told ABC News. "It's a great distraction, but at the same time, we can't set aside what our Constitution requires, which is electing a new leader for our country, just because we have this side controversy and criminal charges that are pending." Gilmore said he believes there is fatigue over Trump that will help Hutchinson's chances at a successful White House bid. "I think at this time, it's time to move on. The people I talk to are ready to see change," he said. Gilmore additionally drew from the experiences of himself and others in past election cycles when Republicans backed Trump after he became the party's presidential candidate. "President Trump had his time. He actually had good policies for America, but his rhetoric was also damaging," he said. "At the end of the day, he had the opportunity [and] he lost the race for the presidency. I think he needs to go back and focus on his own issues that he's got going on in his life and his business and let someone else come to the forefront of the Republican Party." Former South Carolina governor and United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley launched her presidential campaign in February, as did entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy. U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton of Little Rock has opted not to run for president in 2024 after considering a possible White House bid. More Republicans are expected to announce their presidential ambitions in the coming months. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has emerged as Trump's top opponent. The governor released a book last week, "The Courage to Be Free: Florida's Blueprint for America's Revival," laying out his vision for America. "This is one of the most unpredictable political environments that I've seen in my lifetime," Hutchinson said. "My message of experience, of consistent conservatism, of hope for our future and solving problems that face Americans, I think that resonates," he said. "Whenever I make the final announcement, I'll be everywhere, and I think it's a plan that can work in this environment." Jamie Harrison, chair of the Democratic National Committee, struck against Hutchinson's announcement, criticizing the former governor's record in office. "After calling Donald Trump 'the kind of transparent, straight-talking leader America needs,' Asa Hutchinson now wants to rewrite history -- but his support for Trump and the MAGA agenda speaks for itself," Harrison said. "As governor, Hutchinson signed one of the strictest abortion bans in the country, ripped health care away from thousands of Arkansans, and advocated for taking away the [Affordable Care Act's] protections for those with preexisting conditions. He's just another extremist joining the ever-expanding race for the MAGA base." Other Arkansans who have run for president include retired Army Gen. Wesley Clark; former first lady, U.S. senator and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton; and former Gov. Mike Huckabee, who is also the father of current Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Huckabee has already announced his endorsement of Trump. Arkansas' Rep. Bruce Westerman of Hot Springs told the Democrat-Gazette that he welcomed the former governor's entry into the race. "Governor Hutchinson is a lifetime Republican who fought for conservatism decades before Arkansas flipped almost overnight from a solid blue to a solid red state," Westerman said in a statement. "From serving in the Reagan administration to Congress to the George W. Bush administration and eventually as Governor of Arkansas, Asa Hutchinson has always served with the highest character and integrity and will strengthen the 2024 presidential election by adding his service and accomplishments to the debate." Sanders has not made any public endorsement regarding the presidential election. Sanders' position is unique in that she served as White House press secretary under Trump before succeeding Hutchinson as governor in January. When previously asked about 2024 and possibly endorsing Trump, she stated she was more focused on how to best serve Arkansans. Hutchinson's interview with ABC News aired as Sanders and state officials continued to evaluate damage from Friday's tornadoes in Arkansas. Federal officials are working with Sanders and local leaders on assessing the storms' impact. "The Governor is focused right now on helping Arkansans impacted by the storms as we work to recover and rebuild," Sanders spokesperson Alexa Henning told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette on Sunday. Republican Party of Arkansas Chairman Cody Hiland issued a similar statement. "I can certainly appreciate why you would ask, but presidential politics are the last thing on the minds of Arkansans as we continue recovering from a tornado that devastated parts of our state two days ago," he said. "Our thoughts and prayers continue to be with folks in the Little Rock metro area and Wynne."  Print Headline: Hutchinson running for president Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         School officials in storm-ravaged Wynne are hoping to get students back to class in one week's time after Friday's confirmed EF3 tornado tore through the city, destroying its high school and other community fixtures. Wynne School District Superintendent Kenneth Moore said officials are looking at ways to resume classes by April 10, including assessing the district's intermediate school to see if part of it can be salvaged for grades to combine and learning to resume. Moore said he met with Arkansas Secretary of Education Jacob Oliva for three hours Saturday to get a plan together, and his administrative team met again Sunday morning.    "We know that in a time like this, when we get back to normal as quick as possible, it really helps our students," Moore said. "We are going to have additional counselors available, because we know that even if we have a thunderstorm -- there's trauma that our kids have gone through -- our staff have gone through -- and so we want to make sure we've got that extra level of support for them." He said the district also is trying to determine how many families have access to Wi-Fi and laptops for possible remote learning, and Oliva is looking at ways to get additional devices to students.     On Sunday, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders joined Oliva and Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Deanne Criswell to survey the wreckage of Wynne High School with Moore and Wynne Mayor Jennifer Hobbs. After touring the campus, Oliva said the damage equated to "hands down" the worst "impacted storm events" he has seen on a school campus. "We're very grateful to the district and their leadership to make sure that throughout this event students are safe," he added. "We are going to be here on site every single day so we can stand arm [in] arm and hand in hand and one day welcome our students back into our classrooms." Sanders agreed: It was an "unbelievably tragic moment." The governor noted that Moore brought her to a spot inside the remains of the school, where all the walls had caved in except for two. On one was a mural of Wynne and on the other was a message: "Once a yellow jacket, always a yellow jacket." "I think those two things really symbolize what this community is -- could not be more proud than to be governor of Arkansas because of what communities like this and all across our state represent," Sanders said. "People coming together, standing up, knowing that no matter what challenges we face, nothing is going to destroy us. Nothing is going to bring us down. "If anything we will come back better and stronger," she said. "That doesn't mean it's an easy road. We have a long road. But I can assure you that the people behind me are up to the task." The governor commended state Sen. Ronald Caldwell, state Rep. Steve Hollowell, and school and city leadership for their efforts after the tornado struck. "I've been very clear that our perspective is that people are going to come first and the paperwork will come second," Sanders said. "Whatever it takes to bring aid and resources and assistance to the people of Arkansas. That's what we're gonna deliver." She also thanked Criswell and FEMA for delivering resources to meet victims' needs. Another effort Sanders recognized was that of Wynne students who found an American flag and a Wynne High School flag to fly outside the destroyed campus. "I think that should make all of us very proud, not just as a community, but as the next generation coming behind us," she said. "And the people that we know will be running this town once it's rebuilt. I have every confidence that Wynne is going to come back better, bigger and stronger. I can't tell you how proud I am to be here today and stand with this community." Criswell addressed concerns about more storms and tornadoes predicted to hit the region Tuesday. She said debris removal underway will aid in preventing more destruction, and the governor's approved request for a presidential disaster declaration will help reimburse those costs. "What I want people to do; what they need to know right now is that they need to listen to what the weather forecasts are," she emphasized. "They need to know how they're going to get their alerts and how they're going to get that emergency warning, know where they're gonna go. I think we've heard great stories of survival, and we want to make sure that we continue to hear those stories, so having people really pay attention and know what they're gonna do to protect themselves and their family is the most important." Had technology not delivered on time and given proper warnings, "we'd be looking at a very different situation," Sanders said. "Thankfully we're not," she said. "I'm hopeful ... people will continue to follow the alerts. Pay attention to the notices and the weather alerts that are coming and listen to your city and local officials that are giving you guidance on where you can go, where you can be safely and not to take these things for granted." Sanders also applauded volunteers who came from other cities, hours away, to help in the aftermath. "The level of people and volunteers that we have seen is frankly staggering," Sanders said. "It's one of the reasons I'm so proud to be governor of Arkansas is because our people are so good. It is by far the greatest asset, the state of Arkansas has is the goodness of the people here and we have seen that in droves." Sanders closed her remarks by reassuring the public that FEMA's partnership with the state is "extremely important" for the long haul of recuperation efforts. Criswell said schools are the hearts of communities, "and we want to make sure that we get the Yellowjackets back here, right, that we have them back in their school because that's where the heart of the community is." "As we look to the long-term recovery, we're going to partner with the governor," she added. We are here for the long haul, governor, we are going to be with you through this process. We know that this journey is going to be long, but the programs that we have to help support the rebuilding of this community is what comes with this presidential disaster declaration."   Gallery: Sanders Tours Wynne Tornado Damage  Print Headline: Wynne works on returning kids to school Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         A jury will consider the revocation of USA Metal Recycling's conditional use permit by the city of Lowell. The trial in Benton County Circuit Court is set to begin Dec. 3, 2024, according to a Feb. 28 order signed by Judge Xollie Duncan. USA Metal Recycling was ordered to cease operations six months ago when the Lowell Planning Commission revoked the company's permit on Oct. 3. The City Council affirmed the revocation Dec. 20 after determining the business hadn't resolved safety issues at its site, such as creating adequate fire lanes. The business filed a notice of appeal Jan. 18 concerning the city's decision. According to state law, certain decisions by municipal bodies can be appealed to county circuit court. USA Metal's notice of appeal requested a trial by jury and did not outline an argument against the permit revocation. Lowell officials maintain that the decision was "lawful and legitimate," according to a response from the city and its attorney, Tom Kieklak, filed Feb. 17. Council Member Eric Schein asked Tom Smith of USA Metal at the Dec. 20 meeting why he would appeal the permit revocation rather than apply for a new permit, which he said may be faster and simpler. The process of approving a conditional use permit can take less than a month, said Karen Davis, the city's community development director. Smith said his business shouldn't have been shut down and he wanted the city to reverse its decision. "A barrage of misinformation" led to a rushed decision by the commission, he told the council during the meeting. "At this point, I've got nothing to lose," Smith said at the meeting. "I'm out of money and out of business. If you put someone in a corner like that, it's a bad place to be." The business has disagreed with representatives of the city about what the conditional use permit allowed. The permit granted to the business at 721 S. Lincoln St. allowed metal recycling, but not other materials, which were documented at the scene of a fire last year, according to Davis. The business presented itself as a metal recycling facility, according to an Aug. 5 cease-and-desist letter from Davis to Smith. Smith said there were no conditions on the conditional use permit received in 2009; deadlines given by the commission last year were "virtually impossible" for the business to meet; and city staff refused his attempts at communication throughout the process. The name of the business implies that it only recycles metal, though its plan has been to also recycle byproducts such as cardboard boxes and shrink-wrap, he said. Mayor Chris Moore said in December that city staff hadn't been ignoring Smith. The Aug. 2 fire was in material dumped on a lot just north of the 721 S. Lincoln St. address, Davis said. That lot is part of USA Metal's permit, she said. Material intended to be recycled through USA Metal was also found on a third northernmost lot, which isn't part of the company's permit, nor associated with any business license, she said. The site was being used to dump debris from Smith's construction company, Redline Contractors, according to a Sept. 8 letter from Davis to the Planning Commission. Debris blocked fire crews' access to the Aug. 2 fire, according to a Fire Department report. Crews were forced to access the fire through the north lot because fire lanes were blocked in the south and middle lots, Davis said. Firefighters reported arriving at the scene at 5:31 p.m. and leaving just after midnight. The city ordered USA Metal to halt operations Aug. 5, stating that records from the Arkansas Department of Energy and Environment showed that the business recycled construction material at 721 S. Lincoln St. and reported a "change of business" to a construction demolition recycling facility in 2016. The business' conditional use permit never allowed material such as construction debris at the site, according to the cease-and-desist letter from the city. USA Metal continued operating after the cease-and-desist order, Davis said. On Aug. 10, the Planning Commission ordered the business to follow the conditional use permit, clean up construction and demolition debris at the site within a week and comply with state regulations to remediate water in a pond. The commission voted Sept. 8 to recommend extending the conditional use permit with conditions through Oct. 3, giving the business a list of required actions. Before the commission's decision to revoke the permit Oct. 3, city Special Services Director Richard Stone said USA Metal had moved all its equipment and debris to its property and communicated with the Stormwater Management Department, but hadn't shown completion of any of the other tasks.

         Former Arkansas Supreme Court Justice Robert Hamilton "Bob" Dudley died Saturday. Dudley served on the Supreme Court for 16 years before retiring at the end of his last term in December 1996. "He was not only one of the state's foremost jurists but also a historian, a storyteller and a great public servant," said Rex Nelson, a columnist for the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. Nelson said he got to know Dudley later in the judge's life after the judge began writing essays and stories for historical quarterly publications. Former Gov. Mike Beebe, who led the state from 2007-15, said Dudley minced no words. "He was a passionate jurist," Beebe said. "What he believed, he believed really strongly to the point of being vocal about it." Supreme Court Chief Justice Dan Kemp said Dudley was considered a friend. "He was instrumental from his influence from the time he served on the trial bench and his long tenure on the appellate bench as well," Kemp said. Annabelle Imber Tuck replaced Dudley on the bench when he retired. She recalled that Dudley was still at work until the bitter end of his days on the court. "He was still plowing away," Tuck said. "He was still writing an opinion. That was just the kind of justice he was. He was going to make sure this case got handled and was concluded before he retired." Dudley was born Nov. 18, 1933, in Jonesboro. He was the son of Denver Layton Dudley, who was a lawyer, and Helen Paslay Dudley, a schoolteacher and clinical psychologist. His father was elected to a term in the state House of Representatives from Craighead County in 1924 and served as prosecuting attorney during the Great Depression in a district that stretched from the Missouri border into Central Arkansas. His father prosecuted two Black men who were convicted of raping a white woman and were executed in the nationally infamous Arkansas "Scottsboro" Case in 1935. As a youngster, Dudley was called "Little Judge," owing to the family lineage, according to the Central Arkansas Library's Encyclopedia of Arkansas. Dudley attended George Washington University in Washington, D.C. He returned to Arkansas and completed a bachelor's degree in history, and in 1958 he earned a law degree from the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville. After college, Dudley joined a former circuit judge, John L. Bledsoe, in a general law practice in Pocahontas. In 1964, he ran for prosecuting attorney for the five counties of the 16th Judicial District and won handily. He served three terms and in 1970 was elected judge for the 8th Chancery District, which encompassed nine counties in eastern and Central Arkansas. In 1980, he ran for an open seat on the Arkansas Supreme Court and again won easily. He was reelected without opposition in 1988 and retired at the end of the term in 1996, according to the Arkansas Encyclopedia. During his 16 years on the Supreme Court, Dudley concurred in the court's order that the state's public schools were being operated illegally because the state had failed to provide the funds or a method of distributing aid to ensure that every child had a suitable education. In another one of his decisions, the court ordered Jennings Osborne, a wealthy Little Rock businessman, to remove a popular Christmas light display that was a nuisance to neighbors, according to the encyclopedia.

         An estimated 1,800 transgender-identifying youths living in Arkansas face a dilemma following a wave of anti-trans legislation that passed through the Arkansas General Assembly in recent weeks -- legislation which its opponents say endangers their health, their mental well-being and even their lives. In Arkansas in 2023, nine separate bills affecting gender-affirming health care, speech and education have either passed or are currently advancing through the General Assembly. Supporters say the bills protect kids from harmful therapies and sexually deviant behavior. Opponents of those bills say transgender teens and adults are being singled out for discrimination. Senate Bill 199, enacted as Act 274 of 2023, extends the statute of limitations for anyone receiving transgender care as a minor in Arkansas to file a malpractice suit to 15 years after the minor turns 18. State law restricts all other malpractice claims to a two-year statute of limitations. House Bill 1156, enacted as Act 312 of 2023, requires public school and open-enrollment charter school students to use a restroom that corresponds to the gender listed on their birth certificate or to use a single-occupancy restroom. Senate Bill 270, currently advancing through the Legislature, would make it illegal for an adult to enter a public restroom designated for the opposite gender from their birth gender "for the purpose of arousing or gratifying a sexual desire," an amendment that was added after concerns were raised that the bill was too broad. As originally written, the bill would have made it a crime of sexual indecency with a child for an adult to enter a public restroom designated for the gender opposite of their birth gender for any reason if a minor is present. Other bills would prohibit teachers and other school employees from using transgender students' preferred pronouns or referring to their proclaimed gender identity without written parental consent. Most of the bills signed into law or that have cleared most of the committee hearing hurdles have received approval despite much opposition voiced during public hearings. Some parents of transgender teens have said that if necessary, they will leave Arkansas to find a more inclusive and welcoming place for their families, which is an option for those who have the means to do so. But with an estimated 30% of transgender people nationally living below the poverty line and job insecurity a reality for many others, for many picking up stakes and starting over isn't an option. Population estimates in Arkansas set the adult transgender population at 16,200, accounting for .7% of Arkansans 18 and older, according to the UCLA Williams Institute. Transgender teens between ages 13 and 17 are estimated to number 1,800 people, making up .88% of the population in that age group. No estimates for transgender minors younger than 13 were available. According to the Human Rights Campaign, a pro-LGBTQ organization, nationally, 30% of the estimated 1.6 million transgender teens and adults live in poverty. Individuals and groups in Arkansas are working to identify available resources and support for transgender individuals and their families that can help with everything from emotional to financial support. Max Calabotta, development coordinator and organizer for Intransitive, a transgender-led organization that maintains a community center in Little Rock, said their organization puts on community events and helps provide direct support to members of the trans community in the form of financial assistance, food assistance and even help paying bills. "We try to provide support funds in general since trans people tend to be under resourced," Calabotta said. Intransitive maintains several support funds to assist transgender people in Arkansas, according to the intransitive.org website. Two funds assist with general support; the Arkansas Trans Support Fund and the Brayla Stone Microgrants program. Both funds provide assistance with rent, utilities, groceries, temporary emergency housing, medical expenses and transportation. Named for a 17-year-old Black transgender teen from North Little Rock who was murdered in Sherwood in June 2020, the Brayla Stone Microgrant program provides funds for Black transgender women and girls. Intransitive also has funds set up to provide gender affirming gear to trans youths, to assist incarcerated transgender people, and to help undocumented transgender immigrants who don't qualify for other types of financial assistance. Information on Intransitive and the programs it offers may be found online at this link. Catie Hartling, the president of PFLAG NWA, said the LGBTQ advocacy group has a three-pronged mission; to support members of the LGBTQ community, to advocate for LGBTQ rights, and to educate the community at large. PFLAG, which bills itself as "the nation's first and largest" LGBTQ advocacy group, was founded in 1973 and has had a chapter in Northwest Arkansas since the early 1990s. "We run support groups for anybody in the community so they're open to at-large," Hartling said. "For trans adults we run a trans-specific support group that's run by trans folks for trans folks, so as kids get older they can join that support group ... We also run a trans meet-up for trans and queer youth in Northwest Arkansas." Hartling said for security reasons PFLAG does not publicize details of its meetings but those interested may go to the group's website at this link for more information or to sign up to be notified of meetings. "We do that just to help keep people safe," Hartling said. "We don't want anything to happen or to have any bad actors visiting. We want to keep these kids safe and we encourage families to come with their kids to that." Hartling said PFLAG also presents educational programs on request from businesses or civic organizations and also keeps a list of LGBTQ affirming faith-based organizations as a resource. "Unfortunately, when a person comes out, sometimes their faith congregation isn't affirming and they can lose a big part of their lives but their faith is still really important to them," she said. "It's important to them to be able to find communities where they can practice their faith and feel like part of a faith community while also affirming and loving their family." Hartling said PFLAG, which is run and staffed by volunteers, has limited funds for direct assistance but the organization keeps a list of resources and entities that offer assistance. "If we have the capacity to help someone, depending on what they need, we'll help them but we don't always have the capacity," she said. "But folks can always reach out and we'll do what we can or get them to someone who can help them." Gwen Herzig, a Little Rock pharmacist and owner of Park West Pharmacy, is a vocal critic of the legislation making it more difficult for transgender people to find gender-affirming care or penalizing them or others over use of restrooms or preferred names and pronouns. Herzig, a transgender woman, said she understands and has experienced some of the difficulties facing transgender patients in finding care and to help with that, she maintains lists of LGBTQ affirming providers and resources at this link. When Herzig made the decision to transition, she said, reliable information about the process was difficult to come by. "It just was not clear, and I'm a health care professional," she said. "I'm someone who's supposed to be able to navigate the health care industry a little bit faster and easier, and to me it was the most horribly complex and convoluted thing ever." Herzig gained international notoriety last February following an exchange during a legislative committee hearing for Senate Bill 199 in which Sen. Matt McKee, R-Pearcy, asked her a question about her genitalia. A video of the exchange was widely shared and news reports appeared all over the world. Herzig said the resulting furor died down after a while but for a time her pharmacy and her employees were subjected to a stream of harassing and threatening phone calls and communications. "That hit TikTok, Twitter and everything else so it was like I was getting hit from everywhere, not just the United States," she said. "We get the occasional call, but that was a very unique situation." Braelyn Smith, a 26-year-old transgender man living in Central Arkansas, said because he didn't begin to transition until after he reached adulthood, the 2021 health care ban for minors didn't directly affect him but this year has felt different. "It's been really heartbreaking and demoralizing ... to watch these bills, to hear the rhetoric, and then this year we've got nine anti-transgender bills moving through the Legislature," Smith said. "They haven't all passed yet but none have been defeated either." Watching the committee hearings and tracking the bills as they have progressed, Smith said, has been "scary." "I'm used to people not understanding," he said. "I'm even used to people being hateful, but it's different when my rights are being threatened, when I'm not so cautious of individuals but I'm afraid of the government. It's a very different feeling." Smith said he knows people who have left Arkansas and has considered leaving, himself, but he said for now he has chosen to stay. "We're actively doing things to fight the legislation and to raise awareness," he said. "We're fighting."

         HOT SPRINGS -- Thirty-three of the 354 inmates in the Garland County jail Wednesday were waiting to be transferred to the Arkansas Department of Corrections, according to information the county provided in response to a records request. Some have been waiting since early December. They were part of the more than 2,300 state inmates on Wednesday's county jail backup list. Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin says that's too many taking beds that could be used for misdemeanor offenders. "Your county jails are worthless for the stated purpose of dealing with misdemeanor justice when they are filled with felons who belong in prison," he told Hot Springs National Park Rotary Club Wednesday. "There is no such thing as misdemeanor justice in Arkansas for the most part," Griffin said. "It's been removed from the criminal code, because people know they can drag race. They can do whatever they want and they're not going to jail because the jails are already full with felons that belong in a prison that we never built." Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders recently announced plans for 3,000 more prison beds, an expansion Griffin said was long overdue. A lack of political will has contributed to the number of state inmates in county jails, he said. "If you don't like building prisons, when you wake up from your land of rainbows, unicorns and glitter and enter the real world, I'll talk to you," Griffin told the Rotarians. "The reason we have a big bill for prisons is for 20 years nothing has been done," he said. "Where do you think the prisoners have been going? They've been filling up your county jails. You've expanded prisons the wrong way, out of the public eye and without a set appropriation dedicated to new beds." Griffin said a project he commissioned as lieutenant governor showed parole violators were responsible for a large percentage of violent crime. Many were paroled after serving a fraction of their sentence in confinement. Twenty of the inmates on Garland County's backup list had an intake status of returned from ADC or Arkansas Community Correction release, a designation the ADC has said is generally used for parole violators. According to emails from previous records requests, Garland County jail officials said holding parole violators led to intake restrictions that required inmates to be released before new ones could be booked during parts of 2019. They blamed the Criminal Justice Efficiency and Safety Act. The 2017 law allows the state parole and probation agency to punish technical parole violations, such as failed drug screens or missed meetings with parole officers, with up to a 180-day term in a state facility. But most violators serve their sanctions in county jails. "I got to my position on this stuff with data, hard facts," Griffin said. "If you took away all the parolees committing violent crime, our crime rate would be consistent with what you would normally expect. ... The bottom line is your eligibility date for parole, that's your sentence date in Arkansas. The judges and lawyers all know it." Griffin said the Protect Arkansas Act working its way through the Legislature will keep offenders locked up for a larger percentage of their sentence. The most violent offenses are parole eligible after the offender has served 70% of their sentence in confinement. The Protect Arkansas Act makes many violent offenses ineligible for early release. "People say we lock up more people than anybody, but we push them right out with just a fraction of their sentence," Griffin said. " ... It's interesting to me that we want truth in everything, but some people don't want truth in sentencing. Because the deception in sentencing serves their purposes. "Even if this is not even implemented well, it will be a million times better than the nightmare we have now. It's a clown show. You think you can attract jobs to this state with lawlessness, you're kidding yourselves." Griffin said limiting parole eligibility would make state and local enforcement less reliant on the federal criminal code. They refer many cases to U.S. attorneys because there's no parole in the federal prison system. "Instead of running to the feds every time we have a problem, because our system is so bad, fix your own system," Griffin said. "Criminals are not scared of the state system, because they know they'll be out soon. Criminals are scared to death of the federal system. These are not debatable opinions. These are facts."

         BENTONVILLE -- The Street Department recently overlaid two city streets as part of a new, in-house program, an official said. Crews worked on Southwest Aviation Drive and Southeast Clark Street last week, said Dennis Birge, city transportation director. Southwest Aviation Drive is east of the Municipal Airport/Thaden Field. Southeast Clark connects to Southeast 18th Street to the south and to Southeast S Street to the northeast. Overlay includes milling out 1.5 inches of pavement, then replacing it with new pavement, Birge said. The goal is to do 10 miles of asphalt overlay this year, with 2 miles done by the Street Department. The number of miles the city could finish might go as high as four as the year moves along, Birge said. The city will contract the rest of the overlay work as it has done in previous years. The city has a $1 million budget this year for overlay and pavement preservation, Birge said. The goal is to spend about 20% of that on the in-house paving operation, he said. An in-house paving operation is important to stretch budgeted money, he said. "We are still looking to keep the majority of our budget toward the contracted-out work for pavement preservation and mill/overlay work," he said. "Our goal is to provide the citizens with maintenance that will extend the life of our existing roadways as well as make strategic improvements that will keep us in close range of the need we see from our current growth. That is a challenge at the current growth rate, so I don't see us getting away from the contractor overlay work for the foreseeable future." The initial setup cost for an in-house paving program was about $1.3 million for a paver, milling machine, tractor trailer to haul the paver and a roller, Birge said. It will take about 9 1/2 miles of work to recoup the investment, Birge said. Bigger projects like street cuts also are contracted out because the city is growing and there are so many of them, Birge said. Street cuts are typically created by development or utility work that causes a need for utility connections under the pavement. The cuts are patched with a temporary mix until the Street Department can do a permanent repair. The Street Department contracts out these repairs every couple years to help get caught up, Birge said. The city hopes to overlay Sears Road between Mill Dam and Southwest Morning Star roads, in the extreme southwest part of town, this summer, Birge said. It is a road the city and Benton County maintain. Sears Road is within city limits from Morning Star Road to Heagerty Road, a half-mile stretch; the county maintains the road from Heagerty to Mill Dam. Jay Frasier, county administrator of public services, said discussion was in the preliminary stage. "It is possible that we may be able to partner with the county to pave the next 0.5 miles, but I can only confidently state that we will pave the section within city of Bentonville limits at this time," Birge said. The county does its overlay and the filling of potholes in-house, but contracts out chip-and-seal work, Frasier said. The county Road Department spent the past week working on dirt roads that were topped by rain March 24. At one point there were 19 road closures, all but three of which were in the northwest part of the county. A culvert was blown out at the intersection of Fruitwood and Stagecoach roads, according to the county. High water removed material like red dirt and base from the top of the pipe and cut a void into it, Frasier said. The cleanup will take about five weeks, with grader work the last step, he said. The county's Road Department plans to work on 35 miles of road -- overlay, chip-and-seal and state aid projects -- this year at a projected cost of $1.77 million.

         SILOAM SPRINGS -- The First Lego League community in Siloam Springs continues to get better, and this year is no different. The team will be attending the Arkansas Razorback Open Invitational, which is an international tournament set for May 18-21. The team from Siloam Springs will be representing the state of Arkansas. First Lego League is an organization in which students learn coding and robotics from constructing and competing with Lego robots. The competitions feature students maneuvering Lego robots through obstacles and challenges, as well as an innovation challenge meant to spark new ideas. "We're at the middle school level, which is ages 9 to 14. Each year is a different theme; this year the theme is energy generation and production," said Jeremy Weathers, one of the team's coaches. Weathers said the league helps inspire critical and creative thinking and helps with building problem solving skills. The team attended multiple competitions throughout the fall semester, including a qualifying tournament in December where it ranked second out of 19 teams from Arkansas. The team went on to state, where it performed well enough to get invited to the Arkansas Razorback Open Invitational, which draws in 80 teams, many of which are international. In addition to one team per state, the competition will feature teams from Spain, Japan, Italy and other countries from around the globe. "This is one of the top-run tournaments at this level, and it's pretty cool," Weathers said. While they have a passion for teaching kids about robotics, both coaches noted that they had day jobs outside that. Weathers is a software developer, and fellow coach Dave Ellcey works in marketing. "We don't have a goal of necessarily winning this competition; this is going to be my first time taking a team to this level. The kids made a goal to get a call back from the judges, meaning they performed well enough on the first round of the competition to be in the top 20," Weathers said. "It's a bit of an audacious goal for their level, but we've seen a pattern every year where we are improving, so it's definitely within the realm of possibility," he said. Weathers said between now and the competition, the team's goal is to practice, have fun and raise money for future endeavors. Weathers said, more than anything, he wants the kids to learn and have fun. "I try to step back and let them do all the work themselves," he said. "If they have questions, I'd be happy to answer them, but I like letting them learn from trial and error."

         WYNNE -- School officials in storm-ravaged Wynne are hoping to get students back to class in one week's time after Friday's confirmed EF3 tornado tore through the city, destroying its high school and other community fixtures. Wynne School District Superintendent Kenneth Moore said officials are looking at ways to resume classes by April 10, including assessing the district's intermediate school to see if part of it can be salvaged for grades to combine and learning to resume. Moore said he met with Arkansas Secretary of Education Jacob Oliva for three hours Saturday to get a plan together, and his administrative team met again Sunday morning. "We know that in a time like this, when we get back to normal as quick as possible, it really helps our students," Moore said. "We are going to have additional counselors available, because we know that even if we have a thunderstorm -- there's trauma that our kids have gone through -- our staff have gone through -- and so we want to make sure we've got that extra level of support for them." He said the district also is trying to determine how many families have access to Wi-Fi and laptops for possible remote learning, and Oliva is looking at ways to get additional devices to students. On Sunday, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders joined Oliva and Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Deanne Criswell to survey the wreckage of Wynne High School with Moore and Wynne Mayor Jennifer Hobbs. After touring the campus, Oliva said the damage equated to "hands down" the worst "impacted storm events" he has seen on a school campus. "We're very grateful to the district and their leadership to make sure that throughout this event students are safe," he added. "We are going to be here on site every single day so we can stand arm [in] arm and hand in hand and one day welcome our students back into our classrooms." Sanders agreed: It was an "unbelievably tragic moment." The governor noted that Moore brought her to a spot inside the remains of the school, where all the walls had caved in except for two. On one was a mural of Wynne and on the other was a message: "Once a yellow jacket, always a yellow jacket." "I think those two things really symbolize what this community is -- could not be more proud than to be governor of Arkansas because of what communities like this and all across our state represent," Sanders said. "People coming together, standing up, knowing that no matter what challenges we face, nothing is going to destroy us. Nothing is going to bring us down. "If anything we will come back better and stronger," she said. "That doesn't mean it's an easy road. We have a long road. But I can assure you that the people behind me are up to the task." The governor commended state Sen. Ronald Caldwell, state Rep. Steve Hollowell, and school and city leadership for their efforts after the tornado struck. "I've been very clear that our perspective is that people are going to come first and the paperwork will come second," Sanders said. "Whatever it takes to bring aid and resources and assistance to the people of Arkansas. That's what we're gonna deliver." She also thanked Criswell and FEMA for delivering resources to meet victims' needs. Another effort Sanders recognized was that of Wynne students who found an American flag and a Wynne High School flag to fly outside the destroyed campus. "I think that should make all of us very proud, not just as a community, but as the next generation coming behind us," she said. "And the people that we know will be running this town once it's rebuilt. I have every confidence that Wynne is going to come back better, bigger and stronger. I can't tell you how proud I am to be here today and stand with this community." Criswell addressed concerns about more storms and tornadoes predicted to hit the region Tuesday. She said debris removal underway will aid in preventing more destruction, and the governor's approved request for a presidential disaster declaration will help reimburse those costs. "What I want people to do; what they need to know right now is that they need to listen to what the weather forecasts are," she emphasized. "They need to know how they're going to get their alerts and how they're going to get that emergency warning, know where they're gonna go. I think we've heard great stories of survival, and we want to make sure that we continue to hear those stories, so having people really pay attention and know what they're gonna do to protect themselves and their family is the most important." Had technology not delivered on time and given proper warnings, "we'd be looking at a very different situation," Sanders said. "Thankfully we're not," she said. "I'm hopeful ... people will continue to follow the alerts. Pay attention to the notices and the weather alerts that are coming and listen to your city and local officials that are giving you guidance on where you can go, where you can be safely and not to take these things for granted." Sanders also applauded volunteers who came from other cities, hours away, to help in the aftermath. "The level of people and volunteers that we have seen is frankly staggering," Sanders said. "It's one of the reasons I'm so proud to be governor of Arkansas is because our people are so good. It is by far the greatest asset, the state of Arkansas has is the goodness of the people here and we have seen that in droves." Sanders closed her remarks by reassuring the public that FEMA's partnership with the state is "extremely important" for the long haul of recuperation efforts. Criswell said schools are the hearts of communities, "and we want to make sure that we get the Yellowjackets back here, right, that we have them back in their school because that's where the heart of the community is." "As we look to the long-term recovery, we're going to partner with the governor," she added. We are here for the long haul, governor, we are going to be with you through this process. We know that this journey is going to be long, but the programs that we have to help support the rebuilding of this community is what comes with this presidential disaster declaration."

         BELLA VISTA -- Members of the Bella Vista Arts Council say they are excited to unveil two new murals on the exterior of the Bella Vista Public Library that were designed to integrate with the garden areas surrounding the building. The unveiling event is set for 3:30 p.m. Wednesday at the Bella Vista Public Library located at 11 Dickens Place. In October 2022, board members sought regional muralists to submit designs focusing on nature themes and a spring color palette of bright rich colors. Bella Vista resident Graham Edwards was selected for two projects. Edwards has created many murals throughout Northwest Arkansas. At the Bella Vista Public Library, the "Voice of the Garden" mural is installed on the west-facing wall as people enter the garden area on the right side of the building. The "Flying Jewel" hummingbird mural is located on the north side of the building and to the left of the front entrance. "Voice of the Garden" and "Flying Jewel" are two murals that showcase two important workers of The Natural State, a bee and a hummingbird, Edwards said. With the magnitude of attractions to see in Arkansas, it can be easy to forget the smallest among us who make this region so beautiful, he said. "The bee is perched upon the Arkansas state flower, an apple blossom, pollinating the surrounding flowers to ensure their growth for the season. The hummingbird is one of the most unique birds Arkansas is able to accommodate and in the mural is seen hovering and gathering nectar from a honeysuckle," he said. "They, too, are pollinators, ensuring a diverse ecosystem for other animals to live on, though they themselves like to be left alone. However, when a group of hummingbirds are together it is called a charm. Their speed and agility are unlike other birds, flying backward and upside down making them a spectacle in any garden they inhabit," he said. In addition to these two new works of art, library patrons and visitors can enjoy four more public art installations outside the building, also commissioned by members of the Arts Council, including the six "FireFlys" installation by Tom Flynn that light up at dusk; "Mantis" by Alex Cogbill and Paul Siebenthal, a 3D sculpture in the plaza garden area; and "Wheels in Motion" by Stevie Stevens, a 2D mosaic sculpture along the parking area entry. Don't miss the mural inside the library as well, painted in the children's area by local artist Paige Dirksen.

         The history of the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff -- and, by extension, a significant portion of the modern history of the Pine Bluff community -- will now be more readily accessible due to the launch of the University Museum and Cultural Center's collections and archive search portal. The portal will be a valuable resource for students, faculty, researchers and the public to explore the storied and unique culture and heritage of Pine Bluff and the surrounding area, according to UAPB. The user-friendly online platform provides access to digitized items that capture college life dating back to 1873, when the university was founded. "[You] can conduct research at any time from any location," rather than having to physically visit the museum, said Stephanie Sims, the museum's director. People can "bring their history home with them." Items will continue to be added -- UAPB homecoming and commencement programs beginning in 1891 are already visible -- and individuals can explore the collection online at https://bit.ly/3TXgfyz, according to the university. The collection is a window into not only UAPB, but also the city of Pine Bluff, the Arkansas Delta, and Black history and culture. "There's more to come, [as] this is an ongoing process," Sims said. "I see a lot more growth and visibility." For example, the portal will continue to add yearbooks, which are very popular, she said. "Lots of alumni have reached out, and we pay attention." UAPB -- the oldest and largest of Arkansas' historically Black colleges and universities -- has an active and proud alumni base, which Sims knows firsthand, as she, too, is a graduate of the university. Creating this online portal is one way to demonstrate "we listen to our alumni and hear them," she said. "People are nostalgic," and for many university alumni, revisiting materials from their time on campus is a way to "relive a time they enjoyed most." The museum and culture center's activities are paid for in total or in part by funding from the U.S. Department of Education, Office of Postsecondary Education, Institutional Services Program, Title III Part B, and the Historically Black Colleges and Universities program. "This portal is an important part of preserving and promoting the 150-year history and culture of UAPB, Arkansas AM&N, and Branch Normal College," Chancellor Laurence Alexander said in a news release from the university. "By making our collections accessible to the public, we hope to inspire a greater understanding and appreciation of our shared heritage." In addition to the new online search portal, the museum and cultural center maintains normal business hours Monday-Friday for those who do want to visit in person, and appointments can be scheduled, Sims said. "We're also happy to work with anyone conducting research -- just [contact] us" at (870) 575-8234 or museum@uapb.edu. Preserving the history of the university and the Black community in the Arkansas Delta has been a mission of the museum and cultural center since it started in 2004, and the online search portal is a major advance toward that aim, Sims said. "[We want] to share that narrative," not only with "those who lived it" or heard about it from friends and/or family, but also with future generations who want to know about their history. And no one should think Sims and others at the museum and cultural center or university are going to rest in their archiving efforts, she said. "History continues to be made, so we can't stop."

         The Bentonville Street Department recently overlaid two city streets as part of a new in-house program, an official said. Crews worked on Southwest Aviation Drive and Southeast Clark Street last week, said Dennis Birge, city transportation director. Southwest Aviation Drive is east of the Municipal Airport/Thaden Field. Southeast Clark connects to Southeast 18th Street to the south and to Southeast S Street to the northeast. Overlay includes milling out 1.5 inches of pavement, then replacing it with new pavement, Birge said. The goal is to do 10 miles of asphalt overlay this year, with 2 miles done by the Street Department. The number of miles the city could finish might go as high as four as the year moves along, Birge said. The city will contract out the rest of the overlay work as it has done in previous years.    The city has a $1 million budget this year for overlay and pavement preservation, Birge said. The goal is to spend about 20% of that on the in-house paving operation, he said. An in-house paving operation is important to stretch budgeted money, he said. "We are still looking to keep the majority of our budget toward the contracted-out work for pavement preservation and mill/overlay work," he said. "Our goal is to provide the citizens with maintenance that will extend the life of our existing roadways as well as make strategic improvements that will keep us in close range of the need we see from our current growth. That is a challenge at the current growth rate, so I don't see us getting away from the contractor overlay work for the foreseeable future." The initial setup cost for an in-house paving program was about $1.3 million for a paver, milling machine, tractor-trailer to haul the paver and a roller, Birge said. It will take about 9½ miles of work to recoup the investment, Birge said.  Print Headline: Bentonville begins in-house overlay program for streets Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

            <h2>Hot Springs, Garland County weigh 911 operation consolidation</h2>

         The city of Hot Springs and Garland County submitted a plan to combine their 911 operations, but City Manager Bill Burrough said that doesn't mean they are committed to consolidation. The city would move to the county's 911 Communications Center, in the booking area of the old county jail on Ouachita Avenue. It has five fully equipped dispatch consoles, with the capacity to add another five, County Judge Darryl Mahoney said. The city and county are projected to receive $1.4 million in public safety surcharge fees this year. Collected and remitted by wireless providers, the fees support 911 operations at the roughly 100 public safety answering points statewide. As part of the statewide consolidation mandated by 2019 legislation, the state 911 Board has said funding from the surcharge would be limited to one of the two public safety answering points in Garland County. Submitting a consolidation plan ensured funding for both facilities would continue through the end of next year. The city receives about $500,000 a year, and the county gets close to $1 million. Neither is sufficient to fully fund either PSAP, as the city and county general funds subsidize both facilities. The county 911 fund's projected 2023 revenue included a $960,000 general fund transfer. "We haven't made the decision we're going to consolidate," Burrough said Friday. "I don't think that's in the best interest of the citizens and residents we serve or the community. The decision that will have to be made is whether we lose our funding, or whether we consolidate. "We're not saying we're opposed to the consolidation. We just don't think it's in the best interest long term from redundancies standpoints and other things." The city and county appealed the 911 Board's consolidation decision last fall but were denied. The plan they submitted in December showed a combined annual wireless 911 call volume of 90,000, a number they said warranted funding for two PSAPs. "Any given day we could have 250,000 people here," Burrough, referring to the area's tourism economy, said. "We're not just a city of 38,000." The city said it spent $624,224 upgrading its PSAP inside the Hot Springs Police Department. The $3.54 million raised by the temporary property tax the Hot Springs Board of Directors levied in the 2016 and 2017 tax years paid for the upgrade. Consultants the city hired recommended it expand its PSAP. But the same consultants, Federal Engineering of Virginia, recommended the city and county consolidate 911 operations in its 2021 report to the 911 Board. The city stopped paying Federal Engineering and has talked about trying to recoup money that's already been paid on the $415,062 contract the Hot Springs Board of Directors awarded in 2017 to advise the city on its more than $6 million communications upgrade. "We do have a lot invested in building out our dispatch center," Burrough said. "We had Federal Engineering moving us into that direction, and on the other hand, they're moving the state into consolidation. So we don't feel like the left hand knew what the right hand was doing from that standpoint. That's something I'm not pleased with." The plan called for combining equipment from both facilities. "We're not going to lose all of our investment in the dispatch center if we move it," Burrough said. "The largest cost is the stations, and those could be moved to the dispatch center on Ouachita. "We need more room in our police department. We would welcome the additional space to be able to move some of our other portions of the department into that area." Under the plan, a consolidated PSAP would be under the county judge's authority. It would operate according to policies and procedures decided by a board comprising the sheriff, city police and fire chiefs, a rotating chief representing volunteer fire protection districts, LifeNet, the county judge and city manager. The current dispatching staff at both facilities would be offered jobs. A unified call center would employ eight to 12 call takers and about two dozen dispatchers working in shifts of six to seven. "We still have a lot of things we need to make decisions on," Burrough said. "We're working together. It's not an adversarial issue between the city and the county. We're going to work for what's best for the community, not just the city or the county." That kind of collaboration wasn't at the fore of earlier city-county discussions about 911 operations. They invested in PSAP upgrades as the state was warning that many jurisdictions could lose funding. It was the dominant topic at the 2018 Arkansas Emergency Management Conference at the Hot Springs Convention Center. The state said the cost of operating more than 100 PSAPs exceeded 911 revenue from wireless providers by $20 million annually. Consolidation was seen as a way to narrow the gap, leading to the 2019 law that resulted in the 911 Board's decision to limit state funding to one PSAP in Garland County. The city and county resisted consolidation. They cited the incompatibility of their computer-aided dispatch systems as an impediment to a unified call center. The consolidation plan they submitted in December noted the differences in the two systems.

         Editor's note: The Arkansas Department of Health is changing how it labels violations. During this process, both newer and older terms may appear. Violations marked as priority contribute directly to the elimination, prevention or reduction in the hazards associated with foodborne illness. Priority violations include prevention of contamination, cooking, reheating, cooling and handwashing. Priority foundation rules support, facilitate, or enable one or more priority items. Core violations include items that usually relate to general sanitation, operational controls, equipment design or general maintenance. Critical violations are those factors leading to foodborne illness and must be corrected immediately. Noncritical violations relate to maintenance of food operations and cleanliness.

         Editor's Note: This is the second in a five-part series on the proposed Springdale bond issue. SPRINGDALE -- The city is asking voters to approve a bond issue that could mean $135 million for work on streets and intersections. Residents will vote May 9 whether to fund street and other city improvements by extending a 1% sales tax to support a bond issue. Early voting starts May 2. Colby Fulfer, the mayor's chief of staff, noted how important good roads are for a city. He pointed out the Walmart Supercenter on Elm Springs Road was built shortly after the overpass was improved. Mayor Doug Sprouse noted the construction of Gene George Boulevard provided access for Arkansas Children's Northwest, Sam's Club and a Chick-fil-A restaurant. Dixieland Road and Kendrick Avenue are under construction to build infrastructure for industry, Sprouse said. "When they built the Don Tyson Parkway, I knew it was a game changer," said Bill Rogers, president of the Springdale Chamber of Commerce. "It was a different vision to see how to get to the middle of town." Rogers recalled cutting through Johnson and neighborhood streets -- anything to avoid the then-crowded Sunset Avenue, he said. Sunset was the only major thoroughfare east to west through the middle of the city before Don Tyson Parkway. The parkway opened in 2009, and its interchange at Interstate 49 in 2016. Rogers said he can't understate the impact of what the city has done with road work in the past 15 years. "The improvements are why the city enjoys the economic prosperity it has today," he concluded. Big ideas The city has several road projects at the top of its 2023 bond to-do list, Sprouse said. City leaders want to finish the extension and connection of West Emma and Har-Ber avenues, which it started with 2018 bond money. The project was to include an overpass over Interstate 49, but was put on hold because of labor and material shortages and inflation, Sprouse said. Other projects on the list include extending Gene George Boulevard north to County Line Road and then County Line to the Shaw Family Park and improving 64th Street south to Don Tyson Parkway. The city already has contracted with engineering firms for design of these projects, started utility relocation and obtained rights of way, so construction can begin soon after the bond money is deposited with the city, if voters approve, Sprouse said. "The projects are shovel-ready," he said. The City Council on Tuesday approved a contract of $258,600 with O.R. Colan Associates to obtain rights of way for extending Don Tyson Parkway west to Arkansas 112 and Gene George south to Reed Valley Road. The city, with money from previous bonds, concentrated on building traffic ways, wider roads with fewer traffic lights that were designed to move drivers across the city quickly, Sprouse said. The extension of Har-Ber Avenue and the bridge over the interstate is designed to divert traffic from both the Sunset intersection and the Elm Springs Road intersection with the interstate, Sprouse said. More than 100,000 cars a day pass through each intersection, according to traffic counts by the Arkansas Department of Transportation. Little help Much of the money from the 2023 bond program would be spent to improve existing intersections, Sprouse said. Fulfer explained little modifications can make a big difference -- like adding designated turn lanes at some intersections and reprogramming the timing of traffic lights. The city commissioned the local office of Garver USA engineering firm to conduct a traffic study and recommend road improvements. The study examined 64 intersections with light signals, grading each on safety, congestion and traffic volume. The study also provides improvement recommendations and cost estimates. The study does not rank the improvements in any order of importance, it notes. City Council members will decide which of the projects to undertake with 2023 bond money, if approved. Recommended improvements to existing roads would cost $142.9 million, according to the study. Recommended new road construction would cost an estimated $99.2 million, the study says. Work to improve safety and traffic flow at intersections would cost an estimated $18.3 million. The study also identified another $2.3 million for projects to make streets safer for pedestrians and bike riders. Suggested improvements to North 56th Street alone would cost $28.2 million, the study projects. Those improvements would run along 2.3 miles of the street from Elm Springs Road to Shaw Family Park. The proposal, if followed, would put a new roundabout at the street's intersection with West County Line Road and include a four-lane section with a raised center median. "The project will extend the vital north-south 56th Street-Gene George Boulevard corridor and provide safe pedestrian access to Shaw Park," the study says. The next most expensive proposal in the study is a $21 million improvement to and some rerouting of South Gene George Boulevard "from approximately 2,000-foot north of New Hope Road and continuing south to Johnson Mill Boulevard," the study says. Improvements would include a four-lane roadway section with a raised center median. These changes would allow extending New Hope Road east to intersect with South Gene George Boulevard, with a new roundabout at their intersection. The intersections of North 40th Street and Elm Springs Road and Don Tyson Parkway and South Thompson Street are both listed in the report, Fulfer said. It also listed upgrades for older streets, like McRay Avenue to 40th Street, he said. Sprouse said improving existing intersections will be important as the city works to increase the density of development in the downtown district. "The city still has a lot of undeveloped land or land for redevelopment," he said. "The city is working to increase density in the city core. I want to make sure the infrastructure like street signals and turn lanes can be there before build out." The Garver study also considered routes for alternative forms of transportation. For example, the wide traffic lanes on Don Tyson Parkway could be narrowed to allow for a painted bike path, Fulfer said. Good problem Floyd Watson spends roughly eight hours a day driving the city streets. He estimated 60 to 70 miles a day driving bus routes for the Springdale School District. Watson described himself as a positive person. Rather than complain about sitting in a line of traffic trying to cross Interstate 49, he praised the work the city already has done. "I don't know what we'd do if we didn't have this tax base," Watson said. "We wouldn't be able to get around. If you consider, that in the next three decades the population is going to more than double ... what kind of infrastructure are we needing to have to keep up? We've got to keep doing things." The School District runs 89 routes, including transportation for students with special needs, said Kevin Conkin, the district's director of transportation. Before the covid-19 pandemic closed schools, the district's buses recorded 1.3 million to 1.4 million miles a year, Conkin said. He stated the mileage has not been reassessed. "Growth is a wonderful problem to have," he said. "We might get frustrated by work on the community roadways, but you know it will be good in the end."  None  Special election Springdale residents will vote on a $360 million bond issue May 9. The ballot contains six questions. Estimated costs and projects are: $135 million for street improvements. $16.3 million for park improvements. $16.3 million for a new Senior Center. $7.8 million for a new fire station and other improvements. $142 million to refinance debt on the 2018 bonds. $44 million to refinance the 2020 bonds.

         BENTONVILLE -- A jury will consider the revocation of USA Metal Recycling's conditional use permit by Lowell. The trial in Benton County Circuit Court is set to begin Dec. 3, 2024, according to a Feb. 28 order signed by Judge Xollie Duncan. USA Metal Recycling was ordered to cease operations six months ago when the Lowell Planning Commission revoked the company's permit on Oct. 3. The City Council affirmed the revocation Dec. 20 after determining the business hadn't resolved safety issues at its site, like the creation of fire lanes meeting legal standards. The business filed a notice of appeal concerning the city's decision on Jan. 18. According to state law, certain decisions by municipal bodies can be appealed to county circuit court. USA Metal's notice of appeal requested a trial by jury and did not outline an argument against the permit revocation. The city maintains the decision was "lawful and legitimate," according to a response from the city and its attorney, Tom Kieklak, filed Feb. 17. Councilman Eric Schein asked Tom Smith of USA Metal at the Dec. 20 meeting why he would appeal the permit revocation rather than apply for a new permit, which he said may be faster and simpler. The process of approving a conditional use permit can take less than a month, according to Karen Davis, the city's community development director. Smith said his business shouldn't have been shut down and he wanted the city to reverse its decision. "A barrage of misinformation" led to a rushed decision by the commission, he told the council Dec. 20. "At this point, I've got nothing to lose," Smith said at the Dec. 20 meeting. "I'm out of money and out of business. If you put someone in a corner like that, it's a bad place to be." The business has disagreed with representatives of the city about what the conditional use permit did and did not allow. The permit granted to the business at 721 S. Lincoln St. allowed recycling of metal, but not other materials, which were documented at the scene of a fire last year, according to Davis. The business presented itself as a metal recycling facility, according to an Aug. 5 cease-and-desist letter from Davis to Smith. According to Smith, there were no conditions on the conditional use permit received in 2009, deadlines given by the commission last year were "virtually impossible" for the business to meet and city staff refused his attempts at communication throughout the process. The name of the business implies it only recycles metal, though its plan has been to also recycle byproducts such as cardboard boxes and shrink wrap, he said. Mayor Chris Moore said in December city staff hadn't been ignoring Smith. The Aug. 2 fire was in material dumped on a lot just north of the 721 S. Lincoln St. address, according to Davis. That lot is part of USA Metal's permit, she said. Material intended to be recycled through USA Metal was also found on a third northernmost lot, which isn't part of the company's permit or associated with any business license, she said. The site was being used to dump debris from Smith's construction company, Redline Contractors, according to a Sept. 8 letter from Davis to the Planning Commission. Debris blocked fire crews' access to the fire Aug. 2, according to a Fire Department report. Crews were forced to access the fire through the north lot because fire lanes were blocked in the south and middle lots, according to Davis. Firefighters reported arriving at the site of the fire at 5:31 p.m. and leaving just after midnight. The city ordered USA Metal to halt operations Aug. 5, stating that records from the Arkansas Department of Energy and Environment showed the business recorded construction material at 721 S. Lincoln St. and reported a "change of business" to a construction demolition recycling facility in 2016. The business' conditional use permit never allowed material such as construction debris at the site, according to the cease-and-desist letter from the city. USA Metal continued operating after the cease and desist, Davis said. On Aug. 10, the Planning Commission ordered the business to follow the conditional use permit, clean up construction and demolition debris at the site within a week and comply with state regulations to remediate the water in the pond. The commission voted Sept. 8 to recommend extending the conditional use permit with conditions through Oct. 3, giving the business a list of required actions. Before the commission's decision to revoke the permit Oct. 3, city Special Services Director Richard Stone said USA Metal had moved all its equipment and debris onto its own property and communicated with the Stormwater Management Department, but hadn't shown completion of any of the other tasks.

         Editor's note: The Arkansas Department of Health is changing how it labels violations. During this process, both newer and older terms may appear. Violations marked as priority contribute directly to the elimination, prevention or reduction in the hazards associated with foodborne illness. Priority violations include prevention of contamination, cooking, reheating, cooling and handwashing. Priority foundation rules support, facilitate or enable, one or more priority items. Core violations include items that usually relate to general sanitation, operational controls, equipment design or general maintenance. Critical violations are those factors leading to foodborne illness and must be corrected immediately. Noncritical violations relate to maintenance of food operations and cleanliness.

        If Saturday was a day to measure the breadth of the damage wrought by an EF-3 tornado on Friday afternoon, then Sunday was a day to gauge the depth of the recovery required. Organizations offering food, shelter and supplies in Little Rock, North Little Rock and other affected communities did brisk business Sunday — both from people needing and people donating — while local officials began the work of deciding how to proceed. "We're on day three of many, many days ahead of us," said North Little Rock Police Chief Mike Davis. Also Sunday, the National Weather Service offices in North Little Rock and Memphis continued to survey the storm's damage and uncover other areas where the tornado hit, all while keeping their eyes on another storm front expected to hit the state by Tuesday. Colby Pope, a meteorologist with the service's North Little Rock office, said all hazards — high winds, large hail and strong tornadoes — are possible with the system. “Id say thats going to be a possibility for whole state,” Pope said. “Right now, thats what Im looking at here.” Donation centers buzzing Volunteers with North Little Rocks First Assembly stood outside one wing of the building Sunday afternoon passing out tarps, food, water, cleaning supplies, toys for kids and more. “Were the designated spot for drop-offs in the city of NLR,” one volunteer said. “About every other car is a drop-off and about every other car is a pick-up. Weve gone through two 18-wheeler trucks of food and supplies in the last 24 hours. Were not asking for any information. If youre asking for it, were giving it.” According to another volunteer with the church, donations from community members had wrapped around the building by Saturday afternoon. A truck from Amazons disaster relief was scheduled to drop off a new load of supplies Sunday evening. “The biggest need right now is tarps, boxes and containers for people to put their stuff in,” the volunteer added. “Since were the city-designated we have 18-wheelers come and unload supplies here and then city services and trailers head out into communities like Levy because they cant get big trucks in.” The church — which is located at 4501 Burrow Drive, just west of U.S. 67/167 in North Little Rock, about 1 1/2 miles north of the Interstate 40 interchange — is operating from around 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. every day of the week. On Murray Street in Little Rock, members of the Little Rock Fire Academy are working alongside Goodwill to collect and distribute supplies to community members. Residents dropped off non-perishables, toiletries, water and more from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. Sunday. “Yesterday we transported about 70 palettes of goods,” Little Rocks Communications Director Aaron Sadler said. “I think weve had hundreds and hundreds of cars come through.” Beginning Monday, the city of Little Rock will open a Family Assistance Center at 315 N. Shackleford Roiad, Mayor Frank Scott Jr. said Sunday. The Family Assistance Center is a partnership with Engage Arkansas, Arkansas Baptist Disaster Relief, the Salvation Army, Wolfe Street Foundation, Center for Youth and Families, Immanuel Baptist Church, Goodwill Industries, and the United Way. “We are united in our commitment to serve those who were impacted by this storm as we move forward together to rebuild," Scott said. "Im humbled by the outpouring of support from not just this community, but from around the world. The center will provide water, food, and supplies, and people may also request volunteer chainsaw crews through the center who will assist residents with tree removal and tarp placement. FEMA representatives will be onsite for residents who need federal assistance. NLR schools off to assess damage, needs North Little Rock School District Superintendent Greg Pilewski said all schools will be closed for students on Monday, though staff and faculty are to report to their schools. The day will be used to further learn about facultys needs during this time, the plan for bus routes in impacted areas and ensuring that power is back to all of the schools. The districts tentative plan is to have students and staff back in school Tuesday, he said. “We think tomorrow is going to be a big transition day and were going to learn a lot,” Pilewski said. North Little Rock Mayor Terry Hartwick said North Little Rock has hired an Alabama company to help facilitate the cleanup. Crowdergulf LLC works with communities needing assistance with disaster recovery, debris removal and coastal restoration services. Sherwood Mayor Jo Heye-Townsell said her city will also contract with Crowdergulf to assist in clean-up efforts in their city. Davis said even with the contractor, the city will still need help during the upcoming weeks as everyone “goes back to work.” “If you havent done anything up until now, dont think ‘hey, its over, I dont have to worry about it now," he said. "We need more in the next few weeks.” Little Rock efforts At a Sunday morning press conference at the heavily damaged Colony West shopping center off North Rodney Parham Road, where the sound of chainsaws and heavy equipment nearly drowned out the speakers, Scott the city is working toward recovery. “Were going to try and get operations back to as smooth as possible,” Scott said. “Its going to probably take months for a lot of these residential communities, as well as our commercial activity, to get back to normal. Its our first priority to do all we can to rebuild and recover for the residents of Little Rock and Central Arkansas.” City staff and community members have spent the days following the Friday storm coming together to clear roadways, provide free meals to those in need and offering their services where they can, the mayor said.   Federal Emergency Management Agency representatives highlighted that their assistance can be used in many ways by those affected by the storm. Speakers with the federal organization reminded people that not every persons impact story will look the same or require the same assistance. Those seeking help from the agency will discuss what services are needed and will be directed to the necessary resources and help, they said. Pamela Smith, spokesperson for the Little Rock School District, said school will open districtwide as normal on Monday morning after assessments over the weekend determined that no school district property was damaged. Smith said there are some remaining problems with communications, particularly internet service, due to widespread damage to utility poles. “We have crews working to get that repaired because that impacts our communications district-wide,” Smith said. “We have different sites that feed into different schools in clusters and some of the lines are in the air and as a result of the storm damage, it caused a fiber issue at some of our sites.” Smith said over the weekend efforts were made to ensure that bus routes would be unimpeded. Power-packed storm The National Weather Service office in North Little Rock has confirmed that the EF-3 tornado, with winds reaching 165 miles per hour, cut a path of destruction through the metro area that stretched for 32 miles before the twister dissipated. Information on the weather service website said the tornado touched down at 2:22 p.m. and ran along a northwest track through Pulaski and Lonoke counties before it dissipated at 2:57 p.m. just south of Cabot cutting a 600 yard-wide path at its widest. Pope, the National Weather Service staff meteorologist, said on Sunday that surveyors have determined that the worst damage in central Arkansas was along a northeast track from the North Shackleford Road area into west Little Rock before the storm crossed the Arkansas River into North Little Rock. Pope said that surveyors are also investigating an area in Garland County near Pine Mountain where damage reports were received. He said the storm cell that passed over Garland County is the same one that produced the tornado that initially touched down in Little Rock. “We want to make sure it wasnt on the ground earlier in the Hot Springs vicinity,” Pope said. “Were also trying to confirm reports of possible damage in Stone County and also in Prairie County, near and just northeast of Des Arc, so those will be some places well be surveying in coming days. Sometimes we get damage reports that turn out to be straight line winds but we have to conduct a survey to know for sure.” Pope said it will take several days to complete the surveys and to release final information on the storms. The National Weather Service office in Memphis, which is responsible for eastern Arkansas including Cross County, said a preliminary report has determined the tornado that struck Wynne, destroying much of the town including the high school, was likely an EF-3, but said final determinations of wind speed, the width and length of the tornado track and total damage estimates will take time because of widespread damage in Tennessee and Mississippi associated with Fridays storms. Sheana Walsh, a staff meteorologist with the Memphis office said more information will be made available in coming days and survey teams continue inspecting the area. “Theyre still out in the field, still surveying,” Walsh said. “This could be a days thing but were comfortable right now with a preliminary reading of EF-3 for that particular tornado.” Pope said there is concern regarding a system approaching from the west that could bring another round of severe weather as early as Tuesday that was forecast to bring some rain to the area Sunday night as the warm front begins moving closer to the state. “This is going to prime the environment for the potential on Tuesday,” he said. “Well see a lot more moisture and a lot warmer temperatures that well notice Monday and even during the day on Tuesday. We expect the next round of severe weather, at least the potential for severe weather will be late Tuesday afternoon into Tuesday night.” On the heels of that system, Pope said, is a cold front that is expected to move into the state on Wednesday before stalling and becoming stationary near the Gulf of Mexico. That, he said, will funnel moisture into Arkansas through the end of the week making rain more likely. “Between now and Friday,” he said, “across far southern Arkansas, we could see anywhere from three to six inches of rain. The central part of the state could get anywhere from a half inch to two inches of rain and across northern Arkansas, they could see from a few tenths of an inch to upwards of an inch.” Persistent power outages As the storms moved through, in addition to damage to homes and businesses, electrical service was interrupted to 56,000 Entergy Arkansas customers throughout the state. An Entergy Arkansas spokeswoman, Brandi Hinkle, said as of Sunday evening, those outages have been reduced to 12,050 statewide and more than 3,000 linemen are working to restore existing outages. “Weve actually restored about 50,000 but thats because sometimes the power goes on and goes off, depending on the weather, trees continue to fall, limbs and things like that,” Hinkle said. “Also, weve had a lot of debris, not just tree limbs but roof shingles, trash, piles of debris that we have to maneuver around to get to the power lines … and these happen to be in heavily populated neighborhoods where we cant just pull up in a bucket truck. We have to use a lot of specialized equipment.” With damage to Entergys equipment 95% scouted and assessed, Hinkle said, crews are working to replace 1,500 damaged power poles, 400 transformers and some 2,000 spans of wire. Once the work is complete, however, Hinkle said much of the replaced infrastructure will be better able to withstand severe weather when it occurs. “Were replacing the broken power poles with larger poles and in some instances, concrete poles, so they should be more resilient going forward,” she said. “That doesnt mean theyre going to be tornado proof but we do hope they will be more resilient going forward because some of these power poles that were blown down are decades old. We dont necessarily replace poles unless they are damaged or decaying but this is a great opportunity to put newer equipment up.” Hinkle said Entergy officials are keeping a close eye on the sky over the next several days as a weather system moves closer to the state that is predicted to bring more severe weather, which could complicate restoration efforts. “A lot of the damage at this point is going to be small areas that are going to be difficult to access,” she said. “Typically, what we try to do is get the most people back on at a time along with our critical customers like hospitals, schools, churches, things like that.” Much of the remaining damage, Hinkle said, is in densely populated neighborhoods that take time to get into with the proper equipment, a process which she said takes time. “We do have additional crews in town but a lot of the damage thats left is going to be in those neighborhoods and in backyards,” she said. To meet the challenge, Hinkle said Entergy Arkansas has 3,000 “boots on the ground” with additional crews called in from Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas, as well as customer service representatives, schedulers, logistics personnel and others. Its an all-hands storm response,” she said. “Thats not unusual for us. We stay storm ready year-round because unfortunately in Arkansas we have to deal with storms, with ice, snow and weve had some of the worst tornadoes in history in March and April.” Weather events in Arkansas the past several years have tended to be extreme, Hinkle said. “Weve had the polar vortex, we actually had a hurricane that came this far inland, and of course, we have thunderstorms and tornadoes that cause a lot of damage,” she said. “We have to stay storm prepped year-round.” As of Sunday night, Hinkle said, Little Rock still had 7,276 customers without power, Wynne had 2,478, Jacksonville had 2,157, Sherwood had 430, and Cammackcq Village had 203. According to the outage map on its website, North Little Rock Electric had just under 8,000 outages Sunday night. Price gouging Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin said in a statement issued on Sunday that with the emergency declaration issued by Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the states anti-price gouging law, which prohibits businesses from increasing prices more than 10% above pre-disaster prices on goods such as food, water, fuel, blankets, medical supplies and construction materials is now in effect. Griffin said the price gouging law is triggered whenever a state of emergency is declared by federal, state or local governments and violations can carry fines of up to $10,000. Griffin said his office has received several phone calls from people concerned with price gouging, including one regarding a person from Mississippi looking for work clearing trees and other debris. “He indicated his understanding was that our law allows him to double or even triple his prices during a storm,” Griffin said. “We reached out and we educated him very quickly on Arkansas law … We straightened him out on what Arkansas law allows, what it doesnt allow and hopefully we wont hear any complaints about him.” Griffin said several other complaints, including one from eastern Arkansas concerning tree removal and another regarding room rates at a North Little Rock motel are being investigated. Several other complaints, he said, have been investigated and found to be legitimate service fees. “Its not just a matter of whether youve raised your price,” he said. “Its whether you raised it by a certain amount and whether you raised it for no reason. Certainly, if necessary, people need to be able to pay double overtime. If someone wants their tree removed immediately, thats going to cost more than a situation where it may be two weeks, that sort of thing.” Griffin said so far his office has stepped in before a violation of the law occurred but he said that for the duration of the emergency, anyone with concerns regarding price gouging should contact his office.  Gallery: Sunday Tornado Coverage  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        A staff meteorologist with the National Weather Service in North Little Rock said Sunday that officials are surveying three counties located west, north and east of Pulaski County to determine if damages reported there were caused by tornadoes or straight-line winds. Colby Pope said that surveyors are investigating an area in Garland County near Pine Mountain where damage reports were received. He said the storm cell that passed over Garland County is the same one that produced the tornado that initially touched down in Little Rock.  “We want to make sure it wasnt on the ground earlier in the Hot Springs vicinity,” Pope said. “Were also trying to confirm reports of possible damage in Stone County and also in Prairie County, near and just northeast of Des Arc, so those will be some places well be surveying in coming days. Sometimes we get damage reports that turn out to be straight-line winds, but we have to conduct a survey to know for sure.” Pope said there is some concern regarding a system approaching from the west that could bring another round of severe weather as early as Tuesday. As the warm front moves closer to Arkansas, some areas of the state could begin seeing rain on Sunday night. “This is going to prime the environment for the potential on Tuesday,” he said. “Well see a lot more moisture and a lot warmer temperatures that well notice Monday and even during the day on Tuesday. We expect the next round of severe weather, at least the potential for severe weather, will be late Tuesday afternoon into Tuesday night.” Pope said all hazards — high winds, large hail and tornadoes — are possible with the system. The National Weather Service office in North Little Rock has confirmed that Friday's EF-3 tornado, with winds reaching 165 miles per hour, that destroyed portions of west Little Rock, North Little Rock, Sherwood and Jacksonville cut a path of destruction through the metro area that stretched for 32 miles before the twister dissipated. Pope said on Sunday that surveyors have determined that the worst damage was along a northeast track from the North Shackleford Road area into west Little Rock before the storm crossed the Arkansas River into North Little Rock.

        The City of Little Rock is joining several community organizations Monday to start a Family Assistance Center in west Little Rock for residents affected by Fridays tornado. The centers hours will be from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. daily at The City Center, 315 N. Shackleford Road. “This is a significant community partnership that demonstrates the strength and resolve of our City,” said Little Rock Mayor Frank Scott Jr. “We are united in our commitment to serve those who were impacted by this storm as we move forward together to rebuild. Im humbled by the outpouring of support from not just this community, but from around the world. “With the Family Assistance Center, impacted residents will have direct and efficient access to the resources they need, all in one place. Im so grateful for the nonprofit organizations, community partners and everyone who has stepped up for their friends and neighbors in this time of need.” The Family Assistance Center is a partnership with Engage Arkansas, Arkansas Baptist Disaster Relief, the Salvation Army, Wolfe Street Foundation, Center for Youth and Families, Goodwill Industries and the United Way. Immanuel Baptist Church, which opened The City Center, is also part of the partnership. Affected residents will be able to access recovery resources such as water, food, and supplies. They may also work through the center to request volunteer crews to help with tree removal and tarp placement. Representatives with the Federal Emergency Management Agency will be onsite for residents who need federal assistance. The center will provide case workers and trauma-informed mental health services. The Little Rock School District will also have a representative at the center for families in transition, and city officials will offer municipal ID services to residents who may need them. Free lunches and dinners will be offered each day this week, according to a news release.  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         The city of North Little Rock conducted a tornado siren test at noon on Sunday, just two days after an EF3 tornado impacted several areas of the community. "Please be aware this is just a testing," two tweets from the city's police department read. "Please share with anyone in the North Little Rock area." Lt. Amy Cooper with the police department said the testing was necessary, even in the wake of Friday's tornado, due to possible weather conditions next week. "During the storm, one of the sirens was completely damaged, and the path of the storm took out other sirens in the affected area," Cooper said. "We needed to do a test because of the possible inclement and severe weather coming next week. We needed to test those sirens today so that we're able to inform citizens when there is terrible weather or when there is the risk of terrible weather." One person, presumably one of the city's residents, commented under the tweets regarding the siren testing. After the noon test was conducted, the person said, "I didn't hear the one nearest to me. Any way to find out if all the siren locations are working? Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         Little Rock Mayor Frank Scott Jr. confirmed Sunday that there are no reported fatalities in the city, following the EF3 tornado that impacted over 2,500 structures in the city Friday afternoon. Scott declared a state of emergency following a phone call with President Joe Biden and additional support the city received from Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. The mayor was joined Sunday morning by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in a press conference, which was held just outside of the heavily damaged Colony West Shopping Center. Attorney General Tim Griffin and Lt. Gov. Leslie Rutledge also spoke at the news conference on Sunday. The sounds of construction, chainsaws, trucks carrying loads of debris and hundreds of volunteers helping throughout the neighboring streets drowned out most of each speaker's comments. That continued through the end of the conference. City staff and community members have spent the days following the Friday storm coming together to clear roadways, provide free meals to those in need and offering their services where they can, the mayor said. “Were going to try and get operations back to as smooth as possible,” Scott said. “Its going to probably take months for a lot of these residential communities, as well as our commercial activity, to get back to normal. Its our first priority to do all we can to rebuild and recover for the residents of Little Rock and Central Arkansas.” FEMA representatives highlighted that their assistance can be used in many ways by those affected by the storm. Speakers with the federal organization reminded people that not every persons impact story will look the same or require the same assistance. Those seeking help from the agency will discuss what services are needed and will be directed to the necessary resources and help, they said.  Griffin urged those seeking help to be cautious before trusting online assistance that is offered to them. The attorney general said there have been two known instances of residents being scammed by people “price gouging” and over-charging for services. Griffin also said that his office and staff are actively monitoring other possible “price gouging” scenarios and handling them as needed. With over 50 injuries reported and thousands of residents still without power, Scott said the city will continue to post contact information and details for how to get in touch with the state and federal agencies for assistance. “Were just working in concert with state, federal and local partners to ensure that we respond with a great level of priority toward our residents,” Scott said. “Its a time to unite. As a city, as a state and as a region. Weve got to demonstrate our love.”  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         WASHINGTON — Former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson will run for president in 2024, he told ABC News on Sunday. A spokesperson for Hutchinsons campaign confirmed Hutchinson's intent to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, and said it would begin with an April 26 event in Bentonville. Hutchinson made his intentions clear Sunday following months of speculation and teases of a pending announcement. He spent part of last week speaking in Iowa, a key state in the presidential election season. “As Ive traveled the country for six months, I hear people talk about the leadership of our country,” he said. “Im convinced people want leaders that appeal to the best of America, and not simply appeal to our worst instincts.” Hutchinson, 72, enters the race with experience in state and federal politics. A former Arkansas Republican Party chairman, Hutchinson represented the states Third Congressional District from January 1997 to August 2001, which included serving as a manager during the impeachment trial of fellow Arkansan and then-President Bill Clinton. Hutchinson resigned from the House of Representatives to become administrator of the Drug Enforcement Agency. He joined the Department of Homeland Security in January 2003 and served as the under secretary on border and transportation security until March 2005. Hutchinson ran for governor in 2006, losing to Democrat Mike Beebe. He sought the office again in 2014, winning that years race and a 2018 bid for a second term. His record as governor includes income tax reductions, computer science education expansion and leading the state through the coronavirus pandemic, as well as a near-complete prohibition on abortion services and overhauling Arkansas Medicaid program. He left office in January after being term-limited. Prior to entering public office, Hutchinson served as U.S. attorney for Arkansas Western District. He successfully prosecuted a white supremacist group — The Covenant, The Sword and The Arm of the Lord — which involved negotiating an end to a standoff between the organization and law enforcement agencies. “Theres not a lot of people on the national stage that have served at all the different levels that he has served at,” said Jon Gilmore, a longtime Hutchinson aide and chairman of a pro-Hutchinson super PAC. “As you look at Gov. Hutchinson, I think his call to public service is clear. I think his call to serve is clear. And I think he wants to be an alternative. Whether that means hes successful or not in that run, I think, at the end of the day, hes doing it for the right reasons, which is the American people need to hear: alternative voices to Joe Biden and former President [Donald] Trump.” Trump was the first Republican to enter the race when he announced a third presidential campaign last November. Following Trumps indictment by a Manhattan grand jury last Thursday, Hutchinson — a critic of Trumps denial of the 2020 election results — called on Trump to drop out, striking a different tone than other Republicans who have labeled the inquiry as a politically motivated affair. “I think its a sad day for America that we have a former president thats indicted,” Hutchinson told ABC News. “Its a great distraction, but at the same time, we cant set aside what our Constitution requires, which is electing a new leader for our country, just because we have this side controversy and criminal charges that are pending.” Gilmore said he believes there is fatigue over Trump that will help Hutchinsons chances at a successful White House bid. “I think at this time, its time to move on. The people I talk to are ready to see change,” he said. Gilmore additionally drew from the experiences of himself and others in past election cycles when Republicans backed Trump after he became the partys presidential candidate. “President Trump had his time. He actually had good policies for America, but his rhetoric was also damaging,” he said. “At the end of the day, he had the opportunity [and] he lost the race for the presidency. I think he needs to go back and focus on his own issues that hes got going on in his life and his business and let someone else come to the forefront of the Republican Party.” Former South Carolina governor and United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley launched her presidential campaign in February, as did entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy. U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton of Little Rock has opted not to run for president in 2024 after considering a possible White House bid. More Republicans are expected to announce their presidential ambitions in the coming months. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has emerged as Trumps top opponent; the governor released a book last week, “The Courage to Be Free: Floridas Blueprint for Americas Revival,” laying out his vision for America. “This is one of the most unpredictable political environments that Ive seen in my lifetime,” Hutchinson said. “My message of experience, of consistent conservatism, of hope for our future and solving problems that face Americans, I think that resonates,” he continued. “Whenever I make the final announcement, Ill be everywhere, and I think its a plan that can work in this environment.” Jamie Harrison, chair of the Democratic National Committee, struck against Hutchinsons announcement, criticizing the former governors record in office. “After calling Donald Trump ‘the kind of transparent, straight-talking leader America needs, Asa Hutchinson now wants to rewrite history — but his support for Trump and the MAGA agenda speaks for itself,” Harrison said. “As governor, Hutchinson signed one of the strictest abortion bans in the country, ripped health care away from thousands of Arkansans, and advocated for taking away the ACAs protections for those with preexisting conditions. Hes just another extremist joining the ever-expanding race for the MAGA base.” Other Arkansans who have run for president include retired Army Gen. Wesley Clark; former first lady, U.S. senator and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton; and former Gov. Mike Huckabee. Huckabee has already announced his endorsement of Trump.

         LITTLE ROCK -- The House Education Committee approved a bill Thursday night to overhaul how the state funds public education. During a marathon meeting, the committee approved House Bill 1689, sponsored by Rep. Bruce Cozart, R-Hot Springs, that will create a new formula for how the state funds public schools. The bill is scheduled for a vote in the House of Representatives on Monday. If approved, school districts would receive a per-pupil base funding, and then additional weighted funding based on a variety of factors such as the number of special needs students, district size, population density or poverty. Cozart said the bill is based on how Tennessee funds public education. The state's funding formula is based on a school district with 500 students with schools receiving dollars on a per-student basis, taking in how much it should spend on teacher salaries, transportation and facilities, among other items. The current funding formula is flawed, Cozart said, as districts with fewer than 500 students are significantly underfunded when compared to their larger counterparts. "We have so many small districts that are underfunded because of that," Cozart said. The proposed formula calls for schools to receive additional funding for each student who is economically disadvantaged, resides in a small district, is in a sparsely populated area or experiences concentrated poverty. But exactly how it will work would be worked out at a later time, when lawmakers meet out of session. "You've got two years before this has or will become law," Cozart said. "If it's not going to work we can kill it," Cozart said. "There's a safeguard on it." But upending the current funding formula has some superintendents concerned, Executive Director of the Arkansas Association of Educational Administrators Mike Hernandez told the committee. School districts with few students in living in poverty or special education programs could stand to have their funding reduced, Hernandez said. "It sounds like we're wanting to keep the same [spending], and if that's the case then there are going to be some significant winners and losers," Hernandez said. Cozart said he could not answer how the funding would change for individual schools, saying lawmakers and state government officials would spend the next two years developing new rules to allocate. The bill would not affect the state's proposal for funding schools for the next two years, which the committee also advanced Thursday. If passed, Cozart's bill would not take effect until the 2025-26 school year. Arkansas' current funding formula for education dates back to the Supreme Court's ruling in Lake View School District v. Huckabee in 2002, finding the state's public school funding was inadequate and unconstitutional. Every two years lawmakers on the House and Senate education committees vote on recommendations on how to fund public schools. On Thursday, the House Education Committee agreed on a $75 million increase in funding for public education for the next school year. The bill is less than what lawmakers recommended in the fall as part of the adequacy process, but will fund a cost-of-living adjustment for teachers and raises for school staff. House Bill 1688 would increase the per-student foundation funding by $205 to $7,618 for the 2023-2024 school year. For the 2024-2025 school year, the legislation calls for the per-student funding to increase to $7,771. The per-student foundation funding for the 2023-2024 school year is $7,413. The bill will fund a $2-an-hour increase for classified full-time staff, which includes custodians, bus drivers, nurses and special education paraprofessionals, as well as a 1.8% cost-of-living adjustment in fiscal year 2024 and a 2.2% increase in fiscal year 2025. The bill moves to the House of Representatives on Monday for a vote.  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         With legislative leaders aiming to wrap up the session by Friday, the Arkansas General Assembly this week will consider a proposed general revenue budget for the next fiscal year, public safety overhaul and income tax bills, and decide whether to refer any proposed constitutional amendments to voters in the 2024 general election. During each regular session, state lawmakers may refer up to three proposed constitutional amendments. Monday will be the 85th day of the regular session. It would require a three-fourths vote of the 100-member House and the 35-member Senate to extend the session beyond Friday. Friday would be the 89th day of the session and April 14 would be the 96th day. The regular session lasted 118 days in 2021 and was 30 days longer than the 88-day regular session in 2019. The regular session lasted 86 days in 2017 and 82 days in 2015 during Asa Hutchinson's first session as governor. A public safety bill that aims to overhaul the state's parole system is on the Senate agenda for Monday, said sponsor Sen. Ben Gilmore, R-Crossett, in a written statement Friday. Senate Bill 495, which is part of a broader public safety package advanced by Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, has 23 co-sponsors in the 35-member Senate. To advance from the chamber, the bill must receive 18 votes. Rep. Carol Dalby, R-Texarkana, who chairs the House Committee on Judiciary, said she expects her panel to hear the bill Tuesday along with any other bills passed out of the Senate. She said Friday that she anticipated gaveling the panel out of session at the end of the meeting. Among other provisions, SB495 would require incarcerated people to serve 100%, 85%, 50% or 25% of their sentences, depending on the severity of their convicted crimes. Offenders convicted of the most violent felonies, including rape and capital murder, would have to serve 100% of their prison sentences. Those convicted of lesser violent felonies, such as second-degree murder, battery in the first degree or sexual indecency with a child, would have to serve 85% of their sentence before being eligible for release with supervision. Incarcerated people convicted of felonies not addressed in the bill could be eligible to serve 50% or 25% of their sentence depending on a seriousness grid or table established by the Arkansas Sentencing Commission and approved by the Arkansas Legislative Council. The bill would require the state Board of Corrections to develop rules setting guidelines for the accrual of earned release credits for work practices, job responsibilities, good behavior and involvement in rehabilitative activities. The 131-page bill, which would create the "Protect Arkansas Act" if enacted, features other provisions including establishing a task force to study Arkansas' high rate of recidivism, requiring the creation of a new bail reporting system, increasing penalties for certain charges and allowing the Administrative Office of the Courts to contract attorneys to serve in specialty courts. Those in favor of the bill say it is needed to provide stricter sentences for people convicted of serious felonies and to offer clarity to juries on how long a person will spend in prison based on their sentence. Critics have said extending prison sentences does little to deter future crime and pointed to Arkansas' already high rate of incarceration. Some people who testified on the measure last week requested lawmakers provide the public with more time to process the bill. SB495 was filed Monday and passed out of the Senate Committee on Judiciary on Wednesday. Kymara Seals, policy director at the Arkansas Public Policy Panel, told the committee she would like to see more input from community members. "The way these bills are coming through here, we just feel like you just run them through," said Seals. "A lot of people that wanted to come and just share and be part of this, they haven't even gotten to read the bill." On Thursday, House Speaker Matthew Shepherd, R-El Dorado, said he feels the bill is not being rushed. "Our legislative sessions are relatively short in comparison so bills in Arkansas are able to move through in a few days or over the course of a couple weeks. This bill is no different," Shepherd said. "I feel that this bill is consistent with what has historically been the practice." With the regular session nearing its end, Shepherd said he thinks there is enough time, if needed, to amend the public safety bill in the House. "I think there could be an amendment, and I think there's still time if that were to occur," he said. In addition to House sponsor Rep. Jimmy Gazaway, R-Paragould, 66 representatives have signed on as co-sponsors. The bill needs only 51 votes to pass in the 100-member House. GENERAL REVENUE BUDGET The state's general revenue budget would increase by $177.7 million to $6.2 billion in fiscal year 2024 that begins July 1 under the proposed Revenue Stabilization Act developed by legislative leaders and Sanders' administration. Most of the increased general revenue would go to education and corrections programs under the proposal released by legislative leaders late Friday afternoon. The Revenue Stabilization Act prioritizes the distribution of state general revenue to state-supported programs. The general revenue allocation to the state's public school fund would increase by $118.7 million to $2.4 billion in fiscal 2024 under the proposal. General revenue totaling $31.7 million would be allocated for the Education Freedom Accounts to help pay for students to attend private, parochial or home schools in the next fiscal year. Sanders' education overhaul law, Act 237, raises the state's minimum teacher salary from $36,000 to $50,000 a year, grants other teachers $2,000 salary increases, creates Educational Freedom Accounts and enacts many other changes in the education system. The House Education Committee on Thursday endorsed House Bill 1688 by Rep. Brian Evans, R-Cabot, which would increase per-student foundation funding by $205 to $7,618 for the 2023-2024 school year and to $7,771 for the 2024-2025 school year. Full-time classified staff, bus drivers, custodians and other school workers would receive funding for about a $2-per-hour raise, Evans said. In addition, the state would fund a 1.8% cost-of-living adjustment for teachers and school secretaries in fiscal year 2024 and a 2.2% increase in fiscal year 2025, he said. Under the proposed Revenue Stabilization Act for fiscal 2024, the state Division of Correction would get a $55.3 million increase in general revenue to $434 million and the Arkansas State Police would get a $10.5 million increase to $88.6 million in fiscal 2024. The state's colleges and universities would get a $5.6 million increase in general revenue to $781 million under the proposal with the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences getting a $5 million increase to $93 million. The state's general revenue allocation to the state's Department of Human Services would increase by $5.5 million to $1.8 billion under the proposal. The state's net general revenue forecast projects net general revenue of $6.59 billion in fiscal year 2024, so the proposed general revenue budget of $6.2 billion would leave a general revenue surplus of $391.1 million at the end of fiscal 2024. The proposed Revenue Stabilization Act for fiscal 2024 will be considered by the Joint Budget Committee and the House and Senate this week. INCOME TAX CUTS The Senate Revenue and Taxation Committee on Monday is scheduled to consider legislation that would implement the income tax cut that Sanders and legislative leaders announced Thursday. The bill is Senate Bill 549 by Sen. Jonathan Dismang, R-Searcy. The state's top individual income tax rate would be cut from 4.9% to 4.7% and the state's top corporate income tax rate would be cut from 5.3% to 5.1%, retroactive to Jan. 1, 2023. The top individual income tax rate of 4.7% would apply to Arkansans having more than $87,000 in net income and to their income of $8,801 and above, for tax years starting on or after Jan. 1, 2023, under Senate Bill 549. That top rate also would apply to Arkansans having net income of less than $87,000 and their income of $24,300 to $87,000 for tax years starting on or after Jan. 1, 2023. The top corporate income tax rate of 5.1% would apply to net income of corporations exceeding $25,000 for tax years starting on or after Jan. 1, 2023. Sanders said Thursday the measure would provide about $100 million in income tax relief and about $24 million in corporate income tax relief. PROPOSED CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS The House State Agencies and Governmental Affairs Committee will decide Monday afternoon whether to recommend that the House consider one proposed constitutional amendment, two proposals or none, said committee Chairman Rep. Dwight Tosh, R-Jonesboro. He said two constitutional amendments proposed by Rep. Robin Lundstrum, R-Elm Springs, "were the two top vote-getters" in the House committee members' rankings of the constitutional amendments proposed by representatives. Representatives filed 13 proposed amendments. House Joint Resolution 1006 by Lundstrum would allow lottery proceeds to be used to fund or provide scholarships to citizens of the state enrolled in a public or private nonprofit two-year or four-year school, a public or private vocational-technical school, or a public or private technical institute located in the state that is certified according to criteria established by the General Assembly. Amendment 87 to the Arkansas Constitution, approved by voters in 2008, limits these scholarships and grants to citizens of the state enrolled in "public and private non-profit two year and four year colleges and universities located within the State that are certified according to criteria established by the General Assembly." According to Lundstrum, the aim of the proposal is to fund "'hard' vocational training needs such as LPN nursing, trucking, HVAC, electrical, refrigeration, industrial maintenance ... mechanical, plumbing, etc." House Joint Resolution 9 by Lundstrum would allow for the election of state Supreme Court justices, state Court of Appeals members, circuit judges and district judges on a partisan basis. In 2000, voters approved Amendment 80 of the Arkansas Constitution to provide for the election of state Supreme Court justices, Appeals Court members, circuit judges and district judges on a nonpartisan basis. Amendment 80 became effective July 1, 2001. The Senate State Agencies and Governmental Affairs Committee will meet Tuesday to decide whether to recommend the Senate consider any of the constitutional amendments proposed by senators, said committee Chairman Sen. Blake Johnson, R-Corning. Senators filed 20 proposed amendments. There is "nothing that screamed out to me personally," he said when asked about whether any of these proposals have emerged as favorites in the Senate. "I am going to try to poll folks this weekend," Johnson said Friday. In February, Sen. David Wallace, R-Leachville, said Sanders' staff provided a proposed constitutional amendment to him and indicated Sanders wanted him to run the proposal. Wallace's Senate Joint Resolution 10 was amended last week and is aimed at providing rights for victims of violent and sexual criminal offenses. Under Wallace's proposal, to preserve and protect victims' rights to justice and due process, a victim would have 13 specified rights. These rights would range from the right to be treated with fairness, respect and dignity and to be free from intimidation, harassment or abuse throughout the criminal process, to the right to refuse "an interview, a deposition or the release of documents not found in the prosecuting attorney's or the court's file when requested by the defendant, the defendant's attorney or other person acting on behalf of the defendant." The proposed amendment states it would not create any cause of action for compensation or damages against the state; a political subdivision of the state; an officer, employee or agent of the state or any of its political subdivisions; an officer or employee of the court; or an employee of a city attorney's office.

         Not long after he opened Jacksonville Guitar Center in 1975, Steve Evans started hanging framed photos of local bands in the store. Many of his customers were musicians who played in groups, and displaying their pictures in the shop was a cool thing to do. It took a couple of years to catch on, but by the time Evans retired and sold the building and its inventory in 2020, he'd amassed a collection of about 300 images of bands. Some were famous -- Black Oak Arkansas, Amy Lee from Evanescence, Kris Allen -- but most weren't. There were photos of rock bands, country bands, R&B groups and gospel groups with names like Gibraltar, Roxx, Spoonfed and The Opposition. Sprinkled among the locals were photos of legends like Joe Walsh, Eddie Van Halen and Ringo Starr. "If it was a slow day at the store, I would just walk around and look at these pictures. They were my friends and customers," Evans, 66, said last week. These aren't exactly Annie Leibovitz-level photos, but they are a document of the Arkansas music scene from the '70s to the 2000s; a treasure trove of questionable fashion/styling choices and a reminder of how musicians publicized themselves before social media. The collection may have been lost had it not been for Evans and longtime customer Harold Ott. When Evans learned that the building's new owner had taken the photos down, he contacted Ott, who loaded them in his Toyota Camry and brought them home. He scanned the images and posted them last week in a YouTube slideshow called "Jacksonville Guitar -- Wall of Photos." "Harold was the perfect guy for this," Evans said. The 47-year-old Ott is the mad genius behind Psyche of the South, a website and record label dedicated to documenting the rural South's contributions to '60s psychedelic and garage rock. He was also played guitar in Lollygadget, the '90s grunge-metal band whose photo hung at the store. Ott remembers visiting the shop and perusing the pictures. "It was the wall of dreamers, in a way. Many of the bands had broken up by the time I was looking at their photos. It was like a museum." He is planning a Facebook page that will feature the images and allow people to comment about their memories. "It's important to preserve these things," he said. "You're grabbing it from the hand of time before it's ultimately gone." email: sclancy@adgnewsroom.com  Print Headline: Collection of photos is rockin Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         The Central Arkansas Library System's executive director has pledged that the library system will defend employees who might be charged under a new state law that exposes library personnel to criminal charges for "knowingly" distributing material found to be obscene. Senate Bill 81, which Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed on Thursday, removes existing language from state law that shields library personnel as well as school employees from prosecution for disseminating obscene material. A person who loans out from a public library material found to be obscene could be charged with a Class D felony under the law. The legislation also creates a new Class A misdemeanor offense for knowingly furnishing a "harmful item" to a minor. Additionally, it establishes parameters for citizens to challenge the appropriateness of material available to the public that is held in school or public libraries. Successful challenges could result in material being relocated to an area not accessible to minors. Decisions not to relocate the challenged material could be appealed to a school district's board, in the case of a school library, or the governing body of a city or county, in the case of municipal or county libraries. Central Arkansas Library System Executive Director Nate Coulter's statements came before Sanders' office announced on Friday that the governor had signed into law SB81 along with many other pieces of legislation the day before. The legislation affecting schools and libraries will go into effect 90 days after the end of the legislative session. "Between now and then, CALS and others who believe this bill is censorship will assess various litigation strategies for getting judicial review of the new law," Coulter said in a written report prepared for a library system board meeting Thursday. "Although it strikes me as extremely unlikely to happen in Pulaski or Perry Counties, I have assured our staff that it will be CALS' policy to defend any of our employees who might be subjected to charges arising out of this misguided law," he added. Elaborating on SB81 at the library system's board meeting Thursday, Coulter said he was operating under the assumption that the legislation will go into effect and the library system will have to "operate under its burdens, and we'll do what we have to do to comply with it." SB81 stipulates that each municipal and county library "shall have a written policy to establish guidelines for the selection, relocation, and retention of physical materials that are available to the public," and goes on to set requirements for the process of addressing challenged material. Currently, the Central Arkansas Library System's policy on reconsideration of library materials says any resident of the library system's service area can lodge an objection to an item in the collection, or a web site accessible through a library computer, by filling out a form. According to the policy, the executive director then appoints a committee to evaluate the challenged item, and its members make a recommendation to the executive director with regard to removal. Appeals of the executive director's decision go to the library system's board, which appoints its own committee to review the matter. Coulter on Thursday told library system board members that the organization's request for reconsideration policy and collection development policy will have to be reviewed because of the legislation. At the moment, public libraries in Arkansas are not subject to language in state law requiring them to have a material-challenge or collection development policy, according to Jennifer Chilcoat, the director of the Arkansas State Library. Nevertheless, the existence of these policies is very common among libraries, Chilcoat suggested by phone Friday. Existing language in state law says school districts must have a written policy for addressing challenged material. SB81 tweaks that language and sets new requirements for the challenge process.

        Although the LEARNS Act will increase public school teachers' minimum salaries to at least $50,000 and give $2,000 raises, districts must decide for themselves to what degree they can reward educators' experience and education, state officials and lawmakers said. However, education leaders say they won't know the full extent to which they can afford to compensate educators and other critical staff until the Legislature and governor approve a bill indicating how much funding will be provided by the state. As a result, many district officials who are preparing staff contracts for the 2023-2024 school year say they are worried about employee retention despite their enthusiasm for broad portions of the education overhaul.  The LEARNS Act is a 145-page new law championed by Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders that includes raising beginning teacher salaries from $36,000 to $50,000, offering other teacher pay incentives, eliminating teacher and support staff job protections, creating a voucher system that would give families access to public funding for home school costs or private school tuition, creating a dual diploma system to prepare students for the workforce, funding for 120 reading coaches, and providing $500 grants for tutors for academically struggling kindergarten-through-third graders. State Sen. Breanne Davis, R-Russellville, and Rep. Keith Brooks, R-Little Rock, sponsored the bill, which was filed Feb. 20. The bill made its way through the Legislature over the course of three weeks. Sanders signed the LEARNS Act into law March 8, exactly one month after she unveiled the package. [READ MORE: What you need to know about the Arkansas LEARNS Act » arkansasonline.com/learns] FUNDING FOR LEARNS The state is paying for the entirety of the $50,000 minimum salary increases and $2,000 raises for teachers, according to state Education Secretary Jacob Oliva. The increase will affect traditional public schools and public charter schools. "Every teacher is going to be funded," he said. Roughly $300 million from the state will be used to fund the initiatives in LEARNS, the education secretary said. The LEARNS Act will cost the state $297.5 million, according to a study from the Education Department. Of that, Oliva said about $150 million will be re-prioritized with current dollars from within the Department of Education, as well as federal dollars the agency already has access to. Brooks said the other half will largely come from the state's general revenue funds. A portion will also come from federal funds awarded to the state under the American Rescue Plan Act, according to the representative. "It's not coming from any dollars that have been allocated to school districts," Oliva said. In year two, the cost will increase to $343.3 million, including $250 million in new funding. Pay for teachers will cost the state $180 million. The law's voucher program will cost $46.7 million in the first year and $97.5 million in the second year, according to the Department of Education. In the third year, the program will cost the state an estimated $175 million, said Robert Brech, deputy director of budget at the Department of Finance and Administration. The Education Department has distributed a five-page draft document estimating the funding each district would be provided for the salary increases and raises for the next school year. [DOCUMENT: State Department of Education draft of teacher minimum salary and raise funds » arkansasonline.com/42draft/] The agency used snapshots of school data known as "cycles" to make those estimates, according to Oliva. In addition to money provided through LEARNS, however, districts will continue to receive per-pupil funding through the adequacy process. That adequacy process determines how much the state will spend on public schools for the next two years. The per-student foundation funding is the largest part of state funding for public education. Schools also receive supplemental state and federal funds for education. The Bryant School District, for instance, generally gets about 55% of its funding from the state, while the other 45% comes from local taxes, according to Superintendent Karen Walters. "LEARNS is a bill to support teaching and learning and comes funded from a separate category. Districts have those dollars," Oliva said. "They're keeping those dollars. They get to decide the value they want to put on those dollars and where they go." SALARY SCHEDULE COMPRESSION Despite the promise of full funding for raises required by LEARNS, some education leaders have said their districts will struggle to fairly compensate teachers for their experience or education levels as a result of the law. As a result, they worry educators will leave their districts for others that can afford more broader pay scales. That arrangement, in which teachers with greater experience or a higher level of education receive additional pay, is known as a "salary schedule." Each level of additional pay is called a "step." LEARNS repeals the state's salary schedule for teachers, instead requiring each school district to come up with its own pay structure for educators. Davis said districts will have the freedom to develop a salary schedule that meets their needs. "They have the flexibility to keep it however they would like," she said. "That's up to them to have those conversations and decide what they want to do." However, some superintendents have pointed out that if they wish to maintain a scale similar to the one they used before LEARNS, the cost to their districts could be in the millions. First-year teachers in a district where the minimum salary is $36,000 would see a $14,000, or 38%, increase in pay to $50,000. A teacher with several years of experience and a $48,000 salary would see only a $2,000, or 4%, increase funded by LEARNS. Any additional compensation for experience or education would have to be paid through other means.  Many superintendents say it is only fair to veteran teachers for districts to maintain a strong salary scale under LEARNS. However, some say smaller districts will struggle to afford that. Arkansas Association of Educational Administrators Executive Director Mike Hernandez acknowledged that changes to salary schedules would likely be necessary for at least some districts, and that many may not be able to maintain a salary schedule similar to what they had prior to the law. "It's likely there won't be enough to do that," he said. "So they're going to have to make some decisions about how they alter their compensation packages in the future." Walters said keeping the Bryant School District's salary schedule at a scale similar to what it was before LEARNS was signed would cost her district $7 million. While the superintendent said she didn't think the intention of LEARNS was ever for districts to keep their salary schedules the way they were prior to the law, she said, "I am concerned about what this is going to look like for the teachers that have taught for 15 years or more. The way we're being funded it looks to me like a lot of people are going to be frozen." [RELATED: Work groups to develop rules for LEARNS implementation] As the district has to get contracts out soon, the superintendent said it must move forward with what is required in the law and then work with its personnel policies committee to craft their salary schedule. Walters said of her experienced teachers, "While I know that they're happy to get a $2,000 raise next year, for some of them I think that will be the only raise they get for some time." Several educators in the Bryant School District also began pursuing master's degrees with the belief that they would receive a $4,000 raise upon completion. Walters said that, as a result of LEARNS, she can no longer guarantee that raise. "I've heard from a few of them that they wish they had not taken out their student loans since that's not going to be a part of the LEARNS bill," she said. Superintendent Jeremy Owoh of the Jacksonville North Pulaski School District expressed similar concerns. It would cost his district an additional $2.3 million to keep sustainable increments from the $50,000 minimum through the district's current 28 steps and through lane changes for advanced degrees. "If you're a small district with a low tax base, how do you really sustain that and give increments year after year for teachers who stay with you?" he asked. Owoh said he believed smaller or rural districts will see an increase in teachers leaving their districts for others with higher salary scales. "I really feel like it's going to pit neighboring districts against each other and we're going to see a lot of mobility among teachers and licensed staff members," he said. However, Owoh said his district aims to ensure it continues to offer competitive salaries. "We're committed to making sure that we invest financially and also professionally in our staff, because we know they directly impact our young people," he said.  The necessity for districts to reevaluate their salary schedules may encourage some to consider alternatives to traditional models, such as one that incentivizes work performance, Hernandez said. "[LEARNS] kind of gives some flexibility to the districts where they don't necessarily have to reward years of experience or degrees," he said. Some districts in states such as Maryland and Texas have leaned into providing greater incentives for work and performance. Even personnel managers in Arkansas have studied different compensation measures over the years, Hernandez said. [TELL US: What questions do you have about Arkansas LEARNS?] Still, he acknowledged it can be difficult for districts to come around to the idea of adopting a different pay structure, especially because they have been required to follow a schedule that has traditionally required steps and lanes. "It hasn't allowed for that creativity," he said. "And of course when I say that, it doesn't mean creativity is always good. It just, oftentimes when you change from that it is scary. I think that needs to be acknowledged that it's different but it doesn't mean that it's bad." The LEARNS Act also creates a "merit teacher incentive fund program." Under the program, teachers who meet certain requirements are eligible for "annual bonuses of no more than $10,000." The funding for those bonuses will not come from school districts' pockets, and a work group will be formed to design the program application determining qualifications for merit pay, according to Oliva. NOT COVERED BY LEARNS FUNDING Raises provided by LEARNS are intended only for schools' certified staff paid for through state funds, such as teachers. Any raises districts plan to give for classified staff, such as bus drivers, custodians and cafeteria workers, or employees in federally funded positions must be funded through other sources. Wages for classified staff are handled through the adequacy funding process that is still working its way through the Legislature, said Brooks, the representative from Little Rock. An adequacy funding bill that would provide a $2-an-hour increase for classified staff was advanced by the House Education Committee on Thursday. Payment for certified staff members working longer than 190 days is also not covered under LEARNS, according to Walters. The superintendent said staff with such extended contracts include principals, assistant principals, and secondary counselors at high schools. Because of the number of certified staff working over 190 days, the district is short about $500,000 to provide the salary increases required by LEARNS, she said Hernandez said districts may have to decide whether to stop those contracts beyond 190 days or pay them a daily rate. "They are having to figure out what they're going to do moving forward, if they're going to keep those rates that way, or they maybe make an adjustment to their salary schedule," he said. FOUNDATION FUNDING UNFINALIZED Lawmakers are working to finalize the next round of adequacy funding for the 2023-2024 and 2024-2025 academic years. Until that is completed, district officials remain uncertain how much money they will get from the state to fund salary schedule changes, pay for classified and extended contract staff and for other expenses. Lawmakers hope to finalize funding before April 7, when they plan to go home or on recess. Walters said that, by now, she has usually provided the Bryant School Board with a drafted budget for the next school year. However, she doesn't want to plan out a possible budget, only to start over once she knows how much foundation funding the district will receive. "I have not even started on a budget for next year because I don't have any idea what my revenue is going to be," she said. A funding bill sponsored by Rep. Brian Evans of Cabot and Sen. Jane English of North Little Rock, both Republicans, was filed March 23. House Bill 1688 calls for an increase in the per-student foundation funding by $205 to $7,618 for the 2023-2024 school year. For the 2024-2025 school year, the legislation calls for the per-student funding to increase to $7,771. The per-pupil funding for the 2022-2023 school year is $7,413. The per-pupil funding in the bill is less than the $8,129 the House and the $8,150 Senate committees recommended in November for the total foundation funding rate for the 2023-2024 school year. He also said the per-student funding was less than what lawmakers initially proposed because of a lack of need to increase insurance for full-time staff. The bill calls for the school districts to pay a health insurance contribution rate set by the General Assembly. A bill filed March 24 aims to overhaul the way Arkansas funds public schools, however. House Bill 1689 sponsored by Rep. Bruce Cozart, R-Hot Springs, would create a new formula that more heavily weighs factors such as district size, population density and poverty. The proposed formula would create a fairer system that funnels more resources to schools that need it, he said. The bill would not take effect until the 2025-2026 school year. As a former superintendent, Oliva said he recognizes this is the time that districts are planning out programs and priorities for the next school year. "They just want to know where they are and how to plan some of it moving forward," he said. However, districts would be concerned about their foundation funding regardless of the education overhaul, according to Oliva. "Until I see what the state settles on the foundation funding, until I see where we settle with federal entitlement grants, until we see all the legislative initiatives land, I would have that concern every year," Oliva said. The agency leader described it as a "normal process." Information for this article was contributed by Neal Earley and Cynthia Howell of the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette.

         FAYETTEVILLE -- An idea for a coffee shop at Mount Sequoyah may lead to a rezoning for the entire top of the ridge. The nonprofit group behind Mount Sequoyah is developing a planned zoning district covering nearly 29 acres. The acreage includes the office, dining hall, cottages, overlook, performance venues, open spaces, historic structures and other buildings within the boundary created by Skyline Drive. The group says it wants to rezone to have a plan that more accurately reflects the use of the property and provides room to grow. Neighbors say they want to keep the character of the hilltop intact and dissuade major developments that could create nuisances such as increased traffic, noise and flooding below. A planned zoning district is a more specific type of zoning district. Existing zonings are listed on the city's website and include a number of permitted and conditional land uses. A planned zoning district enables a property owner to have a more tailored zoning plan for a property. It can be as simple as some words describing land uses or as specific as a map pinpointing placement and types of buildings with desired land uses or with self-imposed restrictions outlined. The planned zoning district for Mount Sequoyah is scheduled to appear on the Fayetteville Planning Commission's April 24 agenda. However, the nonprofit group asked for the request to be held so revisions can be made to the plan submitted to the city. The commission reviews zoning requests first and, if approved, forwards the requests to the City Council for approval. Mount Sequoyah hosted a meeting with neighbors last week to get feedback on the plan. Reaction ranged from cautious optimism to outright rejection. Nonprofit staff and board members say they'll alter the plan based on the feedback. ZONING REGULATIONS The property's zoning became the subject of discussion after the owner of Clubhaus Fitness, Stuart Walker, asked the nonprofit about setting up a coffee shop after Clubhaus moved to Mount Sequoyah from downtown. The nonprofit, Mount Sequoyah Center Inc., has owned the top of the ridge since 2016. Before then, United Methodist Church owned the property. The church transferred ownership to the nonprofit group for free. The church withdrew the $160,000 it provided annually to the center. The nonprofit has its own board overseeing staff and governance of the property. The entire top of the ridge is under an institutional zoning. That type of zoning typically is reserved for churches, hospitals, schools and government buildings. It has one of the more restrictive sets of land uses in the city compared with other types. For instance, only a few land uses are allowed: city and other government uses and facilities, cultural and recreational facilities and short-term rentals. Other land uses are allowed with a permit from the Planning Commission. Those include multifamily dwellings, public protection and utility facilities, wireless communications facilities and clean technologies such as solar arrays. An institutional zone has no building density limitation, but it has some setback regulations. Buildings have to be at least 30 feet from the public right of way, or, if there's a parking lot between the building and the right of way, 50 feet back. There is no set height limitation, but any buildings more than two stories tall have to sit a certain distance from any residential-zoned properties. Coffee shops aren't allowed in an institutional zone. To have such a business, the nonprofit would need to seek a rezoning, said Jonathan Curth, the city's development services director. Planning staff said a request should include whatever the group wants to do with the property, he said. Emily Gentry, president and chief executive officer of the nonprofit, said the center wants to make more money. Mount Sequoyah costs about $1.5 million annually to operate. It got about $96,000 in private donations last year. It received about $330,000 in grants for specific programs. Most of its money comes from fees charged to outside groups and individuals for use of the property, such as for weddings, family reunions or overnight lodging. It also receives rent from tenants such as artists and Clubhaus Fitness. The nonprofit has stayed in the black financially since taking over, but utility costs are rising, and the property has several aging buildings that need frequent repair, Gentry said. The center also hopes to add to its staff, which will require additional, ongoing sources of money, she said. Ideas such as a coffee shop or putting a rooftop deck on Sequoyah Hall -- another idea the group has -- wouldn't be allowed under the current zoning, Gentry said. BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD Nonprofit group staff and board members put together the planned zoning district submitted to the city. They started with a zoning district that already exists in city code called Community Services. A Community Services zone has several land entitlements listed. Among the permitted uses are residences, eating places, shopping, offices and studios. Uses allowed with a permit from the Planning Commission include hotels, outdoor music establishments, liquor stores and commercial recreation. Buildings have to sit 10 to 25 feet from the right of way and can be as high as five stories. Gentry said for the most part, the nonprofit used Community Services as a basis and added land uses to it, without taking many away. That's where issues cropped up with neighbors, she said. The nonprofit group can impose restrictions on itself with its planned zoning district. Chris Baribeau, with local architecture firm Modus Studio, serves on the group's board and helped create the proposal. He lives next to Mount Sequoyah and said he's invested in what happens there. "I believe in the importance of finding a balance between Mount Sequoyah's growth and the preservation of our neighborhood's unique character," Baribeau said. "Our goal is to move forward in a dialogue that encourages collaboration and fosters understanding." Baribeau said at last week's meeting he plans to get much more specific about the plan and clearly outline what developments wouldn't be allowed. For instance, as written, the plan would allow construction of a five-story hotel. Nonprofit group members told neighbors they have no intention of doing such a project, nor do they have any specific building plans. The uncertainty over what may happen is causing concern among neighbors, resident Cecil North said. Even if the nonprofit doesn't plan to build something like a five-story hotel, a future landowner could do so if restrictions aren't in place, he said. The plan as written essentially gives the owners of Mount Sequoyah a blank slate to do whatever they want, including a major amount of development, North said. What happens matters to neighbors because they will be affected directly, he said. Traffic can already be dangerous, and major development could exacerbate the issue, North said. Mount Sequoyah hosts musical performances, but for now neighbors can't hear the noise. Building an amplified music venue could change that, he said. Additionally, North said a significant amount of development could pose flooding hazards for homes at the bottom of the hill. North said he understands Mount Sequoyah's need to stay financially stable, but the plan for now goes way beyond what is necessary. Neighbors want to see the group come up with a more specific plan that would not have developments popping up years from now that could disrupt lives, he said. "I think everybody's very open-minded about this," North said. "I haven't talked to anyone who's said, 'We absolutely don't want a single blade of grass moved at the top of the mountain.'"

         The House Education Committee approved a bill Thursday night to overhaul how the state funds public education. During a marathon meeting, the committee approved House Bill 1689, sponsored by Rep. Bruce Cozart, R-Hot Springs, that will create a new formula for how the state funds public schools. The bill is scheduled for a vote in the House of Representatives on Monday. If approved, school districts would receive a per-pupil base funding, and then additional weighted funding based on a variety of factors such as the number of special needs students, district size, population density or poverty. Cozart said the bill is based on how Tennessee funds public education. The state's funding formula is based on a school district with 500 students with schools receiving dollars on a per-student basis, taking in how much it should spend on teacher salaries, transportation and facilities, among other items. The current funding formula is flawed, Cozart said, as districts with fewer than 500 students are significantly underfunded when compared to their larger counterparts. "We have so many small districts that are underfunded because of that," Cozart said. The proposed formula calls for schools to receive additional funding for each student who is economically disadvantaged, resides in a small district, is in a sparsely populated area or experiences concentrated poverty. But exactly how it will work would be worked out at a later time, when lawmakers meet out of session. "You've got two years before this has or will become law," Cozart said. "If it's not going to work we can kill it," Cozart said. "There's a safeguard on it." But upending the current funding formula has some superintendents concerned, Executive Director of the Arkansas Association of Educational Administrators Mike Hernandez told the committee. School districts with few students in living in poverty or special education programs could stand to have their funding reduced, Hernandez said. "It sounds like we're wanting to keep the same [spending], and if that's the case then there are going to be some significant winners and losers," Hernandez said. Cozart said he could not answer how the funding would change for individual schools, saying lawmakers and state government officials would spend the next two years developing new rules to allocate. The bill would not affect the state's proposal for funding schools for the next two years, which the committee also advanced Thursday. [DOCUMENT: Read Cozart's proposal for school funding » arkansasonline.com/42hb1689/]  If passed, Cozart's bill would not take effect until the 2025-2026 school year. Arkansas' current funding formula for education dates back to the Supreme Court's ruling in Lake View School District v. Huckabee in 2002, finding the state's public school funding was inadequate and unconstitutional. Every two years lawmakers on the House and Senate education committees vote on recommendations on how to fund public schools. On Thursday, the House Education Committee agreed on a $75 million increase in funding for public education for the next school year. The bill is less than what lawmakers recommended in the fall as part of the adequacy process, but will fund a cost-of-living adjustment for teachers and raises for school staff. House Bill 1688 would increase the per-student foundation funding by $205 to $7,618 for the 2023-2024 school year. For the 2024-2025 school year, the legislation calls for the per-student funding to increase to $7,771. The per-student foundation funding for the 2023-2024 school year is $7,413. The bill will fund a $2-an-hour increase for classified full-time staff, which includes custodians, bus drivers, nurses and special education paraprofessionals, as well as a 1.8% cost-of-living adjustment in fiscal year 2024 and a 2.2% increase in fiscal year 2025. The bill moves to the House of Representatives on Monday for a vote.  Print Headline: Committee approves bill on school funding Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         Thieves and looters normally steal what they can carry, but Russian occupiers in Ukraine steal everything, said Samuel Totten, a University of Arkansas professor emeritus. "The thing I keep hearing over and over is how the Russians move in and assume they own everything," Totten said of his interviews with Ukrainians fleeing the fighting during Russia's invasion. "In one case, the military went in and sold the town's police cars. They sold one for the price of 10 burgers. I couldn't believe it. I asked, 'For the price of 10 burgers like you'd buy at McDonald's?' It's so outlandish it's hard to believe." "The Russian military sets up block posts" in towns they occupy, he said. Checkpoints are common in military occupations, but in the Russian occupation, "you're not allowed to leave or enter an area without a pretty large bribe." Totten is a trained field researcher. The U.S. State Department recruited him to research genocide and war crimes. He studied genocide firsthand in Sudan's Darfur region and Chad for nearly 40 years. He's a published author on genocide who has served as a co-editor of Genocide Studies and Prevention, the official journal of the International Association of Genocide Scholars. The 74-year-old retiree traveled from his lakeside home east of Springdale to Lviv, a city in western Ukraine, on his own to take statements from people fleeing the invasion. He arrived in Lviv on March 18, he said. "I came to Ukraine as a trained outsider," Totten said. "I want to conduct and collect interviews and hand those records over to the International Criminal Court." The statements Totten takes -- a process taking hours with each interviewee -- will add to the evidence amassed by the court from others like him and the court's own investigators, he said. Those witness statements will help sort fact from fiction, cross-referenced with statements taken from other investigators and other evidence, he said. Ukrainians are astonished at what activists and nongovernmental organizations have done for them, Totten said. Totten is one of many investigators who came to Ukraine on their own time and expense, he said. His work earlier on the State Department's Darfur Atrocities Documentation Project "never saw the light of day. It was done for the State Department's internal use to decide if genocide had been committed," he said. The International Criminal Court in The Hague, Netherlands, was created by treaty. Started in 2002, the court is a permanent body to investigate and, when warranted, try cases of genocide and war crimes. The court issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin on March 17 for war crimes, specifically allegations Russia has and is continuing to kidnap Ukrainian children for adoption in Russia. The court also indicted Maria Alekseyevna Lvova-Belova, commissioner for children's rights in Putin's government. Totten said interviewing parents of a taken child is one of his priorities but he hasn't interviewed any yet. He planned to remain in Lviv until today and may return, he said. The Russian Federation released its 42-page statement of foreign policy doctrine Friday claiming accusations of war crimes are anti-Russian propaganda, part of a coordinated campaign to "weaken Russia in every possible way," as federation foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said in releasing the document. The doctrine statement accuses countries led by the United States of exploiting the war in Ukraine to form a coalition against Russia. The task of collecting evidence has not been easy, particularly in nailing down specific dates of when the atrocities they described occurred, Totten said. "I've never encountered so many confused people so quickly," Totten said of his time in Ukraine, during a interview Tuesday. "People in Darfur never had running water or electricity, so I'm thinking the shock to Ukrainians of losing those things right away is part of it," Totten said. Another aspect is the "absolutely savage and sadistic" treatment by the invaders. "One of the first things the Russians do when they come into a town is set up a 'basement,' a euphemism for a torture center," interviewees tell him, Totten said. "Ukrainians who commit certain actions such as protests go there." "In one town, the Russians came into a building, went to a balcony and started throwing grenades" according to one witness account, he said. Those statements and others should be investigated by the International Criminal Court and corroborated if possible, he said. Totten's interview sessions last 2½ to three hours, he said. "The most I've interviewed in a day is three people," he said. Local assistance is both generously offered and invaluable, he said. He traveled by air to Poland and by bus to Ukraine. Putin insists in public statements Ukraine is part of Russia that broke away after the collapse of the Soviet Union, that it oppresses ethnic Russian and Russian-speakers in Ukraine and persecutes the Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine. Asked whether Ukraine is Russian, Totten laughed. "That's not the way the Ukrainians see it," he said. The pride Ukrainians feel in their country and its resistance to the invasion is tangible, Totten said. "I interviewed one man who had a mortar shell blow up right in front of him," he said. "He has a colostomy, an arm broken in different places and wearing some sort of corset" that is a medical brace. "I thought he looked clinically depressed, but as I interviewed him he kept saying he was doing fine."

         LITTLE ROCK -- A 56-year-old Little Rock man who beat his former fiancee with a hammer so severely that her brain was exposed, her vision permanently damaged and one ear torn apart was sentenced to 35 years in prison Thursday after claiming he was the true victim in the case. Henri Dubois Hatten pleaded guilty last month to first-degree domestic battery for the December 2021 attack on 51-year-old Scherice Johnson at their Howard Street home. A repeat offender who has either been on probation or parole for the past 26 years, mostly for drug and property crimes, Hatten faced a maximum of 40 years in prison at Thursday's sentencing before Circuit Judge Karen Whatley. Johnson testified that she'd known Hatten for more than 20 years but that they'd been together romantically a couple of years -- living together about six weeks -- when Hatten attacked her without provocation as she got ready for work 10 days before Christmas 2021. She told the judge Hatten had been arrested the day before -- he'd been found with a counterfeit $100 bill -- and spent a few hours in jail before being released. That morning, Johnson said Hatten came into the bathroom looking for his wallet. He left when she told him she didn't know where it was but he quickly returned to ask her for money, Johnson said. When she told him she didn't have any cash, he swung at her with a hammer they kept in the kitchen. The first blow to the head knocked her into the bathtub, she said, describing for the judge how he kept after her with the tool, hitting her in the face and head before she could flee the apartment. Hatten left in her car before police arrived, leaving the broken hammer behind, with officers finding Johnson bleeding in the street with brain matter exposed. Deputy prosecutor Justin Harper showed the judge photographs of the bloody bathroom and hammer, with the judge saying the pictures were more gruesome than some murder crime-scene photographs she'd seen. Johnson told the judge she spent the next two months in the hospital, recovering from a head wound that took 17 staples to close. Her left ear had to be sewn back together, she said. The attack damaged her vision in her left eye, leaving her with a condition that significantly increases her risk for cataracts. Johnson said she lost her home and job during the ordeal but described her survival as a blessing, saying what she wanted most was to have Hatten out of her life forever. "I'm blessed to be here," she said. "I want to go on with my life. I've got a new job and a new life." Hatten began Thursday's sentencing by trying to withdraw his guilty plea, telling the judge that his lawyers, Leslie Borgognoni and Camille Wright, had bullied him into the plea. He said he wanted to take his case to a jury so he could show that he was protecting himself from a hammer-wielding Johnson, who had attacked him because she thought he had just come home after being with another woman. Hatten said he was within his rights to protect himself from her. "The only thing I'm guilty of is trying to save my life," he testified, showing the judge what he said was a hand injury he received defending himself from the hammer. "It was my life on the line that night. My attorneys told me to plead guilty because her injuries made it look like I used too much force." Hatten said he's never abused a woman before, telling the judge he's "not a bad person. I'm not a violent person." "I've been with lots of women in my life, but, aside from Ms. Johnson, none of them can say I've hit them." Hatten cried as he described how he feared he would never be released from prison, telling the judge he suffers from recurrent throat tumors that must be regularly surgically removed. He said he didn't think he would get proper medical treatment in prison and despaired of ever being released on parole. "I don't know how long I'm going to live," he said. At one point during his 15 minutes on the witness stand, Hatten decried a criminal justice system that would send a man overseas to fight for his country but wouldn't let him defend himself at home. Asked by the judge what branch of the services Hatten had served in, he replied that he had never been in the military but his father had. Testifying on Hatten's behalf was an older sister, Robbie Arbor; her daughter, Shamicia Arbor; and the oldest of Hatten's 10 siblings, Victor Hatten. They each expressed condolences for the attack, stating that the Henri Hatten they knew was loving and caring, a man who put his family first and goes out of his way to make them laugh. The family asked for mercy. "I hope ... I'm allowed to see my brother free one day," Victor Hatten told the judge. Hatten's been plagued by drug problems for most of his life, they said, telling the judge he's never had a meaningful chance at treatment for his addictions. The judge refused to let Hatten back out of his guilty plea, pointing out that she had extensively questioned him about why he was pleading guilty and whether he was satisfied with his attorneys' advice. When she questioned him about why he was pleading last month, Hatten had assured her he was pleading guilty because he had done what he had been charged with and also, when asked, expressed satisfaction with his lawyers. The judge further noted, observing that she had specifically questioned him about whether he had been coerced into the guilty plea and he had told her he had not. Canceling his plea would also mean Hatten would stand trial for more than just the domestic battery count, the judge said, since his plea agreement involved prosecutors dropping charges of attempted first-degree murder, aggravated robbery, felony theft and terroristic threatening as well as a forgery charge involving the counterfeit money, According to police reports, officers first encountered Hatten the afternoon before the hammer attack when they stopped him for speeding, 58 mph in a 30-mph zone, driving Johnson's 2005 Mercedes on Asher Avenue. As a parolee, Hatten was searched, with officers finding the fake bill in a shoe box on the back seat. He said he'd found the box at a car wash but did not know the bill was inside. About five hours before the attack, police were called to their home when Johnson reported that Hatten had taken the Mercedes without her permission, stating he'd gotten out of jail at midnight, arrived home about 1 a.m. then left with her car a few minutes later.

         The day after a North Little Rock man died on Sonora Drive, blue spring skies glistened and the street smelled like gasoline mixed with broken timber as the sounds of chain saws and heavy equipment echoed on the normally quiet street. The man's family was too upset to talk Saturday afternoon, and authorities hadn't released information about his death. Neighbors said he survived the tornado that struck Friday afternoon as it plowed through Central Arkansas by taking refuge in the bathtub while the asphalt-shingle roof was torn off the 57-year-old 1,488-square-foot masonry home. They said the man suffered a stroke after the storm. A family member who found him attempted cardiopulmonary resuscitation, but ambulances were unable to reach him in time. Officials said one person in Pulaski County, a North Little Rock resident, was killed in the storm. Deputy Coroner Matt Baldwin, said Saturday that he expected the officials to release more information Monday about the death. Sonora is a twisty street in the Park Terrace subdivision, with six houses backing up to Burns Park, running roughly parallel to Parkway Drive from West Military Drive. The worst of the damage was the section beginning about three houses south of its intersection with Sorenson Road. Piles of debris, broken tree branches and assorted trash lined the stretch of road. Of the 35 homes south of the intersection, 11 looked uninhabitable from the street, their roofs either completely or partially sheared off, with some caved in, while 27 total had serious roof damage. Houses searched by rescuers were marked with a neon orange X. Hannah and Randall King, who've lived on Sonora Drive for about three years, learned that the 1,100-square-foot house they've called home had been hit when they saw the roofless property on TV. "We literally saw it on the news," said Hannah King, a hairdresser. Salvaging what little they could from the rental home, the couple said what the winds did not take, the rains ruined. "The roof came off and everything was soaked," Randall King, a public relations professional, said, saying the couple's two cats and dog survived. The couple met with Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who walked the street with North Little Rock Mayor Terry Hartwick to see the damage. Sanders hugged the couple and posed for pictures with them and others. "She said ... if we need anything, she'll be there," Randall King said. A few houses to the north, Kimberly Long said she saw the governor and felt encouraged by her visit. "I liked that. It was special," she said. Long, with the state Department of Higher Education, said she was at work in downtown Little Rock when the storm hit, knocking a neighbor's towering backyard tree onto the rear of her home of three years, a red wood-and-brick duplex she and her husband have owned for more than 20 years. "It [the tree] looks like a big piece of broccoli," Long said. The uprooted pine struck the couple's bedroom and the room where their 9-year-old daughter sleeps, rendering the house unlivable for now. But a "miracle" spared them from much worse, Long said. Her husband, Kevin, had just picked up their daughter from school when he got an unexpected call to pick up their 2-year-old grandson in Mayflower, so they were also out of town when the disaster struck. "That was a blessing, otherwise he would have been here with my 9-year-old," Long said. "This was nothing but God." Long said she can see God's blessing after the destruction as neighbor supports neighbor and strangers bring food and water to the families trying to put their lives back together. "My prayer is that this is going to bring us together," she said, recounting how news of the disaster led to family members from across the country reaching out to check on her. The tall pecan tree in the Longs' front yard was felled by the storm, wrecking the three vehicles parked in the driveway of their next-door tenant, 36-year-old Jerimiah Turner, a DISH network technician. Turner, who's rented the property for 10 years with twin Jamal, said he was sitting in his car in the driveway when he saw the storm forming, a sudden darkness flecked with lightning. "As soon as I saw the lightning, I ran into the house," he said, saying the winds forced him to crawl into the residence. "I just balled up in the hallway." The worst of the storm was over in a couple of minutes, said Turner, who was home alone at the time. "It felt like a bomb ... three bombs with the trees," said Jared Golatt, whose 1,400-square-foot home of three years had two trees fall on it, damaging the roof. The impact blew out windows in his house, Golatt said. He said the approaching storm sounded like a rumbling train before it hit the house as he and his 60-year-old father, Johnell Golatt, took shelter. Standing in his front yard as he, his father and uncle Robert Golatt were working to get the house cleared and patched up as much as possible before more rain hit, possibly as soon as this evening, Jared Golatt said he felt he'd gotten lucky. "I fared pretty well compared to my neighbors," the correctional officer and National Guardsman said.

         100 years ago April 2, 1923 GENTRY -- The chase of the bandits who robbed the First National Bank here yesterday was abandoned late this afternoon. The posse visited the cabin of Carl Reasor, suspected of being implicated in the robbers' escape. ... Bloodhounds from Carthage, Mo., were placed on the trail at 7 o'clock this morning but after a 6-hour chase, they lost the trail at a road where the men evidently climbed into an auto. A Cadillac car was found in Reasor's barn that had been stolen a few days ago in Bartlesville from May Brothers, it is said. 50 years ago April 2, 1973 CHICAGO -- An eight-foot python emerged from under a car at Peoria recently, then went into the basement of a post office, creating panic among the postal workers. The snake, no native of Central Illinois, was just seeking some warmth. But its plight illustrated a growing phenomenon across the United States. Exotic animals and reptiles are turning up loose in society, either as escapees or as pets abandoned by disenchanted owners who can't provide the special care they require. The result is some bizarre circumstances that carry a potential for serious injury to passersby, to some regions' ecological systems and to the creatures themselves. But in recent years, experts say, affluent Americans have acquired a record number of exotic animals, such as ocelots, margays, monkeys, wallabies, hermit crabs, lions, land snails, gorillas, boa constrictors, raccoons, crickets, llamas and piranha fish. 25 years ago April 2, 1998 Moviegoers of central Arkansas, hold on to your ticket stubs. Edwards Theatres Circuit Inc. of Newport Beach, Calif., plans to build a 21-screen, 4,500-seat movie complex called The Foothills Spectrum in North Little Rock at the junction of Interstate 40 and U.S. 67-167. Preliminary plans for the $45 million to $55 million complex include the 106,000-square-foot theater, at least one hotel, several restaurants, and retail stores offering sporting apparel, movie memorabilia and the like -- and acres of parking. 10 years ago April 2, 2013 BERRYVILLE -- Berryville teachers are joining a national project focused on training teachers in rural schools on the best strategies to teach writing. "The literacy standards now with the Common Core [State Standards] mandate that all teachers teach literacy skills in their classroom," Berryville Middle School Principal Shelly Poage said. "This will help them teach writing standards more confidently and clearly." The Northwest Arkansas Writing Project, based at the University of Arkansas, is receiving $400,000 to participate in the National Writing Project College-Ready Writers Program, said Chris Goering, director of the Northwest Arkansas Writing Project.

         Principal e-mails about storm peril Nancy Rousseau, principal of Little Rock Central High School, in an email to parents and others gave a peek into the events that transpired in the school Friday afternoon as the threat of tornadoes escalated. "3/31/23 was a day we will never forget," said Rousseau, a longtime principal. "We are grateful to the Little Rock School District for NOT sending us home yesterday. "We were able to protect our students and many parents from the tornadoes that hit our city. Central was built in 1927 to last many lifetimes. We had parents/teachers/staff who were sheltering with us who left after the 'all clear' to find that they major damage if not total devastation to their homes. It is a blessing that they were here and not at their homes." Rousseau described how the school's multiple portable classrooms -- to be replaced with brick and mortar in the coming months -- were vacated early on by students and staff who were sent to the school's gym, cafeteria and auditorium for safety. "I cannot brag enough about our fabulous teachers and staff who entertained their children for 3 plus hours. And, our students were cooperative, respectful and supportive of the situation in which we found ourselves," she said. Impact of math school examined The Arkansas School for Mathematics, Sciences and the Arts in Hot Springs is an economic driver for the city and state in addition to its role in providing academic opportunities to high school students. That is the finding in a study for the residential school conducted by Boyette Strategic Advisors, a Little Rock firm that provides economic impact evaluation and analysis as well as strategic planning and other services for organizations, cities, educational institutions and other entities. Between 2017 and 2021, the school had a total impact of $104.4 million in the state of Arkansas, which is 122% above the state's base investment in the school, and $98.4 million in Garland County, more than 109% greater than the base funding, the study said. The study also concluded that the school creates a 68.4% return on investment in economic growth and development for each dollar the state invests. The state invested more than $47 million in the school during the study's five-year period. The years 2017 to 2021 "included years of growth, transformation, and even disruption for ASMSA due to the pandemic," school Director Corey Alderdice, said in response to the study. "From new facilities to the continued growth of our legislated Arts mission to further expenditures to ensure faculty and staff positions are appropriately compensated, ASMSA leveraged the people of Arkansas' investment in the potential of these students to great effect," Alderdice said. "We are grateful for the support that makes our residential and statewide outreach programs possible." The full report can be viewed at this website: asmsa.me/2023economicimpactstudy. City Year to hold Red Jacket event City Year Little Rock will host its second annual Red Jacket Luncheon on April 12 to support its efforts to help Central Arkansas students. The event will feature discussion among AmeriCorps members, moderated by Little Rock Superintendent Jermall Wright. "Instead of cocktail attire, we're inviting the community to join us for a casual, yet candid, conversation with community change-makers -- all to support local student and school success," Jennifer Cobb, senior vice president and executive director for City Year Little Rock, said. "We're excited to bring back the Red Jacket Luncheon for another year to support City Year's mission of advancing educational equity." The event will be from 11:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. at The Pavilion at Heifer Village, 1 World Ave. in Little Rock. Sponsorships, as well as individual tickets for $100, are available for purchase at secure.qgiv.com/for/ltr-arfy23springluncheon/event/863480. City Year Little Rock has been serving Central Arkansas since 2004. This year, the organization's members are full-time tutors and mentors in four Little Rock School District schools: Mabelvale Middle, Stephens Elementary, Cloverdale Middle, and J.A. Fair K-8 Preparatory School.  Print Headline: Principal e-mails about storm peril Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         BENTONVILLE -- The Bentonville City Council on Tuesday night approved a grant that will help fund the next step toward a future adult wellness center. The eight-person council voted unanimously to accept a $1.26 million grant from Bentonville Revitalization Inc. and enter into a $1.14 million agreement with Hight Jackson Associates for the design and development of the center. In June 2022, the City Council approved the adult wellness center becoming an official city project. The City Council also approved conceptual and operational plans and authorized the Parks and Recreation Department to find funding at that meeting, according to council documents. In recent weeks, the Parks and Recreation Department received a formal grant award from Bentonville Revitalization, a nonprofit organization established by members of the Walton family to support infrastructure and community projects for the long-term betterment of downtown and in support of city-driven initiatives, according to council documents. Hight Jackson was selected to lead a feasibility study for an adult wellness center, according to council documents. The agreement will retain Hight Jackson' services as the city moves to the next project phase. In that phase, Parks and Recreation Department staff will work with Hight Jackson and a construction management team to complete building and site designs and construction documents, taking the project all the way to bidding.

         A 56-year-old Little Rock man who beat his former fiancee with a hammer so severely that her brain was exposed, her vision permanently damaged and one ear torn apart was sentenced to 35 years in prison Thursday after claiming he was the true victim in the case. Henri Dubois Hatten pleaded guilty last month to first-degree domestic battery for the December 2021 attack on 51-year-old Scherice Johnson at their Howard Street home. A repeat offender who has either been on probation or parole for the past 26 years, mostly for drug and property crimes, Hatten faced a maximum of 40 years in prison at Thursday's sentencing before Circuit Judge Karen Whatley. Johnson testified that she'd known Hatten for more than 20 years but that they'd been together romantically a couple of years -- living together about six weeks -- when Hatten attacked her without provocation as she got ready for work 10 days before Christmas 2021. She told the judge Hatten had been arrested the day before -- he'd been found with a counterfeit $100 bill -- and spent a few hours in jail before being released. That morning, Johnson said Hatten came into the bathroom looking for his wallet. He left when she told him she didn't know where it was but he quickly returned to ask her for money, Johnson said. When she told him she didn't have any cash, he swung at her with a hammer they kept in the kitchen. The first blow to the head knocked her into the bathtub, she said, describing for the judge how he kept after her with the tool, hitting her in the face and head before she could flee the apartment. Hatten left in her car before police arrived, leaving the broken hammer behind, with officers finding Johnson bleeding in the street with brain matter exposed. Deputy prosecutor Justin Harper showed the judge photographs of the bloody bathroom and hammer, with the judge saying the pictures were more gruesome than some murder crime-scene photographs she'd seen. Johnson told the judge she spent the next two months in the hospital, recovering from a head wound that took 17 staples to close. Her left ear had to be sewn back together, she said. The attack damaged her vision in her left eye, leaving her with a condition that significantly increases her risk for cataracts. Johnson said she lost her home and job during the ordeal but described her survival as a blessing, saying what she wanted most was to have Hatten out of her life forever. "I'm blessed to be here," she said. "I want to go on with my life. I've got a new job and a new life." Hatten began Thursday's sentencing by trying to withdraw his guilty plea, telling the judge that his lawyers, Leslie Borgognoni and Camille Wright, had bullied him into the plea. He said he wanted to take his case to a jury so he could show that he was protecting himself from a hammer-wielding Johnson, who had attacked him because she thought he had just come home after being with another woman. Hatten said he was within his rights to protect himself from her. "The only thing I'm guilty of is trying to save my life," he testified, showing the judge what he said was a hand injury he received defending himself from the hammer. "It was my life on the line that night. My attorneys told me to plead guilty because her injuries made it look like I used too much force." Hatten said he's never abused a woman before, telling the judge he's "not a bad person. I'm not a violent person." "I've been with lots of women in my life, but, aside from Ms. Johnson, none of them can say I've hit them." Hatten cried as he described how he feared he would never be released from prison, telling the judge he suffers from recurrent throat tumors that must be regularly surgically removed. He said he didn't think he would get proper medical treatment in prison and despaired of ever being released on parole. "I don't know how long I'm going to live," he said. At one point during his 15 minutes on the witness stand, Hatten decried a criminal justice system that would send a man overseas to fight for his country but wouldn't let him defend himself at home. Asked by the judge what branch of the services Hatten had served in, he replied that he had never been in the military but his father had. Testifying on Hatten's behalf was an older sister, Robbie Arbor; her daughter, Shamicia Arbor; and the oldest of Hatten's 10 siblings, Victor Hatten. They each expressed condolences for the attack, stating that the Henri Hatten they knew was loving and caring, a man who put his family first and goes out of his way to make them laugh. The family asked for mercy. "I hope ... I'm allowed to see my brother free one day," Victor Hatten told the judge. Hatten's been plagued by drug problems for most of his life, they said, telling the judge he's never had a meaningful chance at treatment for his addictions. The judge refused to let Hatten back out of his guilty plea, pointing out that she had extensively questioned him about why he was pleading guilty and whether he was satisfied with his attorneys' advice. When she questioned him about why he was pleading last month, Hatten had assured her he was pleading guilty because he had done what he had been charged with and also, when asked, expressed satisfaction with his lawyers. The judge further noted, observing that she had specifically questioned him about whether he had been coerced into the guilty plea and he had told her he had not. Canceling his plea would also mean Hatten would stand trial for more than just the domestic battery count, the judge said, since his plea agreement involved prosecutors dropping charges of attempted first-degree murder, aggravated robbery, felony theft and terroristic threatening as well as a forgery charge involving the counterfeit money. According to police reports, officers first encountered Hatten the afternoon before the hammer attack when they stopped him for speeding, 58 mph in a 30-mph zone, driving Johnson's 2005 Mercedes on Asher Avenue. As a parolee, Hatten was searched, with officers finding the fake bill in a shoe box on the back seat. He said he'd found the box at a car wash but did not know the bill was inside. About five hours before the attack, police were called to their home when Johnson reported that Hatten had taken the Mercedes without her permission, stating he'd gotten out of jail at midnight, arrived home about 1 a.m. then left with her car a few minutes later.

         Annual Action Plan available to public North Little Rock's proposed Annual Action Plan for two programs -- Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and Home Investment Partnerships (HOME) funding -- are available for the public to review and offer comment. Members of the public can read the plan at this website -- www.nlr.ar.gov/communitydevelopment. Or they can view it in-person at the clerk's office at City Hall, 300 Main St., North Little Rock, or the city's Community Development agency at 500 W. 13th St. in North Little Rock. The public comment period for the proposed Annual Action Plan will end on April 24. A public hearing will be held during the April 24 City Council meeting, which starts at 6 p.m. at City Hall. After the public hearing, the City Council will consider whether to adopt the plan. The proposed 2023 Annual Action Plan includes annual goals and objectives for housing and community development, the projected use of 2023 program year funds, and the specific method for distributing CDBG and HOME funds, according to the Community Development Agency. The plan serves as an application for funding under these HUD programs. The purpose of the public comment period and the public hearing is to receive comments from North Little Rock residents on the strategies and priorities outlined in the plan for addressing the needs of low- and moderate-income households and neighborhoods, the Community Development agency said. Written comments may be sent to Bailey Noland, director of Community Development, at bnoland@nlr.ar.gov or 500 West 13th Street, North Little Rock. Citizens may also contact Noland at (501) 340-5342 (dial 711 for Arkansas Relay). Comments will be considered prior to the City Council's adoption of the plan. A summary of comments received will be attached to the plan prior to its submission to HUD. Winrock plans to upgrade Hub Winrock International will upgrade the Arkansas Regional Innovation Hub's property to include new office space to accommodate both Winrock and Hub staff while enhancing program offerings and member services. In 2021, Winrock and the Hub announced plans for a full merger, including expanded collaboration, renovation and upgrades of the Hub's property at 204 E. Fourth St. in North Little Rock. Plans include the addition of new office space to accommodate staff from Winrock's U.S. and international programs as well as existing Hub staff. The transition will require the Hub's 22,000-square-foot facility in North Little Rock to undergo internal remodeling beginning in June. The Hub will reopen in November. The construction phase will not affect the Hub's work. Adult and youth education programming will still be available through the Hub's Mobile Makerspace program and through community partnerships. The newly remodeled building will include the first Best Buy Teen Tech Center in Arkansas and the first solar canopy in downtown North Little Rock, which will bring solar energy to the Hub. Program for kids with disabilities Laman Library has announced a partnership with Special Olympics Arkansas to provide the Young Athletes program for children with intellectual disabilities ages 2-7. The program focuses on developing essential mental and physical skills through fun and interactive play, with significant gains reported in motor skills and other areas of development. As part of the Young Athletes program, Laman Library has received two specially designed kits -- foam balls, yarn balls, rubber spots, plastic cones, bean bags, scarves and reading materials for children and parents. The kits also feature a set of activity flashcards that can lead families through a day of play, with all activities accessible to both children with and without intellectual disabilities. To give families a chance to try out the kits and learn more about the program, Laman Library will host a Showcase of Young Athlete Kits from 10 a.m. to noon on Saturday. The kits will be on display. Families can participate in the provided activities while asking questions they might have about the program. More information about the Young Athletes program is available at https://bit.ly/3nB8C4C. Questions about the Showcase of Young Athlete Kits or the program in general are available from Connor Brasher at connor.brasher@lamanlibrary.org. More information about the program is available by contacting the North Little Rock Public Library System at (501) 758-1720 or going to the website www.NLRlibrary.org.
