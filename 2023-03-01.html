        The National Weather Service has issued a flash-flood warning for Arkadelphia, Malvern and White Hall until 11:20 p.m. Wednesday, one of a string of alerts issued throughout the evening. The agency had previously issued a flash-flood warning for Mena, Wickes, and Hatfield until 9:15 p.m. Wednesday. — Arkansas Democrat-Gazette 6:30 p.m.: The National Weather Service has issued a severe thunderstorm warning for Hot Springs, Hot Springs Village and Piney until 7 p.m. Wednesday, even as the tornado warning for the same three cities expired a half-hour earlier than originally projected. The thunderstorm warning for those cities included the possibility of hail the size of ping-pong balls. Alerts were also issued for Stuttgart, Clarendon and Hazen until 7 p.m. Wednesday, including 40 mph winds and half-inch sized hail. A separate warning for Alpine, Murfreesboro and Amity until 6:45 p.m. Wednesday included 50 mph winds and penny-sized hail. Alpine and Murfreesboro were also under a severe thunderstorm warning issued at 6:26 p.m. Wednesday. That warning, which also includes Glenwood, was set to expire at 7:15 p.m. Wednesday and includes a chance of 60 mph winds and quarter-sized hail. — Daniel McFadin 6:12 p.m.: The National Weather Service issued a tornado warning for Hot Springs, Hot Springs Village and Piney until 6:45 p.m. Wednesday. The alert affects an area that includes roughly 107,000 people. — Daniel McFadin 5:47 p.m.: The National Weather Service has issued a flash flood warning for Mena, Wickes, and Hatfield until 9:15 p.m. It also issued a severe thunderstorm warning for Mount Ida, Norman and Black Springs until 6:15 p.m. That alert affects around 7,319 people. — Daniel McFadin 4:59 p.m.: Around 4:30 p.m. Wednesday, the National Weather issued a severe thunderstorm warning for Hazen, De Valls Bluff and Humnoke until 5:15 p.m. The alert warns of 60 mph wind and quarter-sized hail. Roughly 5,138 people fall under the warning. Just after 4:50 p.m., the NWS also issued a severe thunderstorm warning for Hatfield, Cove and Vandervoort lasting until 5:45 p.m. The alert covers a population of roughly 5,657 and two schools. — Daniel McFadin 3:38 p.m.: Tornado watch issued for southern two-thirds of Arkansas Just after 3:30 p.m. Wednesday, the National Weather Service in North Little Rock issued a tornado watch for 23 Arkansas counties until 10 p.m. The counties are Arkansas, Bradley, Clark, Cleveland, Dallas, Desha, Drew, Faulkner, Garland, Hot Spring, Jefferson, Lincoln, Lonoke, Monroe, Montgomery, Nevada, Ouachita, Perry, Pike, Prairie, Pulaski, Saline and White. The watch also covers parts of Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas. Once storms develop, initial discrete cells will be capable of large hail. Any cells that can become surface based near the Arkansas-Louisiana border will support some risk for tornadoes, given adequate low-level wind shear. As the low level windjet gradually strengthens in the late afternoon and evening, elongating shear profiles and increasing shear should support a greater risk for tornadoes, according to the National Weather Service. — Daniel McFadin 1:42 p.m.: Forecasters: Storms bring chance for baseball-sized hail, tornadoes in Arkansas The risk for severe weather on Wednesday and Thursday has increased across portions of Arkansas, bringing chances for baseball-sized hail and tornadoes, according to the National Weather Service. Strong to severe storms are expected to develop throughout the afternoon and evening on Wednesday, a briefing from the weather service states. A flood watch for nearly all but the southern third of the state will go into place during the afternoon. “An enhanced risk for severe thunderstorms has been introduced across much of central and southern portions of the state,” the weather service said in a tweet on Wednesday morning.  An enhanced risk of severe weather means that forecasters have “high confidence that several storms will contain damaging winds, severe hail, and/or tornado potential,” a briefing from the weather service said Wednesday. Parts of central, southwest and eastern Arkansas are included in an enhanced risk for severe weather on Wednesday, according to forecasters.  The tornado potential for Wednesday increased from very low to low on Tuesday. Storms on Wednesday now have the potential to produce baseball sized hail and winds up to 60 mph, the weather service in North Little Rock said. “Widespread heavy rainfall and antecedent saturated soil surfaces will pose an elevated threat for flash flooding across most of the northern half of the state over the next few days,” the briefing said.  Parts of west and southwestern Arkansas will start seeing storms midafternoon on Wednesday, according to the briefing. Storms will be in central, northern, northwestern and southern portions of the state by late afternoon and early evening. Northeast Arkansas is expected to see rain in the evening and early hours overnight.  Due to the rain, a flood watch will take effect Wednesday afternoon and continue through Friday morning, according to forecasters.  The storms on Wednesday are “just a precursor to the main severe weather event on Thursday,” the briefing said.  A regional outbreak of severe weather, including the possibility for strong and violent tornadoes, appears likely for Thursday, forecasters said.  “A concerning amount of instability and wind energy will fuel more numerous severe storms on Thursday and Thursday night,” the briefing said.  Forecasters are predicting that storms on Thursday will have a high potential for tornadoes, hail as big as a baseball and wind speeds exceeding 80 mph, according to the briefing.  Southwestern and southern parts of the state have now increased to a moderate risk of severe weather for Thursday, forecasters said.  A moderate risk is defined by forecasters as having “a high confidence that many storms will contain damaging winds, severe hail, and/or tornadoes,” according to the weather briefing. Storms associated with this risk are intense and an area may only experience them once a year or less. The KLZK radar is back in service after it went offline Monday night, the weather service in North Little Rock announced in a separate Twitter post just before 1:30 p.m. on Wednesday. Dennis Cavanaugh, a meteorologist with the weather service, said earlier Wednesday afternoon before the tweet that technicians were installing replacement parts and testing the radar. He said the weather service in North Little Rock was still ready to provide the same service the public has come to expect, even if the radar remained offline. “If the only tool we had were the back-up radars, it would likely degrade our services, but those are not all we have,” Cavanaugh said. While forecasters have already pulled up back-up radars to track the storms expected on Wednesday, the weather service also uses information from storm spotters, community partnerships and satellites. — Remington Miller Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        If the Arkansas Supreme Court grants the states motion to dismiss an appeal for new DNA testing in the West Memphis Three case, the request will be filed again in a different county, attorneys for Damien Echols wrote in an Arkansas Supreme Court filing on Wednesday. “Granting of the States motion effects nothing but delay into the processing of Echols petition,” according to his attorneys. Citing a boxing maneuver meant to tire out opponents, they wrote, “The Court should decline to endorse this ‘rope-a-dope strategy by the State.” The issue involves jurisdiction. Echols, along with Jason Baldwin and Jessie Misskelley, were convicted in 1994 of the slayings of three 8-year-old boys — Christopher Byers, Steve Branch and Michael Moore — whose bodies were found in a drainage ditch near West Memphis the previous year. Echols was sentenced to death. The homicides occurred in Crittenden County, but Echols received a change of venue to Craighead County, where he was tried and convicted. No DNA evidence ever linked the three to the deaths, and they were released from prison in 2011 after prosecutors allowed them to walk free as part of a deal known as an Alford plea, which was also entered in Craighead County Circuit Court. An Alford plea is a guilty plea in criminal court. By taking an Alford plea, a defendant does not admit to the criminal act and asserts their innocence, but agrees that the evidence presented by the prosecution would be likely to persuade a judge or jury to find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Since then, the defendants have been trying to clear their names. Attorneys representing Echols petitioned Crittenden County Circuit Court on Jan. 24, 2022, to permit new M-Vac wet-vacuum DNA testing on sneaker laces that were used to hogtie the three boys. This type of DNA testing wasnt available when previous DNA tests were done on evidence from the crime scene, according to the court filing. Crittenden County Circuit Judge Tonya Alexander denied Echols request in June, stating that he wasnt entitled to the evidence examination because the law only allows incarcerated convicts the opportunity to seek new evidence testing. Echols appealed the decision to the Arkansas Supreme Court. On Feb. 21, Assistant Attorney General Brooke Jackson Gasaway filed a motion saying Echols appeal should be dismissed because he filed his initial request in the wrong county. “Echols is appealing the Crittenden County Circuit Courts denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus under Act 1780 of 2001,” wrote Gasaway. “His conviction, however, was entered in the Craighead County Circuit Court in case number CR-93-540A. “Under Ark. Code Ann. § 16-112-201(a) (Repl. 2016), an Act 1780 habeas petition must be filed in the circuit court where the judgment of ‘conviction was entered. Because Echols filed his petition in the wrong county, this court should dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.” But Echols attorneys — John R. Elrod of Fayetteville, Patrick J. Benca of Little Rock and Stephen L. Braga of Washington, D.C. — say thats irrelevant. According to Wednesday's filing, both Crittenden and Craighead counties are in Arkansas 2nd Judicial Circuit. They cite a 2020 case, Williams v. State, in which the Arkansas Supreme Court confronted a situation where a defendant “alleged that a jurisdictional violation occurred because he entered his plea in Desha County and not in Chicot County, where the crime was committed and the judgment was entered.” Desha and Chicot counties are both in Arkansas 10th Judicial Circuit. The Supreme Court found that this “present[ed] issues of local jurisdiction,” rather than “subject matter jurisdiction,” according to Echols filing. Circuit judges have “the authority to preside over proceedings in any courtroom, in any county, within the judicial district for which that judge was elected.” The parties cant waive a courts lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, according to Echols attorneys. They note that Prosecuting Attorney Keith L. Chrestman agreed to waive venue for the purpose of the circuit court hearing before Judge Alexander in Crittenden County in June. “[V]enue and jurisdiction, though sometimes used interchangeably, are two distinct legal concepts,” Echols attorneys wrote, citing a 1994 case, Davis v. Reed. “Venue is the geographic area, like a county, where an action is brought to trail. Jurisdiction is the power of a court to decide cases and presupposes the control over the subject matter and parties.” Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        Beginning this fall, the Pine Bluff School District will operate just one high school and one junior high school “in order to be good fiscal agents,” Superintendent Jennifer Barbaree announced in a video released Wednesday, a little less than two years after Dollarway schools officially became part of the district. Barbaree announced her “intention” to close Jack Robey Junior High School and to have all seventh-, eighth- and ninth-grade students attend the present Robert F. Morehead Middle School campus, adding that the present Dollarway High School could be used to hold some of the students. Meanwhile, all 10th-, 11th- and 12th-grade students will attend Pine Bluff High School. Barbaree said in the video that she met with each campus principal and visited all nine district campuses to inform faculty and staff of the upcoming changes, making good on a statement she made after a school board work session last Thursday when she publicly indicated that the district cannot financially support so many campuses. Officials said the decisions announced Wednesday were required in order for the district to leave state control.  “I want to be clear that the main reason for closing Jack Robey is for financial reasons,” Barbaree told The Commercial. “We received a quote for a new HVAC system, and we would use ESSER [Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief] funding, but if we put in a new HVAC system, wed have to replace the roof. The quote for that is $12 [million] to $13 million.” Jack Robey, located on South Olive Street, opened in 1986 as Pine Bluff Junior High School and was renamed in honor of the late Pine Bluff School District superintendent the following year. Morehead, located on Fluker Avenue, was renovated from the old Townsend Park Elementary in 1999 after a 1997 fire damaged the old campus. Dollarway High was renovated from the old Dollarway Junior High School in 2009. It was named after Morehead, a board member in the Dollarway School District, in 2010, then was converted to Dollarway High in 2016 after the Dollarway School District was forced to close the old campus on Dollarway Road. The Morehead and Dollarway High campuses are newer, more conducive to learning and dont cost as much to maintain as Jack Robey, Barbaree explained. The superintendent added that merging the Dollarway and Pine Bluff High student bodies was best for the students, based on finances and the classroom experience. Pine Bluff High currently enrolls 583 students in grades 10-12, and Dollarway High enrolls 163 in the same grades. All high school and junior high athletic teams and activity clubs will be known as the Pine Bluff Zebras, Barbaree said. “We cannot afford to function as two high schools,” Barbaree said. “We have a little over 100 students at Dollarway High, and we cant staff that when we have another high school that can take those students in. Its not fair to the teams at Dollarway struggling to get participation up in sports and other activities. They dont have the facilities and such things that Pine Bluff High has.” Geographically, the entire Pine Bluff School District will be represented with the mergers, Barbaree said. STAFFING Some staff members will be reassigned and some positions will be eliminated as a result of the mergers, Barbaree revealed in the video. “It is not my intention to do a RIF,” she said, referring to a reduction-in-force. “However, I will recommend to the school board … to non-renew our faculty that are non-licensed. I know we are going to need some of our non-licensed employees, so some of those decisions will be made as soon as possible as far as hiring back, based on student needs.” BUILDINGS Barbaree reiterated the districts plan to build a new campus, clarifying that a location has not yet been determined. Public sentiment, however, has favored a rebuild of the present Pine Bluff High School at 711 W. 11th Ave. Barbaree said that most of the buildings at Pine Bluff High School must be demolished, regardless where the district decides to construct a new campus. This is because the cost-share agreement with the Arkansas Department of Education to construct a new high school is based on a space replacement. It is possible that the Pine Bluff School District's elementary schools will be reconfigured, Barbaree added. Presently prekindergarten students attend Forrest Park/Greenville Preschool, and children in grades kindergarten through six attend Broadmoor, James Matthews, Southwood and 34th Avenue elementaries.

        The House Education Committee forwarded Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders education overhaul Wednesday, sending the bill to the House of Representatives floor for a vote. The committee approved the bill on a voice vote, and it will head to the House floor Thursday for a vote, House Speaker Matthew Shepherd said. The committees vote comes after seven hours of public testimony Tuesday with 94 members of the public signing up to speak for and against the bill during the hearing. “Ultimately when you look at the bill in its entirety, what we all want is to finally do something that will take our state from the bottom of the rankings, where we are year after year, and deliver something big and bold for Arkansas and for the students,” said Rep. Grant Hodges, R-Centerton. The bill passed the Senate last week. If approved by the House, it will have to move back to the Senate for a concurring vote before it is sent to Sanders for action. Senate Bill 294, also known as the LEARNS Act, is Sanders education reform bill. The Republican govern has described it as her top legislative priority since taking office in January. The 144-page bill is an omnibus package that Sanders said is “the most bold, comprehensive, conservative education reform package in the nation.” The bill includes a phased-in voucher program that will give students 90% of foundation funding to attend a private or home school. The bill also calls for a $14,000 increase in the starting salary for teachers and funding for literacy coaches to boost reading levels for elementary students. Rep. Denise Garner, D-Fayetteville, took issue with the bills voucher program, saying studies have shown they do not work “Vouchers do not support students with disabilities and it does exasperate segregation, skirt accountability and transparency, funds discrimination and leaves underserved students and communities behind,” Garner said. CORRECTION: Denise Garner is a Democratic state representative from Fayetteville. An earlier version of this story incorrectly identified her party affiliation.

        A 19-year-old man was taken to a hospital after being stabbed in an off-road park on Sunday, authorities said.  The victim was stabbed around 1:30 a.m. on Sunday in Carter Off-Road Park, 7498 Anderson St., on the county line between Pulaski and Saline counties, a news release from the Pulaski County sheriffs office said Sunday.  He was said to be “in serious condition,” according to the release.  Lt. Cody Burk, a spokesman for the sheriffs office, said the victim was released from the hospital as of Wednesday afternoon. The sheriffs office said Memphis Ketelsen, a suspect in the stabbing, was located and arrested by Bryant police on unrelated charges, according to the release.  An online roster for the Saline County jail showed that Ketelsen, 19, of Alexander, had been released at 4:15 p.m.  on Monday. It also showed he had a $10,000 bond.  The roster also showed that Ketelsen had been charged with resisting arrest, second-degree criminal mischief, first-degree terroristic threatening and two counts of second-degree battery on a law enforcement officer.  Burk said Wednesday that the Pulaski County sheriffs office investigation into the stabbing was still ongoing.  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        Aspiring country pop artist Marybeth Byrd times her auditions around graduations.  Byrd, 21, first auditioned for singing competition show “The Voice” in 2019, the same year she graduated from Armorel High School.  She made it to the Top 8 while competing on John Legends team during season 17 of the show.  Now Byrd, set to graduate from Arkansas State University in the spring, will be auditioning in front of celebrity judges on Sundays “American Idol.” Byrd, a strategic communications major at ASU, said she has always loved music.  “I am an artist of many layers. I sound country but sometimes I sing pop,” said Byrd, “I love my falsetto, my head voice, thats considered pop. Country is the base of everything for me, so country pop.”  She said that gospel and southern influences are really shown in her music.  Byrd, who has not seen her episode yet, will be seen on TVs across the country auditioning in front of Katy Perry, Lionel Richie and Luke Bryan along with her guitarist Charles Moody, who she brought from home.  She said she will probably just stay in and watch the episode in her bed with her dog, but she received word from her family about watch parties.  “I am really blessed to have grown up in a small town because you know everyone,” Byrd said Tuesday, “And it just feels like one big family.”  Byrd said shes always lived in Armorel, an unincorporated community in Mississippi County, with a population of just over 300 people.  Her childhood consisted of a lot of four-wheeler riding and family time, she said. “My grandparents helped raise me, you know being in a southern family youre just always so close,” the singer said.  “Folsom Prison Blues” by Johnny Cash is the song that she says always reminds her of growing up in the state.  “Our house was always the ‘neighborhood house where my brother would have all of his friends and people would come over just to have dinners all the time,” Byrd said, “It was just southern hospitality at its finest.”  Byrd said she hopes to keep building relationships with other artists through “American Idol,” something she's learned after reflecting on her time as a contestant on “The Voice.”  “On top of being a 17-year-old doing something that big and not really knowing who I was as an artist or as a person, I also lost my grandpa, someone who was really important to me, in the midst of that,” Byrd said, “It was all of these different things in one that I wasnt ready for.”  She said that now, four years later, shes started finding herself though growing up and welcoming adulthood.  She said she's matured in the four years since "The Voice," and has started finding herself as she welcomes adulthood.  “I feel like ‘American Idol is what Ive been waiting on. I feel like its a stepping stone towards my future,” Byrd said, “I am over the moon about the whole thing." Byrd said that while it is easy to get lost in friendships shes built with others auditioning, including Holly Groves Lucy Love, shes reminding herself that shes auditioning to start a career.  “The whole winning thing kind of gets shoved to the back of your mind, for me,” She said, “Its just been so fun getting to watch all of my friends perform and do their thing." Byrd said it means a lot to her to get to represent Arkansas while auditioning.  “I wouldnt want to live in any other state, though I hope Nashville is in my future” she said, “Arkansas is where my heart is. I have a love for this place like no other.” Byrd said she wants to inspire young girls who have also grown up in small towns. “I think artists who grew up in small towns can feel out of their element when they love music, because there arent as many opportunities here compared to Nashville or Los Angeles,” the singer said, “I want to tell them that they can do it, too.”  “Success is not an overnight thing," Byrd said. "Even when there is pressure to be the next best thing tomorrow, take one step at a time.”  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        The body of a man found Feb. 20 in a Jonesboro pond has been identified, police said Monday. Felipe Morales Nava, 45, was identified by the state Crime Laboratory on Friday by using “fingerprint analysis,” Jonesboro police said on Facebook. The Crime Lab noted that there were “no obvious signs of injuries or foul play,” the Facebook post said.  “This death will be ruled as an apparent drowning,” the post said. Nava was found on Feb. 20 by a resident who then called the Jonesboro Police Department, according to the post. The body was found in the 900 block of East Lakeshore Drive, just south of East Matthews Avenue and about a mile southwest of the Arkansas State University campus. Officers did not find a way to identify the body at that time, so it was transported to the Crime Lab for an autopsy and identification, police said.  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        ARKADELPHIA — Ninth West Judicial District Prosecutor Jana Bradford has been named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit involving her uncle, a convicted child sex offender. Bradford, of Glenwood, is one of six individuals named in the lawsuit's amended complaint, along with two businesses owned by her uncle Barry Alan Walker, 58. The complaint is 164 pages long and claims Bradford and other family members "circled the wagons" to defend Barry Walker and keep his businesses operating. The lawsuit was filed in Clark County circuit court. It claims Bradford was a deputy prosecuting attorney in the Ninth West Judicial District of Arkansas at the time of the crimes and was a mandated reporter of child maltreatment under Arkansas code 12-18-402. The plaintiffs are represented by Texarkana-based Mercy Carter Law Firm. Bradford is being sued in her individual capacity only and is not being sued in her capacity as a deputy prosecuting attorney or as the current elected prosecutor of the Ninth West Judicial District, according to the lawsuit. Bradford was elected in May 2022 and began her four-year term in January. Walker was a physician until his license was suspended in 1999 after a conviction for sexual misconduct with a child in Fort Smith. The lawsuit claims Bradford and the other defendants were aware Walker was a registered sex offender and also knew Walker was at a risk of harming other prepubescent females if he did not continue his medical care, therapy and counseling. The lawsuit also states the defendants knew Walker needed to avoid high-risk behaviors such as drinking alcohol and high-risk situations such as being alone with young females. According to the lawsuit, the defendants knew Walker had stopped receiving psychotherapy, was drinking alcohol and socializing with young girls. The family members would not allow their own daughters be alone with Barry Walker but "neither took steps to protect other prepubescent females from Barry Walker" according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit also claims Bradford made attempts to have Walker removed from the sex offender registry in 2018. In October 2022, Walker pleaded guilty to numerous counts of rape of a minor, computer exploitation of a child, producing and other sexual crimes involving children and was given 18 life sentences without parole in Pike County and 21 in Clark County. Walker had been held in the Pike County Detention Center since June 2022 when multiple charges were brought against him after a search of his home. Police found evidence that led to accusations that Walker assaulted 31 children in 34 separate incidents, according to reports. Bradford could not be reached for comment.

        An El Dorado man has been charged with rape, kidnapping, first-degree criminal mischief, interference with emergency communications, third-degree domestic battery and endangering the welfare of a minor following the attack and sexual assault of a Camden woman he had previously been in a relationship with. Chance Rogers, 29, was released on a $100,000 bond from Judge Ryan Phillips on Jan. 23. According to an affidavit from the Camden Police Department, on Jan. 23, officers responded to the Ouachita County Medical Center in reference to a sexual assault. The victim in the case told police Rogers drove to her home, where she lives with her young child, and attacked her, choking her in her bedroom before violently sexually assaulting her, according to the affidavit. She alleged that after the assault, she escaped the bedroom and hid in her car, where Rogers, she said, continued to harass her, including by ripping the handle off her vehicle and trying to puncture her tires. Rogers then brought her child out of the house to force her to exit the vehicle, she claimed. When she followed them inside her house, Rogers dragged her around by her hair and punched her repeatedly in the stomach and genitals, she told police. The victim reported punching Rogers in the face and scratching his neck in self-defense. After Rogers left her home, the woman reportedly went to Ouachita County Medical Center where police saw that her left elbow was bruised, right hand was swollen and she had bruises on her left thigh. Carpet burn was also indicated on her buttocks, according to police. The affidavit states that when Rogers was arrested he did not want to give a statement because "women are always the victim." The report notes that Rogers had injuries consistent with the victim's statement. According to court records, Rogers was previously convicted in 2019 of terroristic threatening. He was sentenced to five years probation in that case. Print Headline: Local man charged with rape, kidnapping Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        Members of the public had their second chance weigh in on Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders' education overhaul during a marathon meeting Tuesday as the bill continues to make its way through the state Legislature. The House Committee on Education took no action on the bill, with chair Brian Evans, R-Cabot, saying he wanted to give members time to mull over public comments before a scheduled debate and vote today. Tuesday's meeting began at 9 a.m. before breaking for approximately two-and-a-half hours, resuming and ultimately finishing up shortly after 9 p.m. [LIVE VIDEO: House Education Committee to meet at 2:45 p.m. » arkansasonline.com/31panel/] The bill, which calls for a phased-in voucher program that will provide 90% of per-student state foundation funding for students to attend a private or home school, has become an object of contentious debate that has drawn criticism from teachers and praise from school choice activists. The bill also calls for a $14,000 raise in the starting salary for Arkansas teachers, which would boost the state's minimum pay for educators to among the highest in the nation. Last week the Senate approved Senate Bill 294, also known as the Arkansas LEARNS Act, and if approved by the House the legislation would have to move back to the Senate for a concurring vote before heading to Sanders for action. The bill's House sponsor, Rep. Keith Brooks, R-Little Rock, presented the bill in front of a packed hearing room inside one of the Legislature's largest meeting rooms at the multi-agency complex, also known as Big MAC. In total, 94 people signed up to testify for and against the bill Tuesday, with police asking some people to leave the hearing room because it was well beyond capacity. Members of the public took turns for about eight hours giving lawmakers their thoughts on the bill. "This bold vision that Gov. Sanders has put forward in partnership with the General Assembly represents the most aggressive and focused education package in the history of our great state and likely the nation," Brooks said. "Arkansas LEARNS is our call to arms." VOUCHERS Sanders' education bill calls for a voucher program, called Educational Freedom Accounts, which will provide students with 90% of foundation funding from the prior school year. For the 2022-2023 school year the foundation per student was $7,413. The voucher program will be phased in over three years, beginning with the 2023-2024 school year. The program will be open first to students in F-rated schools enrolled in kindergarten who were or are in a foster care program, have a disability or have an active-duty military parent. For the 2024-2025 school year, the voucher program will expand to students attending a D-rated school; who have a parent who is a military veteran; or who are children of first responders. By the 2025-2026 school year, every student who is eligible to enroll in a public school will be eligible for a voucher to attend a private or home school. The bill's school vouchers were the most debated issue during Tuesday's hearing, with critics arguing the vouchers would effectively defund public schools, while proponents said the Educational Freedom Accounts would tie public dollars to students instead of to schools. "Instead of taking all of this additional money and putting it into vouchers and transportation, competitive grants and all of these things, let's put it in folks' school," said Deanna Klaus, a seventh-grade math teacher. "Public tax dollars belong in the public schools where we can educate all of our students." Many of the parents who spoke in favor of the bill said they had children with special needs who need intensive care that many public schools could not offer. Cassandra Bone spoke in favor of the legislation, saying public schools generally aren't equipped to serve students with special needs. Bone said her child was able to attend Compass Academy in Conway, a private, non-profit school for children with developmental disabilities, thanks to a scholarship. "My child, who was barely speaking, is doing multiplication," she said. "Every child should have the opportunity if they don't fit the mold." The voucher program would cost the state $46.7 million in the first year and $97.5 million in the second, according to an analysis from the state Department of Education. The analysis estimates 7,000 students in the first year and 14,000 in the second year will take advantage of the voucher program. In the third year, when every student in the state would be eligible for vouchers, public funding will be prorated on a per-need basis. "I know that we say that school choice is an option, but we have no schools that are A or B schools in our area," said Jessie McGruder, an educator from West Memphis. Kevin Tipton, a member of the Cabot School Board, said the bill had a lot of benefits, including expansion of pre-kindergarten education, grants for tutors and literacy coaches to help students who are not reading at-grade level. He also said he was pleased with the bill's increased starting pay for teachers and the bill's "dual track" diploma, which would allow high school students to focus their education on a skill or trade. Tipton summed up his support for the bill by quoting a question from his grandfathers, who he said he considered his "political talking buddies." "Each of them would ask me: Does the good that this creates outweigh the concerns? The answer to that is yes," Tipton said. Heath Bennett, superintendent of Haskell Harmony Grove School, opposed the bill and questioned how state officials would find the funding to cover its provisions. Bennett said the bill's voucher program would do little to help students in his district, some of whom take more than two-hour bus rides to school. "It's very disheartening to listen to how public schools fail all the time," he said. "If you look at my ACT scores, you may wonder how I'm a superintendent. I was very blessed to have people who believed in me a long time ago. That's what public schools do." Amanda Escue, an administrator at Lighthouse, a home school cooperative in northeast Arkansas, echoed a refrain many in favor of the bill mentioned, that public schools do not work for all students. "The current model is not successful for all children, and I speak specifically about special learning," she said. TEACHER SALARIES Under the bill, starting salaries for teachers would increase from $36,000 to $50,000 a year, which would place Arkansas fourth in the nation for starting teacher pay, according to the National Education Association, the largest teacher union in the country. Additionally, each teacher will receive a $2,000 raise and could earn up to $10,000 in bonus pay for high test scores or teaching in a geographic or subject area of high need. Most who testified Tuesday said they favored the increase in starting pay for teachers, noting that with Arkansas' relatively low cost of living it would make the state an attractive landing spot for new educators. The new starting salaries also would mean a change to the state's complicated pay schedule for teachers, which rewards educators for experience and education. The bill would require school districts to adopt their own pay schedules, Brooks said. Administrators from smaller school districts worried whether they could afford the increase in starting pay. The bill would set aside state funding for increased teacher pay, requiring schools to pay teachers at least 80% of what the state recommends they do as a part of its funding formula for schools, also known as the matrix. "I do see this as causing great stress on my small schools," said Rep. DeAnn Vaught, R-Horatio. THE PROCESS The idea that lawmakers are hastily pushing through Sanders' education package is one of the main criticisms the bill's sponsors have received since introducing the legislation Feb. 20. Brooks and Senate sponsor Breanne Davis, R-Russellville, filed the bill last Monday. About 40 hours later the Senate Education Committee held a public hearing on the bill, with the Senate debating and voting on the bill Thursday. "Sen. Davis and I -- and others -- joined Gov. Sanders in the Delta over a month ago to listen to educators and administrators about their real world challenges and how they would best address those needs," Brooks said. "And so, the reality is that Arkansas LEARNS is not some sort of haphazardly created blueprint that was written one day and filed the next." Some complained, however, including some Republican lawmakers, that the public was not given enough time to thoroughly read the 144-page bill. "There's not one superintendent in my local area that had any boots on the ground from a member of this body or the Senate or got a call as this was being put together," said William Roundtree, superintendent of Carlisle Public Schools. OTHER COMMENTS The bill also calls for the repeal of the Teacher Fair Dismissal Act, the state law that requires educators be given written notice before being fired. Brooks said an amendment that he filed Friday would add back in some due protections for teachers to have a hearing before being fired. He said the repeal of the law would allow school districts to fire poor-performing teachers. Rep. Steven Walker, R-Horseshoe Bend, asked how the school would evaluate "non-testing" teachers such as physical education and music teachers. State Education Secretary Jacob Oliva said each school district will come up with ways to evaluate "non-testing" school districts. Rep. Ron McNair, R-Harrison, asked what input the public would have in the rule-making authority the legislation prescribes for the Department of Education, saying it seems that only after the bill's passage would bureaucrats and lawmakers determine how the bill will work. Brooks said the public will be a part of the rule-making process.   Gallery: Arkansas General Assembly - 2/28/23  Print Headline: Public weighs in on LEARNS Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        Law enforcement agencies this week announced arrests in two fatal hit-and-run accidents in Central Arkansas. In a news release Monday, the Arkansas State Police said Candace Conners, 72, of Sherwood had been arrested on a charge of leaving the scene of an accident involving physical injury or death, a felony, in the collision that killed Lawrence “Gage” Gates, 22, of Jacksonville. Gates was found dead on the morning of Sept. 2, 2022, in a yard next to Arkansas 107 near West Cleveland Road in Pulaski County, police said. He had last been seen by his mother around 3 p.m. on the day before. During the course of the investigation, investigators determined that Gates was struck by a 2014 Jeep Cherokee Trail Hawk that was found in Cabot and had DNA matching Connors, police said. Conners surrendered at Pulaski County District court on Feb. 17 and entered an innocent plea. Also on Monday, Benton police announced that Jerrica Speed, 28, of Hot Springs had been arrested in connection with a Jan. 15 hit-and-run that killed 13-year-old Zarious Evans of Benton. Evans was found dead in the 19000 block of South Service Road just before 7 a.m. on Jan. 15, after police received a call about an unresponsive boy in the area. A Jan. 17 police news release identified Speed as the driver of the black Nissan Pathfinder involved in the crash and said she had contacted authorities about it. Speed faces charges of leaving the scene of an accident involving death or serious injury, negligent homicide and obstructing governmental operations, police said. Authorities said three minors are also facing curfew violations and other misdemeanor charges related to the hit-and-run. The identity of the minors and information about the other charges were not immediately released. Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         SPRINGDALE --A Springdale Police officer shot a man in the head Wednesday morning after he pointed a gun at him, according to a release from Capt. Jeff Taylor. The department received a call around 12:50 a.m., Wednesday saying a female had been shot on Eicher Avenue in Springdale. When officers arrived, they found Argentina Agee, 31, shot in the arm, according to the news release. Officers were told that the suspect was in a blue Chevy Tahoe, which they found nearby in the driveway of 1115 Eicher Avenue, the release states. Eicher Avenue is about two blocks from Murphy Park. Officers found a 17-year-old male lying under a blanket in the back seat. An officer opened the rear passenger door and told the suspect to show his hands, according to the the release. The man then began to sit up and as he did, he pointed a pistol at the officer who then fired, hitting the suspect in the head, according to the news release. The identity of the suspect is not being released at this time other than he is a 17-year-old male, the release states. Officers began providing first aid to the male and Agee until paramedics arrived on the scene. Both the male and Agee were taken to local hospitals for their injuries, according to the release. The investigation of use of deadly force by the officer as well as the shooting of the female victim is being handled by the Washington County Sheriff's Office. The officer has been placed on paid administrative leave, which is standard protocol pending the Washington County Sheriff's investigation as well as an internal investigation, the release states. This is the second time in the last two weeks an officer has fired his weapon at a suspect near Murphy Park. Police received a call about 6 p.m. Feb. 15 from a woman saying Ethan Brasel, 20, would not get out of her car in the western parking lot of Murphy Park on South Pleasant Street, according to a department news release. The caller reported Brasel had a pistol in his front waistband and there was another gun in the car, police said. Officers said they found Brasel sitting in the front passenger seat of a white car. Officers ordered Brasel out of the car and asked if he had any weapons, the release says. Brasel said he didn't have a weapon, but officers could see a rifle in the front passenger seat of the vehicle, the release says. Brasel ran when one of the officers began to pat him down in a search for weapons, police said. An officer yelled Brasel had a gun as police chased him west from the park, police said. An officer ordered Brasel to drop the gun, according to the release. An officer then fired his gun at Brasel, but didn't hit him, the release said.

        Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed an executive order Tuesday requiring state officials and a newly formed coalition to draft policies addressing faults in Arkansas' foster care system. The order tasks state department heads and Every Child Arkansas -- a network of non-profits, faith-based organizations and private placement agencies -- with finding ways to recruit more foster care parents, connect families with social services and create preventive strategies to keep children out of foster care, Sanders said during a news conference. "This executive order will have a major direct impact on the foster care system here in Arkansas," she said. "It's just the first of many steps we're planning to take." By cutting processing times and speeding foster family licensing, Sanders said she expects the initiative to place children in homes in less than two months. The program also aims to increase the transparency of the foster care system and deputize a foster advocate to help foster families in each county, Sanders said. Roughly 4,100 children were in foster care in Arkansas as of January, according to the state Department of Human Services. Lawmakers, advocates and foster families crowded the governor's conference room to watch Sanders and other officials affiliated with Every Child Arkansas deliver remarks. Before Sanders signed her order, Dr. Phil Goad, chair of the executive leadership council for Every Child Arkansas, announced the official launch of the foster care network's website. "It will raise awareness of the need for foster care and adoptive families in our state," he said. "This magnificent new online resource will be telling encouraging stories of success and provide opportunities for Arkansans across the state to volunteer and learn more about foster care." The Every Child Arkansas network aims to ensure Arkansas has "more than enough" foster families, adoptive families and support for biological families, Goad said. The coalition includes organizations such as CASA for Children, CarePortal, Children's Homes Inc., Project Zero and others, according to the network's website. "It is our goal and belief that Arkansas can and will be the first state in the United States to reach every child, to be more than enough for every child and every family in every county in our state," he said. Jerome Strickland, executive director of The Contingent Arkansas, announced the partnership was kicking off a marketing campaign dubbed Show Up Arkansas. "If you want to show up and serve, all you have to do is go to www.everychildarkansas.org," said Strickland, pointing to the network's new website. Mischa Martin, deputy director for the Department of Human Services, said the launch of Every Child Arkansas would help communities work with the department's Division of Children and Family Services and partner organizations. "Now our communities can see and work with us and connect," she said. "Great things are going to happen when we come together." The executive order requires the establishment of the Arkansas Strategic Plan for Foster Care Placement. The plan involves a working group composed of Every Child Arkansas and the secretaries of the state Department of Human Services, Department of Public Safety and Department of Education. Among other strategies, the plan will aim to support in-home parenting, deliver mental health and substance abuse treatment services to foster children and biological and foster families, facilitate coordinated monitoring of child safety and recruit foster families committed to supporting biological families and promoting reunification. After developing the strategic plan, the working group will incorporate "trauma-informed training" into existing training systems within the respective departments for child-welfare workers, educators and public safety and law enforcement officers. The coalition also will recommend to the governor any specific actions needed to facilitate the order, including more executive or legislative measures no later than June 30. Sanders' executive order charges the secretary of the Department of Human Services or a designee of the secretary with streamlining the adoption process from state foster care and the placement of children in foster care with relatives. State officials are tasked with submitting a report on "strategies to interrupt generational cycles of abuse and neglect that impact children aging out of foster care," presenting recommendations on measures to avoid homelessness, human trafficking and incarceration for children aging out of foster care, and comparing outcomes for assisting children aging out of foster care in Arkansas with national and regional outcomes. The director of the Division of Children and Family Services is required under the order to meet quarterly with foster care stakeholders "to collaborate on efforts to better serve children and families receiving services through" the division. The meetings will continue through at least the end of the 2025 calendar year, and officials will have to provide annual reports on the meetings to the governor. The Division of Children and Family Services at the Arkansas Department of Human Services is also tasked with creating or coordinating a single-source website location for data related to foster care in the state. The site will include county-level foster care data, an annual report card and operational report for the division, the name and contact information of at least one foster and adoption advocate in each county not employed by the state, and other information suggested by the director of the division, according to the order.

        BENTONVILLE -- Mayor Stephanie Orman gave her State of the City address Tuesday night, looking back at city highlights that happened last year. Her address came at the end of a 17-item City Council meeting. "As I reflect on 2022, I am grateful for our city employees and all they do, for this council and their wisdom and support, for those who choose to serve with their talents and time on a city board or commission, and for a community that works to volunteer and serve our neighbors each and every day," she said. "Whether you are a long-time resident or you have just moved here, the city of Bentonville welcomes you and encourages you to take an active role with us as we strive each day to make Bentonville the best place in the United States for all to live, work and play." A "can-do" attitude defines the city and continues to deliver results and allows officials to honestly face challenges by listening, learning and collaborating for better solutions, Orman said. Bentonville is a top destination for regional, national and worldwide travelers, she said. "From our vibrant downtown square and what we affectionately refer to as the 'Best Trailhead in America' to numerous historical areas, world-class museums, expansive recreational facilities and programs and diverse culinary options, many are visiting our city, and many of those visitors are determining Bentonville is a great place to call home." The declaration of Bentonville as the "The Mountain Biking Capital of the World" continues to attract biking enthusiasts across the country and the world to enjoy award-winning trails, Orman said. In 2022, Bentonville was announced as the new home of the U.S. National Mountain Bike Team. The city continues to see announcements of investment in new housing and businesses driven by an inspiring entrepreneurial spirit, economic resilience, a focus on high quality of life and healthy lifestyles, public safety initiatives, innovative and responsible planning and design, inclusive parks, recreation and library programming, infrastructure investments, and a growing arts, outdoor recreation and cultural scene, she said. In April 2021, residents passed a bond extension designed to help the city keep up with growth, infrastructure, public safety and efficiency improvements without a tax increase. "A major focus of 2022 for staff was to get proposed bond projects designed, bid and underway for completion under the first bond drawdown," Orman said. Senior staff led 611 full-time employees and 147 part-time employees in 2022. "I am pleased to tell you tonight Bentonville enjoyed another great year for sales tax with our per penny amount eclipsing $21 million for the first time," she said. "Bentonville's 2022 sales tax receipts increased by 11% compared to 2021 collections." Transportation Department 2022 capital projects included the completion of the Northwest Third/Southwest Eighth Street bike lane improvements and the South Main Street improvement, which included new widened sidewalks, drainage and street lighting. Water Tower Road phase 1, which included a roundabout and the connection of Southeast Eighth Street from Water Tower Road to Interstate 49, was also completed. The Eighth Street project that extends from Southwest I Street to Southeast J Street is under construction and will provide additional vehicle travel lanes for east/west traffic and the addition of sidewalks and a two-way cycle track that extends the length of the project. The section from Southwest I to South Walton Boulevard was completed and reopened to traffic flow. In stage 1 of the bond program, there are 15 street projects and 13 drainage projects in design phase, Orman said. The Street Department completed 13 miles of pavement preservation, used 210 tons of asphalt for pothole repair and completed 12 miles of pavement crack sealing, Orman said. In 2022, an estimated 4.5 million people, including 2.5 million trail users, visited a city public park. The parks team produced more than 140 recreation programs and special events attended by more than 596,000 people and producing more than $4.3 million in revenue, Orman said. In June, the city opened the Orchards Park Dog Park and destination play area, fulfilling a major need for the park since it opened 10 years ago, Orman said. In December, the city added its 22nd park by accepting a donation from the Bogle Family and formally adding Bob and Marilyn Bogle Park, Orman said. During 2022, the city Emergency Communications Center handled approximately 112,955 calls. About 45,674 calls were Police Department calls for service. Another 7,015 calls were related to fire and EMS calls for service, Orman said. Two large projects approved by the 2021 bond extension were finalized in 2022. The Police Department completed the selection of a public safety radio system and entered into a contract with RACOM/Harris to complete a new radio system. The P25 system will allow full interoperability with surrounding agencies, Orman said. In December, the department began construction of a training facility that will include a live-fire training range, K9 training course and growth for future expansion of training facilities. Completion is set for April. Bentonville continues to rank in the top five safest cities in Arkansas to live in, Orman said. The Fire Department received 12,067 fire/EMS calls for service, up 5% over 2021. There was a 12.4% increase in fires (170), a 33% increase in rescue calls for service (144) and 10.5% increase in automatic alarm calls (739). The Fire Training Division conducted 58,654 hours of training, a 20% increase over 2021, Orman said. The Building and Fire Division saw a 2% increase in building permits (4,806), a 2% decrease in permit fees ($2.3 million) and a 31% decrease in permit value. The office conducted 1,053 housing unit inspections, a 43% increase. They conducted 12,112 building inspections on new construction, a 7% increase, and did 3,071 fire inspections on existing commercial buildings, a 60% increase. In 2022, they conducted 18 fire investigations, down 10% from 2021, according to the mayor's address. In 2022, the public library recorded 763,427 circulations of its collections, including checkouts of physical materials and downloads of digital books. This is the library's highest circulation ever, Orman said. Bentonville planning processed 384 projects, an increase of 5% from property line adjustments, lot splits, rezonings, conditional uses, variances and waivers. Development items made up 58% of all projects and zoning requests made up 42%, Orman said. In 2022, the Planning Commission reviewed 79 rezoning requests, up two from the previous year, and 38 conditional uses, up 65%, Orman said. City planning reviewed 74 large-scale developments, up 23% from 2021, she said. Appointed City Council members and city staff worked with a housing affordability work group throughout 2022 to study and make recommendations to improve the supply of and access to affordable, attainable housing. The Housing Affordability Work Group presented its report to City Council on Jan. 24. Staff is evaluating, prioritizing and assessing the feasibility of the recommendations. "As we look to 2023, we will commemorate the 150th birthday of Bentonville and our incorporation as a city," Orman said. "We look forward to celebrating this milestone with the community as we reflect on who we are, where we came from, what we have accomplished as a community and how we continue to improve upon our future together."  Other action The Bentonville City Council on Tuesday approved: Establishing a short-term rental work group that identifies membership, administrative structure and deliverable timeline. A bid waiver to Downtown Bentonville Inc. and authorizing an agreement for services for 2023. Accepting a $261,000 grant from the Walton Family Foundation for pickleball courts at Creekside Park. The city applying for Federal Carbon Reduction Program funds to aid in construction of the Southwest Bentonville Trail from Morning Star Road to Vendor Boulevard. A $3.5 million bid by Crossland Heavy Contractors Inc. for construction of drainage improvements for Little Osage Creek tributary two. The contract is being paid for with 2021 bond funds.

        HIGHFILL -- Northwest Arkansas National Airport officials say passenger numbers are on track to reach prepandemic levels. The preliminary passenger numbers coming from the federal Transportation Security Administration checkpoint at the airport are trending upward of prepandemic levels, according to Aaron Burkes, airport CEO. If the trend continues, the airport could break its annual record of 922,553 passengers set in 2019. Airport officials use 2019 as a measuring stick because the covid-19 pandemic decimated travel beginning in early 2020 and the airline industry is still working to get back to prepandemic levels. In 2020, passengers at the airport declined 61% to 360,133. "Potentially at least, based on January and February's through-put numbers, we are on track to potentially beat 2019's numbers," Burkes said. "At least that's how this year is starting so far." Through-put is the number of people, passengers and airline personnel, who pass through the TSA checkpoint. Burkes noted with more flyers, parking demand will likely also go up. To that end, airport officials said they'll probably start having discussions about where they can put more parking and whether it's time to look at designing a second parking deck or move rental car businesses to another location. A groundbreaking for the terminal improvement project is set for March 14 after the airport board's meeting. Jim Krall, chairman of the board, said he's excited to see the long-awaited project begin. "Everybody will be able to see that construction take place," said Krall, who represents Siloam Springs on the board. A proposed skybridge connecting the parking garage and terminal was dropped from the project in December. The rest of the renovation will go ahead as planned at an estimated cost of $34 million. There will be more elevators, escalators and stairwells and new baggage-handling equipment. The TSA and police areas will be renovated. There also will be a host of architectural upgrades, including new paint, terrazzo floors, lighting and sound baffles; a new information desk and a canopy along the front of the terminal covering the drop-off area; and new flight information displays. Construction is estimated be completed in about two years.  Print Headline: Passenger numbers taking off at airport Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         ROGERS -- The Police Department will soon buy a virtual reality simulator to train its officers. The City Council on Tuesday unanimously approved the purchase of an Apex virtual reality training simulator from GOVRED Technology Inc. of Las Vegas. Police Chief Jonathan Best said the department is the first in the region to use the Apex simulator, which will allow officers to do much more training at police headquarters. Training technology supplier GOVRED sells virtual reality systems for use by both police officers and soldiers, according to the company's website. The system for police departments, called Apex Officer, includes training in firearms, crisis intervention, deescalation, active shooter threats, traffic stops and a variety of other scenarios. The Apex system creates a more immersive environment than many other training simulators, according to Best. "Traditional simulator training for law enforcement uses a screen or a series of screens to create the training environment," he said. "This vendor is unique in that they use goggles to create a 3D virtual environment for the trainer." When using the technology, trainees wear a virtual reality headset, which covers their eyes. The headset includes a screen intended to provide the appearance of an immersive environment. Trainees can use modified firearms and stun guns in the sessions. The department has heard "rave reviews" from other law enforcement agencies using the technology, according to Best. The Apex simulator comes with 35,000 different scenarios, which are all able to be tweaked by the trainer, he said. "In one scenario, the guy can reach into a car and pull out a gun. In the next one, the training operator can make him pull out a cellphone or a wallet," he said. The department is allowed to use up to $73,913 for the purchase, which will include two headsets and accompanying equipment, he said. Funds for the equipment were accounted for in the city's 2023 budget, which was approved by the council in November. The Apex Officer technology is currently being used by at least one law enforcement agency or department in every U.S. state, Apex announced in January. The Pulaski County Sheriff's Office became the first agency in Arkansas to use the system last July. In other news, the council also approved a proposed adaptation of an empty building at 1639 N. Arkansas St. to a 12-unit multifamily rental development. Council members unanimously approved rezoning the property north of downtown from residential office zoning to residential multifamily rental zoning.

        LITTLE ROCK -- An Arkansas Senate committee on Tuesday advanced a bill that would require the secretary of state to permit and arrange the placement on the state Capitol grounds of a suitable monument commemorating "unborn children aborted" during the era of the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court ruling under Roe v. Wade. In a voice vote with Sen. Clarke Tucker, D-Little Rock, dissenting, the Senate committee sent Senate Bill 307 by Sen. Kim Hammer, R-Benton, to the 35-member Senate. If enacted, the measure would be known as the "Monument to Unborn Children Display Act." On June 24, then-Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge signed a certificate implementing a 2019 law that bans abortions in Arkansas except to save the life of the mother in a medical emergency, just hours after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the landmark 1973 ruling that legalized abortion across the nation. Under Senate Bill 307, the Capitol Arts and Grounds Commission would oversee the selection of the artist and design of the monument "with input from pro-life groups in Arkansas." The secretary of state would have final approval of the selection of the artist and design of the monument selected by the commission before any construction is started under SB307. Upon approval of the artist and design, the secretary of state would be required to arrange for the construction, placement and dedication of the monument on the state Capitol grounds by private entities at no expense to the state of Arkansas. The bill would establish on the books of the state treasurer, the state auditor and the state's chief fiscal officer a trust fund to consist of gifts, grants and donations from individuals and organizations and other funds as may be provided by law. The trust fund would be used exclusively for erecting and maintaining a suitable monument on the state Capitol grounds commemorating "unborn children aborted" during the Roe v. Wade era. Tucker said he hopes everyone can agree it is by and large an intensely personal decision for a person choosing to get an abortion for varying reasons. "Some women, who made that decision, may regret it or ... may appreciate having a monument on the state Capitol," he said. "I am not saying it is universal, but I would have to believe that there are scores of women out there who felt like they had to make a decision either for their own health or for whatever reason it might be, and for there to be a public monument, which is a visual reminder, would just be adding pain to the process." Hammer said he wants to be respectful of women who have made decisions to have abortions, including some women who found themselves in unfortunate situations. "I want the monument to be tasteful, respectful [and] honoring of the babies that were not privileged to see life on Earth, although I believe life begins at conception," he said. "I would want it to be sensitive to the fact that if somebody walks by that monument it respects the multitude of emotions that are represented in that monument," Hammer said. "But at the same token, we do have monuments on the Capitol grounds that celebrate life, as in the Little Rock Nine, that recognize lives that were given in the line of duty both in the military and as public servants. We have monuments for a wide range of things on the Capitol grounds." He said it is important to have visual reminders of a painful chapter in the state's history. During the period from 1973 until 2022, at least 236,243 elective abortions were performed in Arkansas, according to Hammer's Senate Bill 307. "I think the number alone is significant enough that it deserves recognition, and we deserve to be reminded of it," Hammer said. But Tucker said "we are just memorializing the consequence of a conscious choice that these women made." He said people in Arkansas have strong opinions on multiple sides about abortion, but the other memorials on the state Capitol largely have broad support among the state's general population. Hammer countered that "I think the majority has spoken on the [abortion] issue. "The Ten Commandment monument was a very controversial monument that was placed on the Capitol, but the majority spoke because I think they saw the value in having a reminder," he said. Afterward, Hammer said he hopes the proposed monument could be erected onto the state Capitol grounds within the next two years. He said he has been approached by monument companies interested in donating the monument.  Print Headline: Memorial bill advances to full Senate Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        BENTONVILLE — A Siloam Springs teacher is free on $75,000 bond after his arrest last week on a sexual assault charge involving a student. Prosecutors have not filed a formal charge against Ethan Wells, 29, who was listed as a choir teacher at Siloam Springs Middle School. The investigation started after the mother of one of Wells former students reported to police a sexual relationship between her son and Wells, according to a probable cause affidavit. Siloam Springs Superintendent Jody Wiggins said in a statement the district received information alleging inappropriate activity by a secondary level teacher during the 2021-22 school year. He said the district notified local law enforcement and filed a report with the Department of Human Services hotline. Wells was placed on administrative leave. Immediate termination of his contract has been recommended, Wiggins said. The mother said her son was 18 years old at the time, but he had not graduated from high school, according to the affidavit. The former student reported he met Wells in the eighth grade when Wells was his choir teacher, according to the affidavit. The student said he and Wells started texting each other and became close friends, the affidavit states. He said Wells became his mentor, but his senior year he started having feelings for Wells, according to the affidavit. The student said after he turned 18 years old, he told Wells in April 2022 how he felt about him, the affidavit states. Wells told the student he also had feelings for him, according to the affidavit. The student said he and Wells engaged in a sex act twice at school, according to the affidavit. He said their relationship lasted from April 11 to June 23, and, after graduation, he realized what occurred between Wells and himself was wrong, according to the affidavit. Wells arraignment is scheduled for 8 a.m. April 3 in Benton County Circuit Judge Robin Greens courtroom. District Judge Jeff Conner ordered Wells not to have any contact with his former student. Wells is earning $53,213 in his teaching position this school year, according to district documents. He was named the Arkansas Choral Directors Association Region 6 Junior High Distinguished Director in 2021.  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         WASHINGTON -- A 29-state coalition led by the state of Arkansas prevailed in a lawsuit against the state of Delaware in a 9-0 U.S. Supreme Court opinion over unclaimed MoneyGram funds when the high court issued an opinion Tuesday saying those funds should be refunded to the states where the transfers originated. According to a news release from Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin, the state led a 2016 lawsuit against the state of Delaware over the issue of whether unclaimed and abandoned funds related to MoneyGram official checks should be released to the plaintiff states where the checks were purchased or the state of Delaware, where MoneyGram -- which is headquartered in Dallas -- is incorporated. According to Forbes Magazine, more than 1.6 million businesses from around the world -- including Walmart, Amazon, American Express, Disney, Google and Tesla -- are incorporated in Delaware because of the state's tax code, privacy laws and legal system. In 2016, Griffin's office said, Arkansas brought an original jurisdiction action in the Supreme Court seeking more than $250 million in unclaimed funds from uncashed MoneyGram official check products that it claimed were wrongfully handed over to the state of Delaware. The case, Arkansas et al. v. Delaware, centered on which state is entitled to take custody of funds payable on unclaimed official checks sold by MoneyGram, a money transfer services company that operates in all 50 states and internationally. Under the Federal Disposition Act, Griffin said, proceeds on unclaimed money orders, traveler's checks and similar items must be turned over to the state where an item was purchased. But, Griffin said, since 2005, MoneyGram has turned those funds over to Delaware, as its state of incorporation. On Tuesday, the high court agreed that those funds are governed by the Federal Disposition Act and that MoneyGram should have turned those funds over to Arkansas and its coalition partners, not Delaware. In Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson's first opinion as a Supreme Court justice, Jackson said that MoneyGram checks are similar enough to money orders to be covered under the Federal Disposition Act, which means the hundreds of millions of dollars in unclaimed funds currently claimed by Delaware will instead go to the states in which the MoneyGram purchases originated. Under the Federal Disposition Act, states are "entitled to the proceeds" of unclaimed money orders and traveler checks that originated in their state. "We hold that the FDA covers the instruments in question and thus that they should general escheat to the State of purchase," Jackson wrote in her opinion. "When a financial product operates like a money order ... it is sufficiently 'similar' to a money order to fall presumptively within the FDA." Other states in the coalition are Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming. The coalition is led by Arkansas, with a leadership group from California, Texas and Wisconsin. Pennsylvania is allied with Arkansas's coalition and did not argue separately, but deferred to Arkansas. "This is an important win for Arkansas and our coalition of states," Griffin said in a press release Tuesday. "For the past decade, Delaware has claimed millions of dollars that rightfully belong to us, and that money will now go where it belongs."

         BENTONVILLE -- The Benton County Quorum Court approved a special election to decide whether to increase the annual fee for the Beaver Lake Fire Department. The board for the Beaver Lake Fire Department requested the Quorum Court approve an ordinance for the special election. The justices of the peace approved the ordinance at Tuesday's meeting. The election will be May 9. The annual fee is $150, and the request is for an increase to $200 yearly. Steve Long, who lives in the district, encouraged the Quorum Court to approve the ordinance to allow the members to vote on the measure. "Let the voters of the fire district take control over fees," he said. Long said voting against the special election would deny the will of the people in the process. Sheila Gallagher, a member of the district, said she was divided on the issue but questioned whether there is an emergency requiring the special election. She wanted the board to hire a part-time chief who could determine staffing issues before having a special election. David Cauldwell, a fire board member, said the board is seeking to hire a part-time chief who may be able to hire more part-time staff. Cauldwell said the staffing will continue to be sparse for the remainder of the year. He said more coverage will be increased next year if the fee increase passes in the election. Larry Smith, another board member, encouraged the Quorum Court to approve the ordinance for the special election to give the members an opportunity to vote. Mary Gardener, who lives in the district, said communication had improved with the fire board, but she did not think the communication had improved enough to support the special election. She asked the justices of the peace to vote against the ordinance. Justice of the Peace Joel Jones moved for the Quorum Court to approve the ordinance. He said he knows the board has changed and is looking for a new chief. He said the new board had not yet met or provided the Quorum Court with any additional information. Jones asked audience members who live in the district for a show of hands whether they were in favor of or opposed to the ordinance. More people favoring the vote raised their hands. Justice of the Peace Ken Farmer said the Quorum Court would be adding another year of uncertainty to the fire board and district if it did not approve the ordinance. The justices of the peace voted 13-1 to approve the special election. Justice of the Peace Joseph Bollinger was the lone vote against the ordinance. The Quorum Court voted to suspended the rules and held the three readings at Tuesday's meeting. The vote was the same on the next two readings. The ordinance needed three readings for the special election to be placed on the ballot. Bollinger said he voted against the ordinance because he was concerned that members of the fire district had not been given enough time to be made aware of the election and tax increase. The board attempted to increase the fees last year but ended up withdrawing the measure. The board withdrew a petition in August to start a process to raise the rates. Under the plan that was withdrawn, residents would have had to pay based on the appraised value of their homes. There was heavy opposition to the planned rate increases.

         Arkansas and 14 of its cities will be allocated portions of roughly $44 million in annual grants for affordable housing, community development, and homeless assistance, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced Monday. The state's funding is part of $5.6 billion HUD is distributing to 1,200 communities across the country. The money is targeted through five separate programs, and not every city receiving grants will get money from every program. Arkansas is receiving funds through only four of the programs. "Viable communities must promote integrated approaches to develop decent housing, suitable living environments, and expand economic opportunities to the most vulnerable," said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge in a press release. "These funds allow communities to address their unique needs by prioritizing what matters most to their residents and letting them own their investments in community development through these important federal resources." Arkansas is slated for $17.8 million via the Community Development Block Grants, an annual grant for states, cities and counties for providing decent housing and a suitable living environment, and by expanding economic opportunities, principally for low- and moderate-income people. The 14 cities -- West Memphis, Texarkana, Springdale, Rogers, Pine Bluff, North Little Rock, Little Rock, Jonesboro, Jacksonville, Hot Springs, Fort Smith, Fayetteville, Conway and Bentonville -- will all receive funds from the grant, with Little Rock the only one receiving more than a million dollars at $1.4 million. According to HUD, in 2022 the program helped more than 60,000 families through housing activities, 46,000 individuals through job creation or retention, 83,500 people experiencing homelessness through improvements to homeless facilities, more than 5.3 million people through public services, and over 39 million people through public improvements. Arkansas is getting $10.5 million from the HOME Investment Partnerships Program. HOME is a tool used by states and local governments to produce affordable rental and owner-occupied housing for low-income families. HUD reported that in 2022 the program helped create more than 15,000 units of housing and nearly 17,000 households were assisted with tenant-based rental assistance through the HOME program. Pine Bluff ($268,888), North Little Rock ($396,150), Little Rock ($844,274), Fayetteville ($512,642) and Fort Smith ($462,538) are the only Arkansas cities also receiving HOME funding. Arkansas is receiving $2.3 million in Emergency Solutions Grants. This funding is dedicated for homeless shelters, assisting in the operation of local shelters and funds related to social service and homeless prevention programs. Each year, the program connects more than 350,000 people to emergency shelters as they transition to permanent housing. Arkansas ($1.4 million) and Little Rock ($1.03 million) will be allocated funds for Housing Opportunities for Persons With HIV/AIDS (HOPWA). The program provides stable and permanent housing assistance and supportive services to low-income people living with HIV. More than 100,000 households receive HOPWA housing assistance and/or supportive services annually.

         WASHINGTON -- In arguments lasting more than three hours Tuesday in two separate cases, conservative justices holding the Supreme Court's majority questioned the Biden administration's authority to broadly cancel, wipe away or reduce federal student loans held by millions of Americans because of the covid-19 emergency. Loan payments that have been on hold since the start of the coronavirus pandemic three years ago are supposed to resume no later than this summer. Without the loan relief promised by the Biden plan, the administration's top Supreme Court lawyer said, "delinquencies and defaults will surge."   The plan has so far been blocked by Republican-appointed judges on lower courts. President Joe Biden's only hope for being allowed to move forward appeared to be the slim possibility, based on the arguments, that the court would find that Republican-led states and individuals challenging the plan lacked the legal right to sue. That would allow the court to dismiss the lawsuits at a threshold stage, without ruling on the basic idea of the loan forgiveness program that appeared to trouble the justices on the court's right side. Chief Justice John Roberts was among the justices who grilled Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar and suggested that the administration had exceeded its authority. Three times, Roberts said the program would cost $500 billion, pointing to its wide impact and hefty expense as reasons the administration should have gotten explicit approval from Congress. The administration says the program is grounded in a 2003 law that was enacted in response to the military conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan and has estimated its cost at $400 billion over 30 years. "If you're talking about this in the abstract, I think most casual observers would say if you're going to give up that much ... money, if you're going to affect the obligations of that many Americans on a subject that's of great controversy, they would think that's something for Congress to act on," Roberts said.  Justice Brett Kavanaugh said it "seems problematic" for the administration to use an "old law," the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act of 2003, usually called the HEROES Act, to unilaterally implement a debt relief program that Congress had declined to adopt. The HEROES Act gives the secretary of education the power to "waive or modify any statutory or regulatory provision" to protect borrowers affected by "a war or other military operation or national emergency." "Some of the biggest mistakes in the court's history were deferring to assertions of executive emergency power," Kavanaugh said. "Some of the finest moments in the court's history were pushing back against presidential assertions of emergency power." At another point, though, Kavanaugh suggested the program might be on firmer legal ground than other pandemic-related programs that were ended by the court's conservative majority, including an eviction moratorium and a requirement for vaccines or frequent testing in large workplaces. Those earlier programs halted by the court were billed largely as public health measures intended to slow the spread of covid-19. The loan forgiveness plan, by contrast, is aimed at countering the economic effects of the pandemic. Prelogar said its plan fit comfortably within the statutory language, which she said had authorized the secretary of education to act. "The whole point of this statute, its central mission and function, is to ensure that in the face of a national emergency that is causing financial harm to borrowers, the secretary can do something," she said. Prelogar and some of the liberal justices sought several times to turn the arguments back to the people who would benefit from the program. The administration says that 26 million people have applied to have up to $20,000 in federal student loans forgiven under the plan. "The states ask this court to deny this vital relief to millions of Americans," she said. Justice Sonia Sotomayor said her fellow justices will be making a mistake if they take for themselves, instead of leaving it to education experts, "the right to decide how much aid to give" people who will struggle if the program is struck down. "Their financial situation will be even worse because once you default, the hardship on you is exponentially greater. You can't get credit. You're going to pay higher prices for things," Sotomayor said. But Roberts pointed to evident favoritism. "Didn't half the borrowers say they would not have any trouble paying their loans without regard to the forgiveness program?" Roberts asked. Prelogar said it would be difficult to segregate the two groups and that the pause in loan repayments applied to all borrowers. Roberts offered a hypothetical example of a person who passes up college to start a lawn service with borrowed money. "Nobody's telling the person who is trying to set up the lawn service business that he doesn't have to pay his loan," Roberts said. "We like to usually leave situations of that sort, when you're talking about spending the government's money, which is the taxpayers' money, to the people in charge of the money, which is Congress." Sotomayor responded that "everybody suffered in the pandemic, but different people got different benefits because they qualified under different programs." Justice Elena Kagan also addressed the chief justice's concern. "Congress passed a statute that dealt with loan repayment for colleges, and it didn't pass a statute that dealt with loan repayment for lawn businesses," she said. "And so Congress made a choice, and that may have been the right choice or it may have been the wrong choice, but that's Congress' choice." SIDES DRAWN In separate cases, six Republican-led states -- Nebraska, Missouri, Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas and South Carolina -- and two individuals are lined up against the plan as a violation of Biden's executive authority. Democratic-led states and liberal interest groups are backing the administration in urging the court to allow the plan to take effect. The justices' questions mirrored the partisan political divide over the issue, with conservatives arguing that noncollege workers should not be penalized and liberals arguing for the break for the college educated. Speaking on the eve of the arguments, Biden said, "I'm confident the legal authority to carry that plan is there." The president, who once doubted his own authority to broadly cancel student debt, first announced the program in August. Legal challenges quickly followed. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona proposed a plan that would affect more than 40 million borrowers, about half of whom would see their balances wiped clean. It would eliminate up to $10,000 of student debt for borrowers earning up to $125,000 annually, or up to $250,000 for married couples. Those who received Pell Grants, a form of financial aid for low- and middle-income students, are eligible for an additional $10,000 in forgiveness. The HEROES Act was primarily intended to keep service members from being hurt financially while they fought in wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Nebraska and other states that sued say the 20 million borrowers who would have their entire loans erased would get a "windfall" leaving them better off than before the pandemic. "This is the creation of a brand new program, far beyond what Congress intended," Nebraska Solicitor General James Campbell said in court Tuesday. The national emergency is expected to end May 11, but the administration says the economic consequences will persist, despite historically low unemployment and other signs of economic strength. In addition to the debate over the authority to forgive student debt, the court is confronting whether the states and two individuals whose challenge also is before the justices have the legal right, or standing, to sue. Parties generally have to show that they would suffer financial harm in order to have standing in cases such as this. A federal judge initially found that the states would not be harmed and dismissed their lawsuit before an appellate panel said the case could proceed. Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined the three liberal justices in repeatedly questioning Nebraska's Campbell on that issue. But it would take at least one other conservative vote to form a majority. "Why didn't the state just make MOHELA [the Missouri Higher Education Loan Authority] come then?" Barrett asked. Campbell, Nebraska's solicitor general, who represented the states, said it was "a question of state politics." Prelogar conceded that the loan authority would have standing had it chosen to sue in its own name. But it did not, she said, and Missouri was not entitled to sue on its behalf. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said the authority was independent of the state. TEXAS CASE The second case, Department of Education v. Brown, was brought by the two borrowers, Myra Brown and Alexander Taylor, and it also raised questions about standing. Of the two individuals who sued in Texas, Brown is ineligible for relief under the plan because her loans are held by commercial entities rather than the government, while Taylor is eligible for $10,000 rather than $20,000 because he did not receive a Pell Grant. The challenges by Brown and Taylor would not benefit them, but instead would ensure that no one gets relief from the loan forgiveness program, Prelogar said. A trial court ruled that they had standing to sue because they had been deprived of the opportunity to urge the administration to expand the plan to provide greater debt relief. "Talk about ways in which courts can interfere with the processes of government through two individuals in one state who don't like the program can seek and obtain a universal relief barring it for anybody anywhere," Justice Neil Gorsuch said. If the Supreme Court rules that at least one plaintiff in one of the cases has standing, it will address whether the debt forgiveness plan is lawful. Among those in the courtroom Tuesday was Kayla Smith, a recent graduate of the University of Georgia, who camped out near the court the night before in order to get a seat. Biden's plan would lift a burden for her mother, who borrowed more than $20,000 in federal student loans to help Smith attend college. "It just seems kind of messed up that college is the expectation, higher education is the expectation, but then at the same time, people's lives are being ruined," said Smith, 22, of Atlanta. The cases are Biden v. Nebraska and U.S. Department of Education v. Brown. A decision is expected by late June.

        The Central Arkansas Library Systems galleries and bookstore located in downtown Little Rock will close on May 31 to accommodate other services in the lead-up to the closure of the Main Library for remodeling, officials said Tuesday. Work to remodel the Main Library could begin in September, said Lance Ivy, the library systems director of facilities and operations, during a news conference held inside Concordia Hall of the Bobby L. Roberts Library of Arkansas History & Art. At the news conference, which was billed as a “media day,” Ivy and other library officials provided updates on the future renovation, new initiatives and coming events. Ivy put the timeline for the Main Library construction at 14-16 months, depending on how things go. The Main Library, located at 100 S. Rock St., opened in September 1997 — the building was originally constructed as a warehouse in 1920 — but it has not experienced a major overhaul since, according to the library system. Th e f ive - s to r y, 156,000-square-foot buildings new features after the remodeling might include an atrium-style entrance, better outdoor space in the back and a dedicated space for homeless patrons, according to the library system. Although at the moment the Main Librarys lower level is open to the public only during periodic used-book sales, it will become “almost entirely available” to patrons post-renovation, a handout from the library system on Tuesday said. The building will be closed to the public during renovation. To keep some services available to individuals in the downtown area in the meantime, library officials plan to repurpose various spaces in the Roberts Library in a temporary setup they have dubbed “Mini Main.” Other services and programs are anticipated to operate out of the nearby Cox Building. The Roberts Library is expected to house spaces for reading or studying, a computer lab, areas for children and teens as well as popular books and magazines, Ivy said. Some have criticized the decision to close the Galleries & Bookstore at Library Square, and opponents of the move recently voiced their concerns at a Jan. 26 library system board meeting. Library officials have yet to lay out in detail how the space set to become “Mini Main” inside the Roberts Library might be used after the actual Main Library reopens in 2025. The handout said that following the renovation, “the downstairs space of the Roberts Library will be repurposed but will continue to showcase local art and rotating exhibitions.” Last year, library officials selected a team of architects to oversee the remodeling work at the Main Library. On Feb. 8, a library committee chose CDI Contractors to carry out the construction work, although a measure authorizing an agreement with the firm has yet to come before the board. Staff who work in the Main Library will have to relocate during the transition. Some will go to 7773 Sloane Drive in Little Rock, a building just southeast of Bill and Hillary Clinton National Airport/ Adams Field where library officials have leased 32,000 square feet of space. The Sloane Drive building also is expected to host used-book sales while the Main Library is closed. The final two used-book sales downtown are scheduled for March 9-11 and July 13-15. The Main Library remodeling is the result of a referendum last May in which Little Rock voters authorized the extension of a capital-improvement millage at the lower rate of 1.3 mills — a reduction of 0.5 mill — as well as the refinancing of library bonds. The refinancing was meant to generate some $22 million to use on improvements, including the Main Library overhaul. Ivy on Tuesday noted that the library systems new bookmobile — another expenditure bankrolled by proceeds from the bond refinancing — is expected to arrive this fall.

        Pulaski County Judge Barry Hyde gave his State of the County address on Tuesday at the North Little Rock Innovation Hub, marking the first time the space has hosted the event. The event also featured a performance from Argenta Community Theater for the first time, with over 150 in attendance. Hyde, the countys chief executive, thanked the many elected officials present before giving his address. He mentioned that Pulaski County is a regional leader in economic development, innovation and accessible community services “by being fiscally conservative and goal-oriented.” In his speech, Hyde pointed out the Little Rock Port as a “bedrock” for expanding its ability to attract employers and positively impact the economy. It currently provides jobs for over 10,000 individuals in central Arkansas counties. Since Hyde took office in 2015, the Pulaski County Brownfields program, which supports redevelopment of vacant and contaminated properties, has provided more than $1.6 million in funding to support 54 redevelopment projects. It has also leveraged approximately $145 million for remediation projects in rural and urban areas and saved 10 historical buildings, thus creating hundreds of construction and permanent jobs. “A vitally important aspect of our growth and progress is based on our commitment to innovation,” Hyde said. “By implementing innovative technology, infrastructure and sustainability programs, Pulaski County has positioned itself for a bright and prosperous future.” By the end of next year, the countys two solar farms will provide over 90% of the countys buildings and ports offices energy. As a result, Hyde said, the county expects to save approximately $250,000 a year in electricity costs. In addition, the energy and efficiency improvements to all county buildings are projected to reduce energy and water consumption by 68% and save taxpayers an additional $446,000 annually. Hyde also mentioned Pulaski County was the first to establish curbside recycling for residents in unincorporated areas. The program has seen approximately 3 million pounds of recycled materials diverted from landfills every year. The countys first Crisis Stabilization Unit was also mentioned, as it has served 1,300 individuals annually, with an average stay of two and a half days. “This translates into 2,756 days of treatment as opposed to incarceration,” Hyde said. The states first Community Village for chronically homeless people at 6900 Green Road on a 150-acre lot in a rural part of southwest Pulaski County will offer a permanent and an affordable option for those seeking housing. Led by Community Services Department Director Frederick Love, the village will provide residents with programs to assist them with physical and emotional needs. For the past eight years, Hyde said the county has doubled its Rental Assistance Program, added a veterans housing component and extended its Emergency Solutions Program to assist the homeless. “Annually, our supportive housing programs help 453 individuals suffering from behavioral disorders, chronic illness and HIV/AIDS,” he said. “Participants receive the comfort of knowing they have a safe place to call home while receiving essential medical and behavioral health services.” Over 700 veterans receive assistance every year by the housing and rental assistance program. The Pulaski County Youth Services department has flourished since its inception by “engaging young citizens and empowering them” with necessary resources, Hyde said. The free ACT Prep Program averages 500 participants a year, and the new Teen Court Model for Restorative Justice is a credited class where students can correct behaviors and develop healthy habits. In 2019, after-school and summer programs were expanded to the Higgins, Oak Grove and McAlmont communities. These programs now serve 200 youth a day, 70% of whom come from single-parent homes and are 80% more likely to need nutritional assistance. To meet the demand, Hyde announced that this summer the county will partner with Lawson Elementary School in the Pulaski County Special School District and Seis Puentes, a nonprofit organization in North Little Rock with programs that help Hispanic people with education, information and resources. A summer workforce preparedness program will also launch at Mills High School in southeast Pulaski County to connect students with local employers. Hyde also reviewed the countys recent allocation of American Rescue Plan Funds for many projects. The county was able to partner with the Arkansas Hunger Relief Alliance to provide the delivery of 140,000 meals to over 11,000 residents last year. The funds also gave way for the county to partner with the Arkansas Regional Innovation Hub to bring STEAM programs to students via the hubs mobile makerspace. Over 2,000 youth have benefited from the mobile makerspaces various workshops. Hyde addressed the countys close monitoring of traffic flow around Two Rivers Park, the Big Dam Bridge and the River Trail System to ensure safety of visitors. A new traffic circle was installed at Two Rivers Park trailhead and at North Landing at the foot of the Big Dam Bridge. One of the most exciting developments, Hyde said, is the all-inclusive playground at Two Rivers Park. Once complete, it will be the largest all-inclusive playground in the state. “Concurrently, the county is in the process of updating all of our county-owned playgrounds to meet ADA compliance,” he added. “Soon, there will be 10 inclusive playgrounds in the unincorporated areas of the county.” Hyde, a former state legislator, concluded by saying that “While retrograde policies and divisiveness have afflicted many within our state, Pulaski County will not stand for it. “We will continue to innovate and move forward, never backwards,” he said. “We will work together to ensure that Pulaski County is a community where everyone feels welcome and respected. Together we have achieved much, and together we can achieve more.” County Attorney Adam Fogleman said the county is forward-looking and working on efforts now for the solar array and the community village, which will have lasting impacts. “The judge did a great job over the last eight years,” he said. “Hes put together a very good team. And with that team, weve been able to make pretty big strides in a lot of areas. Its hard to really encapsulate all the business of a county into a relatively short speech. But I think he hit the high points on the major strides that have been taken in the last eight years and certainly in the last four.”  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        The Little Rock School District is continuing to seek an attorney generals opinion on the legality of holding private school board meetings when reacting to a cyber- or ransomware attack on a districts electronic information systems. Little Rock Superintendent Jermall Wright sent a lengthy letter in January to the attorney generals office asking how to appropriately balance a school boards obligations for disclosure under state law with the risk of harm to students and employees that public discussion of a cyberattack could pose. Eric Walker, staff attorney for the 21,000-student Little Rock district that experienced a cyberattack late last year, said this week that the matter is pending. “We did submit a request,” Walker said. “The response was that the Superintendent was not the proper person that could make the request. The response indicated that we should ask a member of the Arkansas General Assembly to submit the request on behalf of LRSD. Sen. Clarke Tucker agreed to submit it for us. Ive not heard back yet.” In his letter to the states lawyers, Wright described in some detail what happened in the Little Rock district cyberattack and said the district “is working diligently to be better protected the next time threat actors attempt a ransomware attack.” “In order for LRSD and other Arkansas school districts to be better prepared, legally, the LRSD requests the opinion of the Attorney General concerning the steps a school board may take to minimize the risk to employees and patrons, to deal effectively with the threat actors, and to restore normal operations as quickly as possible.” Wright specifically asked how a board can strike an appropriate balance between the Arkansas Freedom of Information Act — that requires prior public notice of a meeting and for most meetings to be open to the public — and the threat of harm posed by public discussion on a cyberattack. “Can a school board meet privately to discuss how best to respond to a threat actor when the alternative is to risk the disclosure by the threat actors of the personal information of school district patrons and employees?” he asked. Wright noted that the district was advised by the data security consultants that public disclosure of information related to the attack would greatly increase the risk of the attackers releasing the personal information and hindering normal operations for the school system. Regarding what happened in the Little Rock district, Wright wrote that; “The attackers (threat actors) obtained access to files which contained information about LRSD employees and patrons, including dates of birth, social security numbers, personal addresses, medical information, and personal banking information. “The threat actors also obtained student records, including FERPA-protected information,” he continued. “The release of this information would have put those individuals at risk of having their personal information compromised.” Wright also said the operations of the district were jeopardized. “The cyber attack adversely impacted LRSDs ability to educate its students and maintain its finances because LRSD was forced to disconnect from eSchool and eFinance” which are statewide school data-reporting systems. “This meant that teachers could not input grades or attendance, and parents were not notified by the automatic call system when their children were absent or tardy,” he said. Additionally, the district was delayed in ordering supplies, he said. Wright first told all district employees and the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette on Dec. 1 that the district was a victim of a data network breach, and that the district had employed external computer forensics experts to determine the scope of the problem. The cyberattack — first detected Nov. 11 — was also reported to the FBI. “Although the investigation is still ongoing, our forensic partners have determined that some data may have been taken from our network,” Wright said in that early December message. The School Board in a 6-3 vote at a public meeting on Dec. 5 authorized Wright to enter into a settlement of at least $250,000 to end, as favorably as possible for the district, the cyberattack on the data networks. The School Board had met earlier, Nov. 21, in a session for which no legally required public notice was given. District leaders relied on state laws that exempted disclosure of security plans as a reason for the private session, although the laws did not authorize private school board meetings on the topic. Greg Adams, president of the School Board at the time, said a majority of the board felt it was imperative to hold the meeting in private, because of the specific discussions on the districts networks, concerns about the actions of the cyberattackers and the potential for others to attack the school system. Adams said at the time that he was “keenly aware” that the private meeting “eroded public trust.” “Moving forward, as we complete our investigation into what occurred in this incident and make sure our systems and networks are as secure as they can be, we will provide information to you about what happened, what we did, and what we are doing.”  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        FORT SMITH — University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences officials announced Tuesday an anonymous donor gave $600,000 to the school to continue providing contraception devices for uninsured post-partum patients in Fort Smith and Little Rock. Officials said in a news release the intrauterine devices and birth-control implants are inserted before a woman is discharged after giving birth, to reduce unintended pregnancies and increase birth spacing. Insertions can cost more than $3,000 and arent reimbursable by the state Medicaid program, according to the release. UAMS said the money is provided as part of the Increasing Equity and Access to Contraception in Arkansas Initiative. Last year, UAMS received $175,000 to supply the devices to 297 women at two birthing hospitals — UAMS Medical Center in Little Rock and Baptist Health-Fort Smith. This year, a UAMS team led by Dr. Nirvana Manning of the UAMS College of Medicine Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology intends to provide them to 449 patients in those facilities as well as the UAMS West Family Medicine Residency Program in Fort Smith. “This grant has been instrumental in not only providing access to contraceptive coverage that is in line with national recommendations, but also in providing data that we hope will support the expansion to all patients, regardless of insurance coverage,” Manning said. The application said a study in South Carolina showed the use of the devices “was associated with decreased odds of a subsequent short-interval pregnancy.”  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        HOT SPRINGS — A man was arrested Sunday after police said he forced his way into another mans home where he assaulted and raped him and was still there when Hot Springs officers arrived after being flagged down by the accuser. D a C h i n o S h aq u a n Cheatham, 28, of Hot Springs was arrested shortly before 3:30 p.m. on felony charges of rape, residential burglary, aggravated assault and possession of a controlled substance and misdemeanor counts of third-degree battery and first-degree criminal mischief. Cheatham appeared Monday in Garland County District Court, where he pleaded innocent to all the charges and is set for a felony review hearing on April 7 with his bond set at $100,000. According to a probable cause affidavit, shortly after 3 p.m. Sunday, police responded to a report of a possible disturbance called in by a third party who stated someone came to a friends house and attacked him and was still there. Officer Stephan Parrott arrived at the scene and was flagged down by a man, 22, who said a homeless man he knew only as “Dachino” had attacked him and then entered his residence and was still inside, police said. The man said that Dachino had raped him, police said, and officers noted he had a laceration on the side of his neck and injuries to his mouth. Officers went to the mans residence and opened the front door with the mans permission. Inside, they reported locating a second man, later identified as Cheatham, sitting on a sofa. He stood up and officers noted his privates were exposed. Police said they searched Cheatham and found a prescription bottle in someone elses name that contained four hydrocodone pills. The accuser told them he was at his residence when he received a text from Cheatham asking if he had any food, police said. The man was waiting for a friend to pick him up for work, and when he heard a knock at his door a few minutes later he thought it was his friend, police said. The man opened the door partially and saw Cheatham standing there, and Cheatham again asked if he “had any food for him,” police said. The man told him he didnt have any, which made Cheatham mad, so the man attempted to close the door, police said. Cheatham held the door open as they began arguing and then he forced his way into the residence, police said. He then grabbed the alleged victim by the neck, restricting his airway, police said. The man said a scuffle ensued and they began “rolling on the floor” of the residence, police said. At one point, the accuser was able to grab his cellphone, which sustained an impact that automatically sent a 911 alert to his emergency contacts, including the friend he was waiting for, police said. D u r i n g t h e s t r u g g l e, Cheatham allegedly raped the man, who noted Cheatham was “stronger than him” and he was “scared what he would do to him,” police said. The accuser was able to flee the residence at one point and flag down police, who had been alerted by his friend, police said. Cheatham admitted to going to the mans apartment and asking him for food, police said. When the man told him he didnt have any, Cheatham said he became angry because he knew that was not true, police said. A scuffle then ensued, police said Cheatham told them. When asked if anything else happened, Cheatham indicated he and the man had consensual sex and denied raping him, police said. When asked who had started the fight, he said he “did not remember,” police said.  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        100 YEARS AGO March 1, 1923 BENTONVILLE — Within three hours after they are alleged to have robbed the State Bank of Decatur of $2,035, Perry Ingrahm… and Fred Martin….were captured at 4 oclock this afternoon by a posse of about 100 citizens, headed by Sheriff George Maples of Benton County. All the loot was recovered …The robbery was staged shortly after 1 oclock, while only cashier J. W. Hurt, Assistant Cashier Harvey Kuebler, and a customer were in the building. The youthful bandits stopped their Ford car in front of the bank and, with revolvers drawn, forced the three into the vault. The safety catch of the vault door prevented the robbers from closing it. One of them, however, broke the safety and then locked the three men in the vault, after picking up a sack containing $700 in silver. 50 YEARS AGO March 1, 1973 Arkansas has received $5,009,000 grant from the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration to continue its criminal justice improvement program, according to the office of United States Representative John Paul Hammerschmidt of Harrison. The grant was made for fiscal year 1973 after approval of a plan submitted by the State Commission on Crime and Law Enforcement, according to Ray Biggerstaff, Commission Director. Funds totaling $4,482,000 were approved under Part C, which covers specific local programs on the police, courts, juvenile delinquency, communications and other programs aimed at the reduction of crime. 25 YEARS AGO March 1, 1998 Maya Angelou, whose writings have touched so many lives, touched a couple of thousand people with her voice and her presence Saturday night. Angelou was absolutely the perfect choice to narrate Joseph Schwantners New Morning for the World, the centerpiece of the Arkansas Symphony Orchestras gala concert at Robinson Center Music Hall, also broadcast across the state on public radio stations KUAR-FM, 89.1, and KLRE-FM, 90.5. Schwantners piece features passages from the speeches and writings of Martin Luther King Jr., with whom Angelou worked in the civil rights movement. She spent many of her formative years in Arkansas. She has a compelling voice in every respect of the word. 10 YEARS AGO March 1, 2013 An exhibit highlighting black legislators during the Reconstruction era and a bicycle tour of the Little Rock Campaign are among sanctioned events during March by the Arkansas Civil War Sesquicentennial Commission, Chairman Tom Dupree announced. The commissions website, arkansascivilwar150.com/events, carries a complete list of all activities, schedules and contact information for sanctioned events in the state in conjunction with the 150th anniversary of the 1861-65 Civil War. The exhibit on the states black Reconstruction-era lawmakers — African-American Legislators, 1868-1893 — will be displayed in Room 101 of the Justice Building on the state Capitol grounds beginning Monday.

        FAYETTEVILLE — Washington Countys justices of the peace will be looking at up to $20 million in requests for federal covid relief money, with the county having earmarked just $2.3 million in funding. Th e Q u o r u m Co u r t s County Services Committee on Monday heard a report on the initial review of applications for funding from the American Rescue Plan Act. The panel took no action on the requests. County Judge Patrick Deakins said his office would be sending out more detailed information on the requests to the justices of the peace beginning Tuesday. The county received about $46 million in American Rescue Plan Act funds. The Quorum Court agreed last year to make available about $2.3 million in funding to nongovernmental groups and set up an application process. The application period closed at the end of October, and the applications received were sent to the Northwest Arkansas Economic Development District in Harrison to be reviewed for eligibility for the federal funds. According to information from the county, there were 46 applications received during the process with the total amount requested approaching $30 million. Catherine Baker with the Northwest Arkansas Economic Development District, said the district narrowed the applications down to 11 that met the guidelines of their review. Those 11 applications included requests totalling about $20 million. The initial applications ranged in size from $10,000 to more than $8 million and came from long-established charities like the Ronald Mc-Donald House and the Lions Club and organizations including the Washington Water Authority, which submitted four requests ranging from $2.4 million to more than $8 million. The Washington Water Authoritys requests total about $20 million. The distribution process for the American Rescue Plan Act funds was a bone of contention for several months with some nonprofit groups noting the Quorum Court awarded money to some groups without any process in place to accept and evaluate requests. The county allocated about $2.9 million to Upskill NWA for a job-training program to address shortages of qualified employees in health care and another $315,000 to Returning Home, a Springdale nonprofit group helping men who have been incarcerated reintegrate with the community. The use of relief funding for an expansion of the countys jail has also raised questions. The justices of the peace in December approved two ordinances appropriating about $18.8 million in relief money for an expansion of the jail. Some justices of the peace and community activists have questioned whether the jail project is an eligible use for the funds. A petition drive aimed at blocking the two spending ordinances failed to gather enough signatures in the allotted time to force a special election on the ordinances. Also on Monday, the justices of the peace discussed the need for a county emergency operations center. John Luther, the countys emergency services director, told the justices of the peace the office is now housed in a temporary location in Lincoln, using a satellite training facility of the Arkansas Fire Academy. Luther said the county had an emergency operations center in what is now the Northwest Arkansas Crisis Stabilization Unit. When that building was designated for use for the crisis stabilization unit, his office and the emergency operations center were moved to the countys annex building, but that space is now being used by Circuit Judge Diane Warren. Luther said Washington County stands alone among the states larger counties in having no permanent emergency operations center. He said the center is used to bring together and coordinate different agencies and governments in time of emergencies like tornadoes or flooding. The center would be used at other times for training and to provide conference and office space. “The center is the hub of business related to emergencies,” Luther said. “It helps the responders do the jobs they need to do out in the field.” Luther said an emergency operations center should have room to house all of the local emergency response agencies and additional space for state or federal agencies that may need to have people in the county to deal with an emergency situation. Deakins said the county needs to address the issue of having no permanent facility for emergency management and after some discussion told the justices of the peace he saw enough of a consensus among them to begin working on the project. The justices of the peace took no action on the matter Monday.  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        Teen charged with 2nd-degree battery A 16-year-old faces a felony battery charge after he struck a substitute teacher at Little Rock Southwest High School on Tuesday, police spokesman Mark Edwards said. The teenager, who was not identified because he is a minor, is charged with second-degree battery, Edwards said. Preliminary information suggested the student got into a fight with the teacher after he was asked to leave the classroom, he said. State police arrest felon, find weapon Arkansas State Police early Monday arrested a Little Rock man who is a felon and had a stolen gun, according to an arrest report. A trooper tried to pull over a vehicle driven by Tremayne Beasley, 23, near the Geyer Springs Road exit on Interstate 30 around 12:01 a.m. because the vehicle had a nonfunctioning license plate light, the report says. Beasley did not pull over and fled at a low speed, before stopping at the intersection of Geyer Springs Road and Queensboro Drive where the trooper pulled him from his vehicle after asking him to get out several times, the report says. A search of the vehicle located a Glock 19X pistol that had been reported stolen in Sherwood, the report says. Beasley is a convicted felon and cannot legally own a gun. He faces two felony charges — theft by receiving and possession of a firearm by certain persons — as well as a misdemeanor fleeing count and citations for driving on a suspended license and having a nonworking license plate light. He was being held in the Pulaski County jail Tuesday night on a $7,500 bond, a jail inmate roster showed. Traffic stop yields gun, drug charges North Little Rock police around noon Monday arrested a man on gun and drug charges following a traffic stop, according to an arrest report. Officers pulled over a vehicle driven by Brian Bledsoe, 42, of North Little Rock, near 2623 Main St. because Bledsoe was known to have a suspended drivers license, the report says. A search of the vehicle recovered a gun that had been reported stolen, marijuana and a pipe, the report says. Bledsoe faces felony counts of theft by receiving a firearm and possession of a firearm by certain persons, as well as misdemeanor charges of possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia. He was being held Tuesday night in the Pulaski County jail on a $5,000 bond, according to the jails online inmate roster. NLR man arrested, faces two felonies A North Little Rock man faces two felony counts after police arrested him Monday afternoon following a report of a disturbance, according to an arrest report. Police responding to a disturbance at the Best Western Plus Inn and Suites at 115 Pershing Blvd. around 2:14 p.m. encountered Kelso Butler, 29, who had rented the room and is listed in the police report as homeless. Butler had a search waiver on file. A search of the room located a Taurus 9mm pistol that had been reported stolen in Pulaski County and a jar containing marijuana, the report says. As a felon, Butler cannot legally own a gun. He told police someone bought the gun for him off the streets, the report says. He faces felony charges of possession of a firearm by certain persons and theft by receiving, as well as a misdemeanor count of possessing drug paraphernalia. He was being held Tuesday night in the Pulaski County jail on a $15,000 bond, the jails inmate roster showed.  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        FAYETTEVILLE — The Fayetteville Advertising and Promotion Commission on Monday authorized leases for the historic Walker-Stone House and the Town Center. Commissioners voted 5-0 on a separate pair of proposals, one to lease the Walker-Stone House to the Folk School of Fayetteville and the other to renew the lease with the city for the Town Center. The lease with the Folk School is for $1 annually for two years. The lease for the Town Center is rent-free to the commission for 10 years, with an automatic renewal every six months following expiration of the agreement. The commission bought the Civil War-era Walker-Stone House west of the downtown square in 2016. The city owns the Town Center and has leased it to the commission since 1998. The commission earlier this month discussed leasing the Walker-Stone House to the Folk School, the nonprofit group behind Fayetteville Roots. Commissioners supported the idea. Molly Rawn, chief executive officer of the citys tourism bureau, Experience Fayetteville, came back with a lease for commissioners to consider Monday. Bernice Hembree, one of the founders of Fayetteville Roots, last month described the idea for the property as being similar to the Folk School of KDHX in St. Louis. The Folk School of KDHX says on its website its mission is “to build community by providing educational programs that promote the learning, teaching, renewal and perpetuation of traditional music and folk arts.” Under the agreement, the Folk School of Fayetteville will pay $1 annually to rent the house starting today and lasting until Feb. 28, 2025. The commission agreed to pay up to $8,000 in utility costs — specifically water, sewer, trash, electricity and gas — for the school for the first year, with the nonprofit group paying its own utilities in the second year. Additionally, the school asked for first right of refusal for sale of the property. In other words, if someone makes an offer to the commission to buy the house, the school could choose to buy the property first under the same terms. Commissioners agreed to give the school 10 business days to consider such an offer if one were to happen. Rawn said she is not looking to put the house on the market, but the commission would need to consider any significant offer it might receive as good stewards of taxpayer money. The commission receives half of the citys 2% hotel, motel and restaurant sales tax revenue, with the other half going to parks. The commission authorized Rawn to present the proposal for first right of refusal to the school and to sign it if the nonprofit agrees to the terms. Separately, the commission will provide the school $30,000 to cover startup programming costs. The money will be given in two installments. The first $15,000 will be provided once the lease is finalized. The other $15,000 will be provided after the school presents an operating plan to the commission. The lease between the city and commission for the Town Center is largely the same, Rawn said. Under the new agreement, the leases for the Town Center and the centers parking deck will become one. Merging the two leases will make them easier to manage, she said. The new lease also clarifies the terms regarding duration and renewal. Either party can call a meeting to propose changes to the agreement over the course of the 10 years. The lease will automatically renew with the same terms every six months if no action is taken, said Taylor Kelley, outside counsel to the commission. The language in the original lease was unclear, and no one noticed it had expired more than a year ago, she said.  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        HOT SPRINGS — Cracks have formed in the partnership created to secure the multilayered financing that renovated all of the citys 365 public housing units at no cost to the city. The Hot Springs Housing Authority said the management company the partnership selected is not maintaining the units or preparing them for new tenants when they become vacant. It said work orders go unfilled and the grounds have become unkempt because Houston-based Allied Orion doesnt pay its bills. Housing Authority Executive Director Nadine Jarmon said contractors wont do work for Allied Orion. Regular pest control services have lapsed because of nonpayment, she said. “I understand the merchants in Hot Springs are hesitant to do work for them because of lack of payment,” she said last week. A letter she sent Knight Development in January requested a $39,361 reimbursement for expenses the Housing Authority said its incurred on the companys behalf since 2019. Knight is the developer in Mountain View Heights Limited Partnership, the entity formed in 2018 to facilitate the conversion of all of the citys public housing stock to privately owned, rent-controlled units under Section 8 of the Housing Act of 1937. A statement Knight Development sent on Allied Orions behalf pushed back on the Housing Authoritys claims. It said the Housing Authority has received $717,000 in reimbursements. “The reports of resident complaints and disrepair simply arent credible,” Susan Jarvis, Allied Orions vice president of housing operations and compliance, said. “As of this moment, we have completed 50% of the 365-unit inspection and have uncovered nothing more than typical housekeeping maintenance items in the Mountain View tower. “As for work orders, there is no backlog or major complaints on file. Our records show a one-for-one request and service delivery. After conducting a quality control check, we have discovered no anomalies.” Jarmon said the condition of the 245 family units on Spring, Autumn and Illinois streets and 120 senior units on Highrise Circle has gotten others attention, including Hot Springs Republican state Reps. Les Warren and Richard McGrew. She said their communications with U.S. Rep. Bruce Westerman of Hot Springs led to last weeks site visit from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. HUD controls Housing Assistance Payments that service debt issued for the renovation and pay Allied Orions management fees and the Housing Authoritys administrative fees. Tenants pay up to 30% of their adjusted gross income on rent. Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) subsidies pay the balance. “I really think this congressional query is stirring things up,” Jarmon said at last weeks Housing Authority board of commissioners meeting. “Its going to be interesting to see what comes out of these inspections.” A spokesperson for Wester-man confirmed that his office had asked HUD to look into the matter. “Our office was contacted by a couple of state representatives who expressed concern about the living conditions for residents at Mountain View Heights,” she said. City manager Bill Burrough said the city has received numerous complaints about the management of Mountain View Heights. Earlier this week, the city began inspecting all 365 units. “Weve got 70 families who could be living in those today if they were ready to go,” Bur-rough, referring to the number of unoccupied units, said last week. Information the Housing Authority provided its board last week showed 58 vacancies. Jarmon told the board that Allied Orion said there were fewer than 30, but she couldnt confirm that number. Close to 50 prospective tenants were invited to an orientation/screening this week at the Housing Authoritys Illinois Street offices. Jarmon told the board that having qualified applicants at the ready is imperative. The waiting list for one- and two-bedroom units was recently updated. Applicants who didnt respond to multiple letters the Housing Authority sent were de-listed. “We are working with [Allied Orion] to make sure were making every effort to have the units ready to inspect,” she said. “We dont want the onus on us that we held up anything in the process. Lets get plenty of people in the pipeline, have it primed and ready to go so we dont have that onus fall on us.” Units have to pass Housing Authority inspection to qualify for HAP subsidies. Knight Development said the number of vacancies has affected the partnerships working capital and blamed Jarmons predecessor for the low occupancy rate. “The primary challenges this property faces are cash-flow issues stemming, in part, to decisions made by the previous Housing Authority administration during covid despite our strenuous objections,” Knight Development CEO Holly Knight said. “Critical matters related to a lack of referrals and canceled HAP contracts were raised with the Office of Public Housing Little Rock Office. While HUDs response was less forceful than we would have liked, the tide has turned, and our partnership has revived under the new leadership of Dr. Jarmon.” Jarmon told her board that shes worked to improve the relationship with Knight and Allied Orion since taking over the Housing Authority in September. The trio plans to hold a beautification event at the properties in April. “We are actually talking to each,” she said. “Not on a regular basis but at least twice since our last board meeting. Its going pretty well.” The Housing Authority granted Mountain View Heights a 99-year ground lease. The partnership owns the units, but the Housing Authority has right of first refusal on the partnerships ownership interest. The complex arrangement is enabled by HUDs Rental Assistance Demonstration, a program Congress authorized in 2012 to address the more than $25 billion in deferred maintenance the countrys public housing stock had accrued. Allied Orion has been managing the Hot Spring properties since they were converted to private ownership under the Rental Assistance Demonstration program. Richard Herrington Jr., the former director of the local Housing Authority, said in 2018 that Allied Orion was selected for its expertise in managing Low-Income Housing Tax Credit properties. Four percent tax credits Royal Bank of Canada sold in 2017 provided the equity piece in the multilayered financing that renovated all 365 units. They were sold for less than their value, making them attractive to investors seeking to lower their federal tax liabilities, but they could be rescinded if the property falls out of compliance with the requirements of the credits. The Housing Authority said its staff s lack of compliance expertise led to Allied Orions selection as property manager. According to Knight Developments website, $64,000 of construction funding was allocated per unit. The $58 million project included $3.44 million in developer fees for Knight and the Housing Authority.  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        HOT SPRINGS — The Fountain Lake Fire Protection District was left with a skeleton crew after its Board of Commissioners adjourned Monday nights executive session. Treasurer/Secretary John L. Brandt said Tuesday that Chief Steven Burroughs tendered his resignation at the meeting. Most of the volunteer departments roughly two dozen firefighters followed his lead. “After his resignation and he left the building, several of the firefighters turned in their gear,” he said. “We still have firefighters left. All of them did not resign. Were still trying to find out the exact number. We dont know if its six, seven or eight who are still remaining.” Executive sessions are exempted from the states open meetings law, so Brandt said he couldnt share what was discussed at the closed meeting. He said Burroughs had been chief for about two years. B ra n d t sa i d t h e b oa rd planned to meet Tuesday night to discuss how the department will proceed with fewer personnel. “We fully expect to still respond [to calls],” he said. Garland County Department of Emergency Management Director Bo Robertson said Tuesday the countys 911 Communications Center will still dispatch the department. The facility dispatches all of the volunteer departments in the county. “We still tone out calls for service to the Fountain Lake Fire Department,” Robertson, who is also the countys fire services coordinator, said. “If no one answers, we tone them again. If nobody answers after the second tone, per our policy we move on to try to find someone who will respond to calls in their district.” He said hes confident neighboring departments will help fill any gaps in service. “The good thing about our volunteer fire departments is that they have no problem helping out each other, especially when they get something big going on,” Robertson said. “Theyre really good about that.” But finding a mutual aid partner that can respond outside its coverage area takes time. Robertson said the Crows Fire Protection Association, one of the closer departments to Fountain Lake, is in Saline County and cant be dispatched by Garland County. “The unfortunate part of that from a dispatching perspective, is it increases the time a dispatcher has to devote to getting that call for service out to first responders, and our dispatchers dont have that much time to spare,” Robertson said. The department petitioned the Garland County Quorum Court to confer fire protection district status in December 2019. The enabling ordinance the Quorum Court adopted transitioned the department from a nonprofit corporation to a quasi-governmental entity with the power to impose liens or file court claims for unpaid dues. The deed memorializing the transition was recorded in May 2021. Becoming a fire district put the departments annual dues on real estate tax bills the county collectors office mails in February. A 2019 law makes paying fire district dues a prerequisite for paying real estate taxes. The collectors office said Tuesday that it collected $135,010 on the departments behalf in 2020, $112,100 in 2021 and $109,971 last year.  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        HOT SPRINGS — The Fountain Lake Fire Protection District was left with a skeleton crew after its Board of Commissioners adjourned Monday nights executive session. Treasurer/Secretary John L. Brandt said Tuesday that Chief Steven Burroughs tendered his resignation at the meeting. Most of the volunteer departments roughly two dozen firefighters followed his lead. “After his resignation and he left the building, several of the firefighters turned in their gear,” he said. “We still have firefighters left. All of them did not resign. Were still trying to find out the exact number. We dont know if its six, seven or eight who are still remaining.” Executive sessions are exempted from the states open meetings law, so Brandt said he couldnt share what was discussed at the closed meeting. He said Burroughs had been chief for about two years. B ra n d t sa i d t h e b oa rd planned to meet Tuesday night to discuss how the department will proceed with fewer personnel. “We fully expect to still respond [to calls],” he said. Garland County Department of Emergency Management Director Bo Robertson said Tuesday the countys 911 Communications Center will still dispatch the department. The facility dispatches all of the volunteer departments in the county. “We still tone out calls for service to the Fountain Lake Fire Department,” Robertson, who is also the countys fire services coordinator, said. “If no one answers, we tone them again. If nobody answers after the second tone, per our policy we move on to try to find someone who will respond to calls in their district.” He said hes confident neighboring departments will help fill any gaps in service. “The good thing about our volunteer fire departments is that they have no problem helping out each other, especially when they get something big going on,” Robertson said. “Theyre really good about that.” But finding a mutual aid partner that can respond outside its coverage area takes time. Robertson said the Crows Fire Protection Association, one of the closer departments to Fountain Lake, is in Saline County and cant be dispatched by Garland County. “The unfortunate part of that from a dispatching perspective, is it increases the time a dispatcher has to devote to getting that call for service out to first responders, and our dispatchers dont have that much time to spare,” Robertson said. The department petitioned the Garland County Quorum Court to confer fire protection district status in December 2019. The enabling ordinance the Quorum Court adopted transitioned the department from a nonprofit corporation to a quasi-governmental entity with the power to impose liens or file court claims for unpaid dues. The deed memorializing the transition was recorded in May 2021. Becoming a fire district put the departments annual dues on real estate tax bills the county collectors office mails in February. A 2019 law makes paying fire district dues a prerequisite for paying real estate taxes. The collectors office said Tuesday that it collected $135,010 on the departments behalf in 2020, $112,100 in 2021 and $109,971 last year.  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        Senate approves paper ballots bill Th e A rka n sa s S e n ate on Tuesday approved a bill that would establish requirements for counties removing electronic voting machines and relying on paper ballots marked and counted by hand. The Senate voted 21-6 to send Senate Bill 250 by Sen. Kim Hammer, R-Benton, to the House for further consideration. Six senators voted present and one senator didnt vote. The bill would require a county that chooses to use paper ballots in place of approved voting machines to be responsible for the cost of the paper ballots, and any devices or machines required for the printing and tabulation of paper ballots. SB250 would require each paper ballot to be compatible with the electronic vote tabulation devices selected by the secretary of state under Arkansas Code Annotated 7-5-301. During all elections in counties that use paper ballots and in which those ballots are counted by hand, the ballots would be required to first be marked using permanent ink and be run through an electronic vote tabulation device before a hand count is conducted under SB250. In January, the Cleburne County Quorum Court voted to remove voting machines from elections, making it a paper ballot county. The decision means votes must be hand counted in Cleburne County. At that time, officials with the Arkansas Voter Integrity Initiative Inc. said the vote was in response to a push by the leader of the group, retired U.S. Army Colonel Conrad Reynolds, for election computers to be removed from Arkansas elections. Reynolds, of Conway, lost bids for the Republican nomination in the 2nd Congressional District to U.S. Rep. French Hill of Little Rock in May of 2022 and to Hill in 2014. In December, Reynolds filed a lawsuit in Pulaski County Circuit Court against Secretary of State John Thurston, the state Board of Election Commissioners and Election Systems and Software (ES&S) aiming to prevent Arkansas from using specific voting machines in future elections. Sen. John Payton, R-Wilburn, told senators he worried the bill will lead to more voter distrust in the elections. But Hammer said “some people lose twice and they still cant accept it.” “Maybe I dont want to accept responsibility that I didnt run my race as good as I did. … Maybe I had polls run that told me what I wanted to hear instead of what I needed to hear,” he said. House panel OKs firearms carry bill A House panel on Tuesday approved a bill that would allow the concealed carry of handguns in Arkansas Department of Transportation buildings and on adjacent grounds. The House Committee on Judiciary advanced Senate Bill 211, by Sen. Missy Irvin, R-Mountain View, in a voice vote with audible dissent from lawmakers. The bill moves to the full House for further consideration. RJ Hawk, R-Bryant, the House sponsor of the bill, said the measure would allow people with enhanced concealed carry permits to bring firearms into buildings administered by the department. When enhanced concealed carry permits were established, holders were barred from carrying in several locations, including on state Department of Transportation property. Permit holders are allowed to carry on grounds administered by certain other state agencies. Current law prohibits permit holders from bringing firearms into courthouses, schools, law enforcement offices and other locations, Hawk said. Officials with the Department of Transportation had requested their agency be included in the list of permitted areas. The bill would allow employees who may carry weapons while out in the field to bring their firearms into administrative offices, Hawk told committee members.

        The State House Education Committee reconvened Tuesday afternoon to hear testimony from the public on Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders education overhaul plan, with more than 90 people signed up to speak on the bill. Cassandra Bone spoke for the legislation, saying public schools generally arent equipped to serve students with special needs, including her son. Bone said her child was able to attend Compass Academy in Conway, a private, non-profit school for children with developmental disabilities, thanks to a scholarship. “My child who was barely speaking is doing multiplication,” Bone said. “Every child should have the opportunity if they dont fit the mold.” Heath Bennett, superintendent of Haskell Harmony Grove School, opposed the bill, questioning how state officials would find the funding to cover its provisions. Bennett said the bills voucher program would do little to help students in his district who take more than two-hour bus rides to school. “Its very disheartening to listen to how public schools fail all the time,” he said. “If you look at my ACT scores, you may wonder how Im a superintendent. I was very blessed to have people who believed in me a long time ago. Thats what public schools do.” — Will Langhorne 11:34 a.m.: State House committee opens discussion of Sanders' education bill Members of the Arkansas House of Representatives had their first chance to weigh in on Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders education overhaul plan Tuesday morning before a large crowd at the state Capitol. Rep. Keith Brooks, sponsor of Senate Bill 294, also known as the LEARNS Act, presented the bill to members of the House Education Committee, calling it “the most aggressive” education package in the states history. The introduction was made before a packed hearing room in the large multi-agency complex known as Big MAC, where some onlookers were asked to leave because the crowd was over capacity. The bill calls for a phased-in voucher program that will provide 90% of per student state foundation funding for students to attend a private or home school and a $14,000 increase the starting salary for teachers. Rep. Brian Evans, chair of the House Education Committee, said the committee wouldn't take action on the bill Tuesday, and would instead debate and vote on the bill during a special order of business Wednesday. If approved by the committee, the full House could vote on the bill as early as Thursday, Evans said. The Senate approved the bill last week, but if approved by the House the legislation would have to move back to the Senate for a concurring vote before heading to the governor for action. Prior to public testimony, members of the committee asked Brooks and Education Secretary Jacob Olivia about what effect the bill will have on funding, rural school districts. Lawmakers asked how school districts will pay for the proposed $50,000 minimum salary for teachers. The bill also calls for the repeal of the Teacher Fair Dismissal Act, the state law that requires educators be given written notice before being fired. Brooks said an amendment that he filed Friday would add back in some due protections for teachers to have a hearing before being fired. Brooks said the repeal of the law would allow school districts to fire poor performing teachers. Rep. Steven Walker, R-Horseshoe Bend, asked how the school will evaluate “non-testing” teachers such as physical education and music teachers. Olivia said each school district will come up with ways to evaluate “non-testing” school districts. Rep. Ron McNair, R-Harrison, asked what input the public will have in the rule-making authority it prescribes for the Department of Education, saying it seems that only after the bills will bureaucrats and lawmakers determine how the bill will work. Brooks said the public will be a part of the rule-making process. — Neal Earley Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        Severe storms and a high possibility of strong and long-tracked tornadoes are predicted for much of Arkansas Thursday, forecasters said. The lower two-thirds of Arkansas is at an enhanced risk of severe weather, according to a Tuesday briefing from the National Weather Service.  An enhanced risk is defined by the weather service as several severe storms that will produce very large hail, damaging winds and/or tornadoes, a tweet from the service said.  “A concerning amount of instability and wind energy will fuel more numerous severe storms on Thursday and Thursday night,” the briefing said.  “The storm system moving in Thursday night has a higher potential for severe weather than weve seen in some time,” said Travis Shelton, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in North Little Rock. Storms on Thursday are predicted to have hail as big as baseballs, 80 mph winds or stronger and a high potential for tornadoes, Shelton said on Tuesday.  He said the storms will likely last until early Friday morning, with some rain possibly lingering into Friday.  The northern third of the state is at a marginal or slight risk for severe weather, meaning storms could still produce hail but it will be smaller and tornadoes are less likely, the weather service said.  Wednesday is also forecast to have scattered severe storms and a marginal or slight chance of severe weather for most of the state, Shelton said.  The tornado potential for Wednesday is very low, the briefing said. Winds could be as strong 60 mph and hail could be as big as a quarter.  “In addition to severe weather, several inches of rain are likely Wednesday through Thursday night. With the ground saturated in many areas, flash flooding is expected,” the briefing said.  Meteorologists said that ongoing river flooding, especially in the White River Basin, will worsen and other basins could experience new river flooding.  Shelton said that Little Rock could see up to half an inch of rain on Wednesday and anywhere between two to three inches on Thursday.  “There could be even more than that if strong storms move over the same place,” Shelton said.  The forecaster said that Arkansas drivers should be careful when driving on roads covered by water.  “Sometimes drivers are confident and think they know what they road looks like, but once water is covering it you cant know the road is still there,” Shelton said.   Matt Ramsey, a spokesman for Entergy, said that the electrical company is always “storm ready” and is watching the weather and planning to react.  “The weather is a funny thing and hard to predict but with as much wind and possibly tornadoes are involved they could knock tree limbs into lines and power poles and there could be outages,” Ramsey said.  He said crews were not allowed in bucket trucks to fix lines if winds were stronger than 25 to 30 mph.  “Once it is safe, we will have crews out there to fix any damage,” Ramsey said.  Both Ramsey and Shelton said that theyd recommend Arkansans preparing by getting a first aid kit with medical supplies, nonperishable food, a charged cell phone and water.  “Make sure you have a shelter or a place to go thats secure in case severe weather is in your area” Shelton said, “And make sure you have a way to receive weather alerts, whether that is your cell phone, television or weather radio.”  Shelton said some changes could be made to the forecast closer to Thursday and he encourages people check for updates frequently.  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         FORT SMITH -- University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences officials announced Tuesday an anonymous donor gave $600,000 to the school to continue providing contraception devices for uninsured post-partum patients in Fort Smith and Little Rock. Officials said in a news release the intrauterine devices and birth-control implants are inserted before a woman is discharged after giving birth to reduce unintended pregnancies and increase birth spacing. Insertions can cost more than $3,000 and aren't reimbursable by the state Medicaid program, according to the release. UAMS said the money is provided as part of the Increasing Equity and Access to Contraception in Arkansas Initiative. Last year, UAMS received $175,000 to supply the devices to 297 women at two birthing hospitals -- UAMS in Little Rock and Baptist Health in Fort Smith. This year, a UAMS team led by Dr. Nirvana Manning of the UAMS College of Medicine Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology intends to provide them to 449 patients in those facilities as well as the UAMS West Family Medicine Residency Program in Fort Smith. "This grant has been instrumental in not only providing access to contraceptive coverage that is in line with national recommendations but also in providing data that we hope will support the expansion to all patients, regardless of insurance coverage," Manning said. The money pays for the devices and the cost of insertion, as well as a focus on clinician training "to increase knowledge and create clinical champions within the hospital network," according to UAMS' application for the grant. The application said a study in South Carolina showed the use of the devices "was associated with decreased odds of a subsequent short-interval pregnancy."

        Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed an executive order Tuesday requiring a newly formed coalition of private-public entities to draft policies to address faults in Arkansas' foster care system. Under the order, Every Child Arkansas, a network of state agencies, faith-based organizations and foster care advocates, is tasked with finding ways to recruit more foster care parents, connect families with social services and create preventive strategies to keep children out of foster care, Sanders said during a news conference. "This executive order will have a major direct impact on the foster care system here in Arkansas," she said. "It's the first of many steps we're planning to take." By cutting processing times and speeding foster family licensing, Sanders expects the initiative to place children in homes in less than two months. The program also aims to increase the transparency of the foster care system and deputize a foster advocate to help foster families in each county, Sanders said. Lawmakers, advocates and foster families crowded the governor's conference room to watch Sanders and other officials affiliated with Every Child Arkansas deliver remarks. Before Sanders signed her order, Dr. Phil Goad, a member of the executive council for Every Child Arkansas, announced the official launch of the foster care network's website. "It will raise awareness of the need for foster care and adoptive families in our state," he said. "This magnificent new online resource will be telling encouraging stories of success and provide opportunities for Arkansans across the state to volunteer and learn more about foster care." The Every Child Arkansas network aims to ensure Arkansas has "more than enough" foster families, adoptive families and support for biological families, Goad said. The coalition includes state agencies within the Arkansas Department of Human Services and organizations such as CASA for Children, CarePortal, Children's Homes Inc., Project Zero and others.

         The Arkansas Senate State Agencies and Governmental Affairs Committee on Tuesday advanced a bill that would require the secretary of state to permit and arrange the placement on the state Capitol grounds of a suitable monument commemorating "unborn children aborted" during the era of the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court ruling under Roe vs. Wade. With Sen. Clarke Tucker, D-Little Rock, dissenting, the Senate committee sent Senate Bill 307 by Sen. Kim Hammer, R-Benton, to the full Senate. If enacted, the measure would be known as the "Monument to Unborn Children Display Act." The bill also would create a state trust fund to be known as the Monument to Unborn Children Display Act Fund. The fund would consist of gifts, grants and donations from individuals and organizations as provided under the bill and other funds as may be provided by law, and would be used only for erecting and maintaining the monument. The Capitol Arts and Grounds Commission would oversee the selection of the artist and design of the monument with input from pro-life groups under the bill, and the secretary of state would have final approval of the selection of the artist and design of the monument selected by the commission before any construction begins. Upon approval of the artist and design, the secretary of state would be required to arrange for the construction, placement and dedication of the monument on the state Capitol grounds by private entities at no expense to the state under the bill. If the legality or constitutionality of the monument is challenged in court, the attorney general may either prepare and present a legal defense of the monument, or request that a private law firm serve as counsel to prepare and present a legal defense of the monument under the bill.

        Arkansas and 14 of its cities will be allocated portions of roughly $44 million in annual grants for affordable housing, community development, and homeless assistance, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced Monday. The states funding is part of $5.6 billion HUD is distributing to 1,200 communities across the country. The money is targeted through five separate programs and not every city receiving grants will receive money from every program. Arkansas is only receiving funds through four of the programs. “Viable communities must promote integrated approaches to develop decent housing, suitable living environments, and expand economic opportunities to the most vulnerable,” said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge in a press release. “These funds allow communities to address their unique needs by prioritizing what matters most to their residents and letting them own their investments in community development through these important federal resources.” Arkansas is slated for $17.8 million via the Community Development Block Grants, an annual grant for states, cities, and counties for providing decent housing and a suitable living environment, and by expanding economic opportunities, principally for low- and moderate-income people. The 14 cities -- West Memphis, Texarkana, Springdale, Rogers, Pine Bluff, North Little Rock, Little Rock, Jonesboro, Jacksonville, Hot Springs, Fort Smith, Fayetteville, Conway and Bentonville -- will all receive funds from the grant, with Little Rock the only one receiving more a million dollars at $1.4 million. According to HUD, in 2022 the program helped more than 60,000 families through housing activities, 46,000 individuals through job creation or retention, 83,500 people experiencing homelessness through improvements to homelessness facilities, more than 5.3 million people through public services, and over 39 million people through public improvements. Arkansas is getting $10.5 million from the HOME Investment Partnerships Program. HOME is a tool used by states and local governments to produce affordable rental and owner-occupied housing for low-income families. HUD reported that in 2022 the program helped create more than 15,000 units of housing and nearly 17,000 households were assisted with tenant based rental assistance through HOME program. Pine Bluff ($268,888), North Little Rock ($396,150), Little Rock ($844,274), Fayetteville ($512,642) and Fort Smith ($462,538) are the only Arkansas cities also receiving HOME funding. Arkansas is receiving $2.3 million in Emergency Solutions Grants. This funding is dedicated for homeless shelters, assisting in the operation of local shelters, and funds related social service and homeless prevention programs. Each year, the program connects more than 350,000 people to emergency shelters as they transition to permanent housing. Arkansas ($1.4 million) and Little Rock ($1.03 million) will be allocated funds for Housing Opportunities for Persons With HIV/AIDS (HOPWA). The program provides stable and permanent housing assistance and supportive services to low-income people living with HIV. More than 100,000 households receive HOPWA housing assistance and/or supportive services annually. Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        <font size="4.4" face="arial" color="black">
        WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court has begun hearing arguments in a partisan legal fight over President Joe Biden's plan to wipe away or reduce student loans held by millions of Americans. The high court, with its 6-3 conservative majority, heard arguments on Tuesday on two challenges to the plan, which has so far been blocked by Republican-appointed judges on lower courts. Arguments were scheduled to last two hours but were likely to go much longer. The public can listen in on an outside link or the court's website. Twenty-six million people have applied, and 16 million have been approved to have up to $20,000 in federal student loans forgiven, the Biden administration says. The program is estimated to cost $400 billion over 30 years. “Im confident the legal authority to carry that plan is there,” Biden said on Monday, at an event to mark Black History Month. The president, who once doubted his own authority to broadly cancel student debt, first announced the program in August. Legal challenges quickly followed. Republican-led states and lawmakers in Congress, as well as conservative legal interests, are lined up against the plan as a clear violation of Biden's executive authority. Democratic-led states and liberal interest groups are backing the Democratic administration in urging the court to allow the plan to take effect. Without it, loan defaults would dramatically increase when the pause on loan payments ends no later than this summer, the administration says. Payments were halted in 2020 as part of the response to the coronavirus pandemic. The administration says a 2003 law, commonly known as the HEROES Act, allows the secretary of education to waive or modify the terms of federal student loans in connection with a national emergency. The law was primarily intended to keep service members from being worse off financially while they fought in wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Nebraska and other states that sued say the plan is not necessary to keep the rate of defaults roughly where it was before the pandemic. The 20 million borrowers who have their entire loans erased would get a “windfall” that will leave them better off than they were before the pandemic, the states say. Dozens of borrowers came from across the country to camp out near the court on a soggy Monday evening in hopes of getting a seat for the arguments. Among them was Sinyetta Hill, who said that Biden's plan would erase all but about $500 of the $20,000 or so she has in student loans. “I was 18 when I signed up for college. I didnt know it was going to be this big of a burden. No student should have to deal with this. No person should have to deal with this,” said Hill, 22, who plans to study law after she graduates from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee in May. Biden's plan could meet a frosty reception in the courtroom. The court's conservatives have been skeptical of other Biden initiatives related to the pandemic, including vaccine requirements and pauses on evictions. Those were billed largely as public health measures intended to slow the spread of covid-19. The loan forgiveness plan, by contrast, is aimed at countering the economic effects of the pandemic. The national emergency is expected to end May 11, but the administration says the economic consequences will persist, despite historically low unemployment and other signs of economic strength. In addition to the debate over the authority to forgive student debt, the court also will confront whether the states and two individuals whose challenge also is before the justices have the legal right, or standing, to sue. Parties generally have to show that they would suffer financial harm and benefit from a court ruling in their favor. A federal judge initially found that the states would not be harmed and dismissed their lawsuit before an appellate panel said the case could proceed. Of the two individuals who sued in Texas, one has student loans that are commercially held and the other is eligible for $10,000 in debt relief, not the $20,000 maximum. They would get nothing if they win their case. A decision is expected by late June.  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        Benton Police on Monday announced the arrest of a Hot Springs woman they believe was involved in the Jan. 15 hit-and-run that killed 13-year-old Zarious Evans of Benton. Jerrica Speed, 28, has been arrested and charged with leaving the scene of an accident involving death or serious injury, negligent homicide and obstructing governmental operations, a news release from the department said.  She was issued a $5,000 cash/sheriffs bond, the release said.  Authorities also said three juveniles are facing curfew violations and other misdemeanor charges related to the hit-and-run. The identity of the juveniles and information about the other charges were not immediately released.  Evans was found dead in the 19000 block of South Service Road just before 7 a.m. on Jan. 15, after police received a call about an unresponsive boy in the area, the release said.  A Jan. 17 news release identified Speed as the driver of the black Nissan Pathfinder involved in the crash and said she had contacted authorities about it.

         FAYETTEVILLE -- A rezoning proposal for about 15 acres on the northeast side of town gained support from the Planning Commission on Monday despite opposition from residents concerned about the environment, traffic and neighborhood character. Commissioners voted 5-2 to support rezoning 14.7 acres southeast of Oak Bailey Drive and Old Wire Road. The easternmost portion of the land includes the floodplain along Niokaska Creek. The City Council will have final say on the rezoning. If approved, it would change most of the land, about 9½ acres, from a residential single family zone allowing up to four units an acre to a neighborhood conservation zone. A neighborhood conservation zone allows the same residential uses as the current zone but with smaller lots, shorter setbacks from the right of way and higher density. The property could be developed under the current zoning with 32 dwellings, while rezoning to neighborhood conservation would allow up to 95 dwellings, said Donna Wonsower, city planner. The request also would realign the split zoning boundaries to match the floodplain, leaving 5.75 acres as undeveloped natural area. Mitch Weigel with Downtown Properties said the rezoning is intended to increase opportunities for housing in the city. Seven people spoke to the commission in opposition to the request, both in person and online. Mary Anne Kull, who lives nearby, said she didn't want to see the forested area lost and wanted to see an environmental impact study. "Our densely wooded paradise could be transformed into a dense development," she said. Commission Chairwoman Sarah Sparkman supported the request and said the land could already be developed under the current zoning. Many of the public concerns seemed to center around the land being developed at all, she said. "We need more housing in Fayetteville, and we cannot achieve it just by cramming it all into downtown and way off the dead end of Wedington," Sparkman said. "We have to look at other places closer to the center of town." Commissioners Andrew Brink, Mary McGetrick, Porter Winston and Matt Johnson joined Sparkman in supporting the rezoning. Commissioner Jimm Garlock voted against the rezoning and said he believed the request was not in line with the city's future land use map and was incompatible with existing nearby neighborhoods. Mary Madden joined him in voting against. Commissioner Joseph Holcomb recused from the vote. Commissioner Quintin Canada was absent Monday. In other business, commissioners voted 8-0 to approve a development plan for Pigskin RV Park on 43½ wooded acres southwest of Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and Finger Road. The plan includes 165 recreational vehicle parking stalls, community pool, pavilion, sports courts, playground, dog park and bathrooms. Taylor Lindley with Crafton Tull presented the proposal to the commission and said the Army Corps of Engineers and Federal Emergency Management Agency will inspect environmental aspects of the project. Farmington Branch, which is part of the Illinois River watershed, bisects the eastern portion of the site. Commissioners in October granted changes to the project's conditional land use permit that allowed additional amenities. Planning staff received public comment at the time expressing concerns over the impact to the environment, traffic and the potential for trespassers on nearby private property. Lindley said the project will have fencing around it, creating a sort of gated community. Additionally, commissioners split a pair of requests related to Cobblestone Farms, an attainable housing project northeast of Wedington Drive and 54th Street. The development plan for the project includes 108 residential units. The development plan expired, and the commission agreed to extend it for a year by an 8-0 vote. A second request involved removing a tree preservation area from the northeast portion of the site. Lindley presented both requests to the commission and said the tree preservation easement could pose complications for a future phase of development. The request to remove the tree preservation area from the project was denied 5-3. Holcomb, Sparkman, Johnson, Garlock and Madden voted to deny. Brink, Winston and McGetrick voted in favor. Commission action Fayetteville's Planning Commission met Monday and approved: A preliminary plan for eight homes on Cherry Street from Habitat for Humanity. A conditional land use permit for Scooter's Coffee to operate at 1519 S. School Ave. Rezoning just more than 2 acres on the west side of Gregg Avenue near Patricia Lane from residential multifamily up to 24 units an acre to allowing up to 40 multifamily units per acre.

        A bill intended to create criminal penalties for a person who knowingly remains in a bathroom of the opposite sex while a minor is present passed a Senate panel Monday. Senate Bill 270, by Sen. John Payton, R-Wilburn, advanced from the Committee on Judiciary in a 5-2 roll call vote. The panel's Democratic senators, Clarke Tucker of Little Rock and Stephanie Flowers of Pine Bluff, were the two detractors. The vote sends the bill to the full Senate for further consideration. Payton said his bill was needed to protect minors from being "exposed to something they shouldn't be exposed to." "It does not make it illegal to go into the wrong facility as assigned to your sex, but it does make it illegal to knowingly remain in there if there's a minor present," he said. Five people testified against the bill and one person spoke in favor of it. Opponents said the bill would create the most restrictive ban on bathroom use for transgender people in the nation while doing little to protect minors from sexual abuse. Critics also questioned how officials would verify an accused person's sex and enforce the bill's provisions. Payton said his bill does not specifically target transgender people but would also apply to "perverse heterosexuals." The legislation would generally criminalize instances where a person 18 or older knowingly "enters into and remains in a public changing facility that is assigned to persons of the opposite sex while knowing a minor of the opposite sex is present in the public changing facility." Under the bill, a person would be guilty of a misdemeanor the first two times they violated the section. Subsequent offenses would be classified as felonies, Payton said. Before the vote on the bill, Tucker said the measure was the latest example of the Legislature failing to "scrutinize bills in the manner that it should." He said the bill would put "going into a bathroom, using the bathroom and leaving" on par with existing state law intended to protect minors from acts of sexual abuse. "No, I don't think this bill is covering going into a bathroom, using the bathroom and leaving," Payton said. "It's choosing to use the wrong bathroom while minors are present." Payton noted that a minor may be exposed to persons in "a state of undress" in changing facilities. "If you're going to use the wrong facility, then you have a responsibility to make sure the other people are out of the way and are not exposed," he said. Sarah Everett, American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas policy director, said the legislation would be "the most extreme bathroom ban" in the nation if passed. "There is no other state that has a criminal ban against transgender people using the restroom whether or not a minor is present," she said. Everett noted the bill does not address criminal activity or intent to harm. In addition to affecting transgender people, the bill also could affect women who look masculine or have mastectomies, she said. When asked if he was aware of any instances where a child was threatened by someone using a bathroom intended for the opposite sex, Payton said he was not aware of any "on the public record." Some constituents have said it was a concern at restaurants and gas stations, he said. Rumba Yambu, executive director of Intransitive, a transgender support organization, said lawmakers should shift their focus to legislation aimed at protecting children from sexual assault by non-strangers. "I've worked with sexual assault survivors for years," he said. "It's always the same, whether they are children or adults, it's always someone close to them." Luke McCoy of the Family Council spoke for the bill, saying his organization had worked with Payton on the measure. "We think this a bill that could have been in use in previous situations, may be just a few, but nonetheless even if there aren't any this is a proactive bill," he said. Tucker questioned if criminal penalties would apply to a person who used a bathroom of the opposite sex and remained in the bathroom after a minor entered it. Payton said it would depend on the prosecutor's discretion and on how long the person remained in the restroom. "Even if you're sitting in a stall?" Tucker asked. In that instance, Payton said an attorney might claim the person was in a separate room. If a person is "behaving" themselves while in a restroom of the opposite sex, Payton said they would be unlikely to face prosecution under his bill. "It's going to be really hard for someone to prosecute you over this bill. You have to prove 'knowingly' and 'remains,'" he said. "It definitely is a tool in the toolbox for the prosecutor or for the employee or for the other patrons to demand somebody change their behavior and don't hang out in the bathroom." Jessica Disney, a transgender woman, spoke against the bill, saying transgender people already face harassment when appearing in public. "I've been followed into a restroom at the beginning of my transition by both men and women seeing me, demanding that I not continue walking forward or they would call the police on me or subject me to violence," Disney said. "I've had death threats sent to me and posted on the door of my own home because I am simply transgender." Tucker questioned how law enforcement and prosecutors might verify a person's sex if the person were accused of violating the provisions of Payton's bill. "In order to be prosecuted under this crime, will the defendant have to expose their sex organs," he asked. Payton said officials might draw blood from a defendant to test their chromosomes. Among other exceptions, the bill provides exemptions for parents accompanying minors, people rendering medical assistance, law enforcement officials accompanying a person in their custody and people authorized to maintain and inspect facilities. Another bill intended to restrict transgender people from using the bathroom of their choice at public schools was pulled from the Senate floor earlier this month to allow for amendment. House Bill 1156, by Rep. Mary Bentley, R-Perryville, would require public schools and open enrollment public charter schools to restrict people from using a restroom that does not correspond with the sex listed on their birth certificate.

        More public debate regarding Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders' proposed omnibus education bill is needed before it goes to a vote before the House of Representatives, leaders representing four state advocacy groups said Monday. Representatives of the Arkansas Public Policy Panel, Arkansas Citizens First Congress, Arkansas Education Association and Disability Rights Arkansas voiced concerns about Senate Bill 294, also known as the Arkansas LEARNS Act, and its quick journey through the Legislature during a news conference at the Arkansas Education Association building in Little Rock. "Combining all of these changes into one omnibus and rushing this legislation through so quickly makes it seem as though there's an effort to limit debate on perhaps the most sweeping overhaul of our state's education system in recent memory," said Olivia Gardner, education policy director with Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families. The 144-page bill was filed Feb. 20 and cleared the state Senate just four days later. The bill heads to the House Education Committee today for a public hearing and could pass the full House as early as Thursday. House Education Committee Chair Brian Evans, R-Cabot, said the committee will wait until Wednesday to take action. If voted out of the House on Thursday, the bill would have to head back to the Senate for a concurring vote before it goes to the Republican governor for her signature. "This is about accountability, transparency and collaboration," said Carol Fleming, president of the Arkansas Education Association. "Why do we have to push a bill through so quickly that has taken, as we've been told, two years to develop? So you've had two years to develop something you want to push through with less than a week's time to the public." All of the speakers on Monday said they agree with some parts of the bill and are pushing for it to be amended. Bill Kopsky, executive director of the Arkansas Public Policy Panel and Arkansas Citizens First Congress, said his group has a number of suggested amendments, including extending the bill's long list of mandates on public schools to private and charter schools. "There are components of this legislation that I will simply never agree with, but I do think even with that there are improvements that we can make to make this more palatable for folks," Gardner said. The bill's sponsor, Rep. Keith Brooks, R-Little Rock, filed an amendment late Friday afternoon that will add back some due process protections for teachers after the bill repeals the Teacher Fair Dismissal Act, the state law that requires educators be given written notice before being fired. Brooks' amendment would require school districts to issue a "notice of a recommendation for termination" for fired teachers and "an opportunity for a hearing before the public school district board of directors." The amendment, which came at the request of Sen. Kim Hammer, R-Benton, also includes language that requires a discussion of a "school safety assessment, to be done in a closed session." Brooks told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette on Monday that he has no plans to amend the bill further. When asked earlier whether Sanders was open to amending the bill further, Alexa Henning, a spokeswoman for the governor, said Sanders and the bill's sponsors "have been open to amending the bill throughout the process." "We took hundreds of edits based on feedback from legislators, teachers, administrators, and parents," Henning said in a statement Saturday. "We have been engaging legislators all week on improvements to the bill and yesterday the final amendment was filed." Kopsky said the public has been misled. "This bill is being sold as a public education bill about literacy, and that's not the way that we read the bill," he said. "We read the bill as actually not having very much to do with public education, other than dismantling an awful lot of it and privatizing it in the form of vouchers and a massive expansion of charter schools that we've not talked enough about." Kopsky said he saw two components of the bill that focus on literacy, and he said both are partially funded. "We think what this bill really is, is a school privatization bill," he said. "We should just call it that, and we should just peel out the parts around public education and run a separate 'improving public education' bill." Kopsky also said the bill contains a provision that would "coerce, encourage, really push schools that are rated D and F into entering into contracts with for-profit companies or private charter operators." He said that provision would affect more than 300 schools in the state that have a D or F rating, and that most of those schools are ranked so low because of poverty. "The largest indicator of a student's performance in school, by far, is family income," Kopsky said. He said overall the bill needs to focus on funding more evidence-based solutions and provide clear expectations about the long-term cost of reforms. During the bill's hearing in the Senate Education Committee, the bill's sponsor, Breanne Davis, R-Russellville, defended the legislation against charges that it is an attack on public education, saying "nothing about this bill defunds public schools." Instead, Davis pointed to financial data from the Department of Education showing $297 million in spending, with $150 million in new spending, that she said will go toward educating students. RURAL STUDENTS Fleming, with the Arkansas Education Association, said SB294 would hurt students attending rural schools. Even if a voucher covered their tuition, many of those students do not have transportation to schools other than the public school they are zoned to attend, she said, adding that those students would not benefit from the school choice that proponents of Arkansas LEARNS say it offers. Tom Masseau, director of Disability Rights Arkansas, also expressed concerns about transportation. He said alternate transportation, even ride-share programs, would not be accessible for all. Fleming pointed out the proposed bill did not benefit from educators' input, saying she contacted Sanders' campaign before Sanders was elected but has yet to meet with the governor. Fleming also noted the bill's lack of written support and pay raises for other school employees, including classroom support staff, nurses, nutrition workers, social workers and bus drivers. "Intent is all well and good, but if it's not written [in the bill] they don't have to be held accountable to it," she said. All four speakers agreed the $50,000 starting salary for teachers that would be implemented if the bill becomes law would place a financial burden on rural and small schools as well. Masseau said the proposed legislation does not include certain provisions for students with disabilities. More specifically, he said, it doesn't provide for the training of school resource officers in making threat assessments and responding to mental health crises. "We agree, at Disability Rights Arkansas, that we need a strong education system to provide for all Arkansans as they leave high school to pursue their hopes and dreams," Masseau said. "However, in reviewing the LEARNS bill proposed by Gov. Sanders and Senator Davis last week, those opportunities are not provided to students with disabilities." Gardner, with Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, said the bill fails to address early childhood education, too. "My work focuses on early childhood education, and I believe this bill does not go far enough to address the crisis facing our state," she said. "There is no money in this bill for increasing access and affordability for childhood education."

        CAMDEN -- Lockheed Martin has faced a surge in demand for its weapons because of the war between Russia and Ukraine, and the company is continuing a recruiting effort in south Arkansas to expand its workforce. The number of employees at Lockheed Martin's complex is set to eventually exceed 1,200, up from about 600 in 2018. Lockheed Martin faces competition for local talent, but Site Director for Camden Operations Aaron Huckaby said Monday the company anticipates increasing its staff by an additional 200 employees over the next five years. The area near Camden is home to the largest concentration of aerospace and defense companies in Arkansas, including Raytheon Technologies and Aerojet Rocketdyne. There are 100,000 potential workers living in a region that includes Camden, El Dorado and Magnolia, he said. "If you look at our historical record, we're very well positioned to meet the demand," Huckaby said. "So I don't feel that there's a lot of pressure on us to be able to meet it. I think that we're very well positioned to meet the demand either at 200 or if things increase, then we'll still be very well positioned." Russia's invasion of Ukraine a year ago heightened the call for Lockheed Martin's battlefield weapons systems. The company produces about four M270 Multiple Launch Rocket Systems per month, or 48 per year, with no current plans to increase that number, Huckaby said Monday during a media tour at the Camden facility. The company was producing 48 HIMARS, or High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, annually at the beginning of 2022, increasing that number to 60 units, until the U.S. Army asked the company to increase production capacity to 96 units per year -- eight units per month -- by the end of 2024. The company is well on its way to meeting that production target without necessarily hiring all 200 projected future employees just for HIMARS production, Huckaby said. Huckaby said the company is looking to add an additional shift on HIMARS production to meet the 96 annual unit goal. Current Department of Defense contracts have the Camden factory replenishing weapons stocks for the U.S. military and for U.S. allies, officials said, to cover for weapons already sent to the front lines in Ukraine. Some of the HIMARS trucks will go directly to Ukraine. The Camden facility currently operates one 10-hour shift a day, four days a week. "The second shift would be a night shift or an alternative shift, maybe a Friday through the weekend," Huckaby said. Ouachita Partnership for Economic Development Executive Director James Silliman said there have been more concerted efforts in recent years to increase a local pool of skilled workers who can work in aerospace and defense jobs in the area. "It's kind of a joint effort that we're all working on and trying to address, to increase that workforce here," Silliman said. "There's probably been more of a concerted effort than there has been in the past. Lockheed is expanding their facility footprint here to service different contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense, so as a result of that, there's kind of an ongoing effort to ramp up hiring," Silliman said. State government and economic development groups have recently been gathering feedback about how to retain and recruit employees for companies like Lockheed; housing is one issue, Huckaby said. "Highland Industrial Park is looking at being a partner within that solution, daycare is another thing you don't always think of," Huckaby said. Staffing at the Camden facility has roughly doubled over the past five years. There were 1,047 employees at the Camden facility at the end of 2022, up from 594 employees in 2018; 655 employees in 2019; 829 employees in 2020; and 974 employees in 2021. At the Camden facility, 45% of employees have an associate degree or higher and 12% have a military background. Thirty-four percent of Camden's assemblers are also female; women could be seen on the floor performing precision-focused jobs throughout the facility on Monday. "One thing a lot of people comment on is the number of female operators that we have out on the line, especially on our launcher side," Huckaby said. The company participates in recruiting efforts at Southern Arkansas University and the University of Arkansas. "[We are] looking for mechanical engineers, manufacturing engineers, chemical engineers that can fill that demand," Huckaby said. Lockheed Martin also hosts family engagement nights for K-12 students, and its Camden Manufacturing Apprentice Program started at Southern Arkansas University Tech in East Camden in 2020, which allows cross-training across production areas and programs. "We have a lot of different STEM activities that we do at all grade levels to draw that interest because we recognize not everyone wants to go to college, some people might have a career path right out of high school and we want them to have those opportunities," Huckaby said. Huckaby said these programs are about getting the message to Arkansas' youth that the image of manufacturing has changed. "It's just to show the kids at a very early age that this isn't a manufacturing that the other generations were accustomed to, it's very high tech, it's a very clean environment, and there's a lot of robotics and automation, things that speak to their passions." Lockheed Martin also works with nearby Louisiana Tech University in Ruston, La., to attract engineering students and support staff. Automation technology is also being used to improve efficiency and meet increased production demand in Camden. In October, Lockheed Martin announced the opening of a new 85,000-square-foot All-Up Round III facility to support increased production of PAC-3 missiles for the Patriot missile system, taking production from 350 to 500 missile segment enhancements. Assembly robots in the PAC-3 program have helped increase efficiency on the line.  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         FAYETTEVILLE -- The Advertising and Promotion Commission on Monday authorized leases for the historic Walker-Stone House and the Town Center. Commissioners voted 5-0 on a separate pair of proposals, one to lease the Walker-Stone House to Folk School of Fayetteville, and the other to renew the lease with the city for the Town Center. The lease with Folk School of Fayetteville is for $1 annually for two years. The lease for the Town Center is rent-free to the commission for 10 years with an automatic renewal every six months following expiration of the agreement. The commission bought the Civil War-era Walker-Stone House west of the downtown square in 2016. The city owns the Town Center and has leased it to the commission since 1998. The commission earlier this month discussed leasing the Walker-Stone House to Folk School of Fayetteville, the nonprofit group behind Fayetteville Roots. Commissioners supported the idea. Molly Rawn, chief executive officer of the city's tourism bureau, Experience Fayetteville, came back with a lease for commissioners to consider Monday. Bernice Hembree, one of the founders of Fayetteville Roots, last month described the idea for the property as being similar to Folk School of KDHX in St. Louis. Folk School of KDHX says on its website its mission is "to build community by providing educational programs that promote the learning, teaching, renewal and perpetuation of traditional music and folk arts." Under the agreement, Folk School of Fayetteville will pay $1 annually to rent the house starting Wednesday and lasting until Feb. 28, 2025. The commission agreed to pay up to $8,000 in utility costs -- specifically water, sewer, trash, electricity and gas -- for Folk School of Fayetteville for the first year, with the nonprofit group paying its own utilities in the second year. Additionally, Folk School of Fayetteville asked for first right of refusal for sale of the property. In other words, if someone makes an offer to the commission to buy the house, Folk School of Fayetteville could choose to buy the property first under the same terms. Commissioners agreed to give Folk School of Fayetteville 10 business days to consider such an offer if one were to happen. Rawn said she is not looking to put the house on the market, but the commission would need to consider any significant offer it might receive as good stewards of taxpayer money. The commission receives half of the city's 2% hotel, motel and restaurant sales tax revenue, with the other half going to parks. The commission authorized Rawn to present the proposal for first right of refusal to Folk School of Fayetteville and sign it if the nonprofit agrees to the terms. Separately, the commission will provide Folk School of Fayetteville $30,000 to cover startup programming costs. The money will be given in two installments. The first $15,000 will be provided once the lease is finalized. The other $15,000 will be provided after Folk School of Fayetteville presents an operating plan to the commission. The lease between the city and commission for the Town Center is largely the same, Rawn said. Under the new agreement, the leases for the Town Center and the center's parking deck will become one. Merging the two leases will make them easier to manage, she said. Additionally, repairs and upgrades for major features of the Town Center, such as the roof and air-conditioning units, will be the city's responsibility. The commission will continue to be responsible for routine maintenance and utility costs. The commission recently negotiated with the city to upgrade the center's roof so solar panels could be installed. The new lease also clarifies the terms regarding duration and renewal. Either party can call a meeting to propose changes to the agreement over the course of the 10 years. The lease will automatically renew with the same terms every six months if no action is taken, said Taylor Kelley, outside counsel to the commission. The language in the original lease was unclear and no one noticed it had expired more than a year ago, she said. Commission Chairman Todd Martin said he wasn't thrilled with some of the language of the new agreement but supported it overall. "I feel like this is a very good outcome for the A&P Commission," he said. The City Council is tentatively scheduled to discuss the Town Center lease March 21.

         FAYETTEVILLE -- Washington County's justices of the peace will be looking at up to $20 million in requests for federal covid relief money, with the county having earmarked just $2.3 million in funding. The Quorum Court's County Services Committee on Monday heard a report on the initial review of applications for funding from the American Rescue Plan Act. The panel took no action on the requests. County Judge Patrick Deakins said his office will be sending out more detailed information on the requests to the justices of the peace beginning today. The county received about $46 million in American Rescue Plan Act funds. The Quorum Court agreed last year to make available about $2.3 million in funding to nongovernmental groups and set up an application process. The application period closed at the end of October, and the applications received were sent to the Northwest Arkansas Economic Development District in Harrison to be reviewed for eligibility for the federal funds. According to information from the county, there were 46 applications received during the process with the total amount requested approaching $30 million. Catherine Baker with the Northwest Arkansas Economic Development District, said the district narrowed the applications down to 11 that met the guidelines of their review. Those 11 applications included requests totalling about $20 million. The initial applications ranged in size from $10,000 to more than $8 million and come from long-established charities like the Ronald McDonald House and the Lions Club to organizations including the Washington Water Authority, which submitted four requests ranging from $2.4 million to more than $8 million. The Washington Water Authority's requests total about $20 million. The distribution process for the American Rescue Plan Act funds was a bone of contention for several months with some nonprofit groups noting the Quorum Court awarded money to some groups without any process in place to accept and evaluate requests. The county allocated about $2.9 million to Upskill NWA for a job-training program to address shortages of qualified employees in health care and another $315,000 to Returning Home, a Springdale nonprofit group helping men who have been incarcerated reintegrate with the community. The use of relief funding for an expansion of the county's Detention Center has also raised questions. The justices of the peace in December approved two ordinances appropriating about $18.8 million in relief money for an expansion of the Detention Center. Some justices of the peace and community activists have questioned whether the jail project is an eligible use for the funds. A petition drive aimed at blocking the two spending ordinances failed to gather enough signatures in the allotted time to force a special election on the ordinances. Also on Monday, the justices of the peace discussed the need for a county emergency operations center. John Luther, the county's emergency services director, told the justices of the peace the office is now housed in a temporary location in Lincoln, using a satellite training facility of the Arkansas Fire Academy. Luther said the county had an emergency operations center in what is now the Northwest Arkansas Crisis Stabilization Unit. When that building was designated for use for the crisis stabilization unit, his office and the emergency operations center were moved to the county's annex building, but that space is now being used by Circuit Judge Diane Warren. Luther said Washington County stands alone among the state's larger counties in having no permanent emergency operations center. He said the center is used to bring together and coordinate different agencies and governments in time of emergencies like tornadoes or flooding. The center would be used at other times for training and to provide conference and office space. "The center is the hub of business related to emergencies," Luther said. "It helps the responders do the jobs they need to do out in the field." Luther said an emergency operations center should have room to house all of the local emergency response agencies and additional space for state or federal agencies that may need to have people in the county to deal with an emergency situation. Deakins said the county needs to address the issue of having no permanent facility for emergency management and after some discussion told the justices of the peace he saw enough of a consensus among them to begin working on the project. The justices of the peace took no action on the matter Monday.  American Rescue Plan Act Washington County received more than $46 million in American Rescue Plan Act money in 2021 and 2022. The American Rescue Plan provides $350 billion in federal money for eligible state, local, territorial and tribal governments nationwide to offset the impact of the covid-19 pandemic, according to information from the Treasury Department.

        Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders will appoint obstetrician-gynecologist Kay Chandler to serve as Arkansas' next surgeon general, Sanders announced Monday. Chandler has served as an obstetrician-gynecologist at Cornerstone Clinic in Little Rock since 1997 and has been included on the national Best Doctors Inc. list since 2005, the governor's office said in a news release. Sanders said Chandler will bring strong leadership and years of medical expertise to the state Department of Health. "Dr. Chandler is a skilled, qualified OB-GYN who has spent decades serving women across Arkansas," the Republican governor said in a news release. "I promised that when I was elected governor, Arkansas would not have mask mandates or vaccine mandates and we would not shut down churches and schools because we believe in personal freedom and responsibility," Sanders said. "I look forward to working together to protect the health, well-being and individual freedoms of Arkansans." Chandler replaces the state's former surgeon general, Greg Bledsoe, who submitted his resignation to Department of Health interim Secretary Renee Mallory in a letter dated Friday. "It has been my privilege to serve the people of Arkansas as the surgeon general for this wonderful state these past eight years," Bledsoe wrote in his letter to Mallory. "Wishing you and your colleagues at the Arkansas Department of Health all the best as you continue to work on behalf of our state to further health and health care for all Arkansans." Former Gov. Asa Hutchinson, a Republican, appointed Bledsoe as the state's surgeon general in 2015. Bledsoe was part of state government's response to the covid-19 pandemic in 2020, warning Arkansans in late March to take the virus seriously by social distancing and quarantining as necessary. In May 2022, Bledsoe lost a bid for the Republican nomination for lieutenant governor to current Lt. Gov. Leslie Rutledge, who is the state's former attorney general. Bledsoe announced his resignation on Twitter on Friday afternoon, saying, "I wish [Gov. Sanders] & her admin. tremendous success as they lead our state. I know they will do an excellent job." He had a $173,199 management consulting contract with the state Department of Health for the current fiscal 2023, according to the Arkansas Transparency website. Bledsoe said Monday in a text message to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette that he is the medical director of the emergency department at St. Mary's Regional Health System in Russellville, and the chief executive officer of ExpedMed, a medical education company that directs the Expedition Medicine National Conference. Chandler has been named the best obstetrician-gynecologist by Little Rock Family Magazine and AY Magazine, according to the governor's office. She graduated with a bachelor's degree in chemistry from Hendrix College, received her doctor of medicine degree from University of Texas Southwestern Medical School in Dallas, and completed her residency training at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. Chandler is dedicated to promoting health and wellness through true lifestyle change and has served as medical director of Ideal Health NOW! since 2011, according to the governor's office. She shares new women's health care information on the medical Monday segment on THV11's morning show, "THV This Morning," and currently serves on the board for the Pulaski County Medical Society and on the board of trustees of the Arkansas Medical Society. She is married to her husband of 30 years, dentist Jeffrey K. Chandler, who serves the Little Rock area at Chandler Family Dentistry.  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         FAYETTEVILLE -- A Tennessee man pleaded not guilty in Washington County Circuit Court on Monday to robbing a Fayetteville bank in January. Danny Ray Madison, 57, of Nashville, Tenn., was arrested in connection with the Jan. 10 robbery, according to information from the Fayetteville Police Department. Madison is charged with aggravated robbery and theft of property, according to court documents. He was given an initial court date of July 5 before Circuit Judge Mark Lindsay. Officers were called to First Security Bank at 3443 W. Wedington Drive at 8:39 a.m. Jan. 10, according to police. Madison went into the bank and took an undisclosed amount of money before leaving, police said. He threatened bank employees with a gun and kept one hand in his pocket, according to a preliminary report. He handed an employee a bag and demanded money from both of the bank tellers' cash drawers, the report said. Madison left the bank and walked through the parking lot near the Walmart Neighborhood Market just south of the bank, police said. Officers began a search of the area, and an employee at a nearby motel said he believed a man matching the photograph taken during the robbery had been there the previous night. He identified the man as Madison. Madison was found on surveillance video from the Jefferson Bus Lines building at 3075 W. Wedington Drive. A clerk at the bus terminal said Madison had been in the building asking about a bus ticket. The clerk said Madison left the bus station in a taxi but left a backpack at the bus station. Police said investigators began watching the bus station and saw a taxi enter the parking lot with Madison inside. Madison entered the bus station and was taken into custody. Police said Madison was wearing clothing that matched those in the bank robbery photos and had a large amount of cash in his pockets. Police said Madison admitted to investigators he robbed the bank on Wedington Drive, and he had come to Fayetteville with the purpose of robbing a bank. According to the report, Madison told police he had told the bank clerks he had a gun but didn't actually have one during the robbery. Police said Madison has a history of other bank robberies with prior convictions in 1995, 2002 and 2012.

        It was pharmacist Gwendolyn Herzig's first time testifying before a legislative committee when she spoke to several Arkansas lawmakers in a packed hearing room this month about a bill restricting gender-affirming care for minors. Herzig, who is transgender, spoke against the legislation and told the panel that one of the biggest obstacles trans people face is a lack of empathy. A few minutes later, a Republican lawmaker asked her a question about her genitalia. "It was horrifying," Herzig said. The exchange, which was livestreamed on the Legislature's website and has since been widely shared on social media, is an example of the type of questions and rhetoric that transgender people meet when they show up to statehouses to testify against new bills targeting their rights. In South Dakota, a lawmaker invoked "furries" -- people who dress up as animals -- when talking about gender-affirming care. In Montana, a legislator compared parents supporting their children in finding treatment to asking doctors to carry out medically assisted suicide. Advocates worry that increasingly hostile rhetoric about transgender people could have a chilling effect on those who want to speak out against new restrictions and could do lasting damage to a community of trans youth that is already marginalized. "I feel like that's what they're trying to do, to keep us from coming and exercising this right that we have," said Rumba Yambu, executive director of Intransitive, an advocacy and support group for transgender people in Arkansas. "Because who wants to go and be asked about their genitalia in front of a bunch of strangers? Especially strangers in power." So far this year, at least 150 bills targeting transgender people have been introduced nationally, which is the highest in a single year, according to the Human Rights Campaign. Bans on gender-affirming care for minors have already been enacted this year in South Dakota and Utah, and Republican governors in Tennessee and Mississippi are expected to sign similar bans into law. Arkansas and Alabama have bans that were temporarily blocked by federal judges. The push has included efforts in some states to restrict gender-affirming care for adults and proposed bans on drag shows that opponents have warned would also discriminate against transgender people. Herzig came to the state Capitol to testify against a bill that would make it easier to file malpractice lawsuits against providers of gender-affirming care to minors. In her testimony, Herzig talked about working with transgender patients who are on hormone replacement therapy. "Bills like SB199 are designed to hinder, not help, Arkansans by creating barriers to evidence-driven health care they deserve under the guise of helping the young and innocent," Herzig said, later adding that a vote for the bill was "unpatriotic, and casts doubts on our own health and research institutions who have worked through health care fields to improve the lives of Americans." During follow-up questions, Republican Sen. Matt McKee asked Herzig if she is transgender. When she said yes, he asked: "Do you have a penis?" The question was met with jeers and audible gasps in the packed committee room. "That's horrible," Herzig responded, telling McKee that asking her such a question was inappropriate and noting she was testifying as a health care professional. "I had never been so publicly humiliated in my life," Herzig told The Associated Press in an interview days later. McKee did not respond to an email or phone call, but defended his question in a written statement. "As a father of 4 daughters, I will do everything in my power to protect my children and the children of Arkansas, especially from the woke mob who intend to push their agenda and beliefs down our throats and destroy our families," McKee's statement said. The idea of protecting children by withholding medical care is undermined by health experts who have said minors with gender dysphoria who do not receive appropriate care face dramatically increased risk of suicide and serious depression. McKee's questions were similar in tone to those posed to Debi Jackson's teen Avery, who is transgender and nonbinary, when they testified before Missouri legislators last year about a proposal to ban trans girls and women from participating on sports teams matching their gender identity. During the hearing, a lawmaker asked Avery if they were "gonna go through the procedure." Since that exchange, Jackson said Avery hasn't wanted to testify again before the Legislature. "It's this same idea that in any of these discussions about trans people just being treated with basic dignity and respect, legislators want to reduce them to one body part," Jackson said. "They miss the entirety of the human being sitting in front of them having a conversation." Advocates say the rhetoric surrounding these proposed bans further exacerbates the problem of an already treacherous environment for transgender people, their families and medical providers. Children's hospitals around the country have faced an uptick in harassment and threats of violence for providing gender-confirming care. Though she said she's received an outcry of support since her testimony, Herzig said she and the pharmacy she owns have gotten hateful emails and calls. People opposed to gender-affirming care for minors argue that children are too young to make decisions about their futures, sometimes comparing such treatments to child abuse. That's despite medical experts' saying the care is safe when administered properly. Nearly every major medical group, including the American Medical Association, has opposed the bans on such care for minors. Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott last year ordered the state's child welfare agency to investigate reports of gender-affirming care for children as abuse, but a judge has since blocked those investigations. Amber Briggle, the mother of a transgender teenager in Texas whose family was investigated after Abbott's order, said she gets frustrated when speaking before lawmakers in her state who she believes already have made up their minds on the issue. But Briggle said she plans on returning to Texas' Capitol this year, and that Herzig's encounter motivates her even more to show up and speak out. "They should not have to fight this alone," Briggle said of transgender people testifying in statehouses. "They should know they have loving, supporting allies in their corner." Herzig said she probably would not have testified had she known she was going to be asked about her genitalia. "I felt like I was pretty much prepared for any combative question," she said. "Except that."  Print Headline: Trans people face 'horrifying' rhetoric at statehouses Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.
