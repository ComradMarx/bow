        The family of Quintin Miller, the 17-year-old killed in a Camden shooting last week, held a press conference on the lawn of the Ouachita County Courthouse Wednesday afternoon, calling for justice and harsher sentences for the individuals allegedly involved in the shooting. Ebony Gulley, who is a public defender and a family member of Miller said, "We're here for a very serious matter. Exactly one week ago today, the life of Quintin Miller was tragically stolen from him, his family and this community. The probable cause affidavit reads that 'at approximately 3:15 officers (responded)' ... That means that exactly seven days ago, at this exact moment, Quintin was fighting to live. He did not survive." Quintin's father, Torrey Miller, called for Prosecutor Margaret Wynne to seek first-degree murder charges in the shooting. Camden Police Sergeant Ashley Watts, when asked about the investigation, said, "We're still investigating. Everything is still being looked into right now." Gulley ended the press conference saying that, as a public defender, she has recused herself from representing two suspects allegedly involved in the shooting and reiterated the call for more serious charges against them. She opened the conference by saying the family held it to talk about who Quintin is, not who he was. Bishop Robert Arnold delivered a prayer and spoke about mentoring Quintin in Camden Public Schools. Miller's sister Trinity Clary said, "Quintin was a very genuine and positive person. He never got into any trouble in school or any trouble outside of school. If you knew him, you knew he had such a beautiful spirit, and he was a respectful young man. What happened to him due to this fatal altercation is downright disgusting to me." Clary added, "We are pressing for maximum charges and the correct punishment for the young men who did this and who were involved in this fatal altercation." Another sister, Karissma Clary, stated, "My brother Quintin was such a genuine, kind-hearted person, so laid back and cool, wouldn't hurt a soul but would stand on what's right. Quintin had dreams and his whole life ahead of him, and all that was taken away from him too soon. He loved playing football. He was just telling me that he made varsity team. He was so excited to start back playing football again." She spoke of Miller's aspirations to get his commercial driver's license and open a trucking company to earn money for his family. Karissma also said, "I would like to respectfully speak on [Camden Police Department] -- my family and I would love to get more and better updates on this case. We feel we have the right to know." Watts also invited anyone with information to call the Camden Police Department. Jada Sims, another of Quintin's sisters, asked anyone with information on the shooting to report it to police and said a bank account in her name at Generations had been opened up to help with funeral costs for the family. Quintin's father, Torrey Miller said, "No parents should ever have to experience this or go through this. We're here to speak about Quintin -- the beacon of bright light he was and is. He won't be forgotten... He was a hero to me. He was a better man than me at age 17. I feel like I let him down. I feel like I broke a promise to him."

         Three members of a Hot Springs drug trafficking organization were sentenced Tuesday in Hot Springs to federal prison terms of 10, 15 and almost 20 years, respectively, for crimes related to meth distribution, according to a news release from U.S. Attorney David Clay Fowlkes of the Western District of Arkansas. Jose Luis Aguilar, 61, and Eric Alexi Aguilar, 25, both of Houston, Texas, were each indicted on one count of conspiracy to distribute meth and one count of aiding and abetting in the possession with the intent to distribute 500 grams or more of a mixture or substance containing meth. James Franklin Wells Jr., 60, of Hot Springs, was indicted on one count of possession with intent to distribute more than 50 grams of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of meth. Jose Aguilar was sentenced to 19 years and seven months followed by five years of supervised release; Eric Aguilar was sentenced to 10 years followed by five years of supervised release; and Wells was sentenced to 15 years followed by four years of supervised release. All three will have to serve 85% of their sentences before they are eligible for parole. All three were sentenced Tuesday in U.S. District Court, by Chief Judge Susan O. Hickey. According to court documents, in 2020, DEA agents began investigating a drug trafficking organization operating within the Western District of Arkansas, Hot Springs Division. During the course of their investigation, they identified Jose Aguilar as the leader of this group, and said he regularly supplied narcotics to multiple dealers in the Hot Springs area between July 29, 2020, through at least Sept. 25, 2020. The DEA, Homeland Security Investigations Little Rock, the Hot Springs Police Department, the 18th Judicial District East Drug Task Force and the Garland County prosecutor's office investigated the case, which was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Bryan Achorn and Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Trent Daniels.

         Visit Hot Springs has released the lineup for the "First Ever 20th Annual World's Shortest St. Patrick's Day Parade." It's a mix of new entries and longtime crowd favorites that includes floats, bands, dancers, strutters, leprechauns and "assorted wacky participants." The entry deadline for parade participants was Wednesday, but the lineup was filled ahead of the deadline, Alexis Hampo, special events manager for Visit Hot Springs, said in a news release. "We have some really exciting entries this year," Hampo said. "Some have been participating in the parade for years and others are brand new to Bridge Street. I am thrilled to see all the creative, green and St. Pat's-themed floats and groups coming to celebrate the 20th year of our tiny and wonderful parade." New this year will be the Rusty Nail Line Dancers, a square dance group. "We are very excited to be participating in the parade," Tonja Bolding said in the release. "Five of the dancers were in the parade approximately 10 years ago with our original teacher, who unfortunately is recovering from multiple strokes. We want to dedicate this experience and our performance to our beloved Jerri Hendrix Priddy. I now teach this class out of love, respect and admiration for her and everything she taught me." The Spa City St. Paddy Wagon, famous for throwing hamburgers to the crowd, is also returning. "It has been a privilege to be a part of the annual World's Shortest St. Patrick's Day Parade. The families on our float have gotten to see our children enjoy the tremendous thrill of tossing thousands of items and hundreds of hamburgers over the past five years to our wonderful community of Hot Springs," Paddy Wagon's Dennis P. Berry said in the release. "We have gotten more thrills and great memories than we ever imagined, and we can't wait to unveil the new Spa City St. Paddy Wagon." Perennial parade favorite the International Order of the Irish Elvi (Hot Springs Chapter), a group of Irish-themed Elvis impersonators, is also returning with "A Smorgasbord of Elvi." New entries include The Cousin O'Eddies, a tribute to the Randy Quaid character Cousin Eddie from "National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation," with the Central High School Kiltie Drum and Bugle Corps from Springfield, Mo., an all-female kilt-wearing marching group that is the oldest such outfit in the nation. The final lineup for the 20th Annual Parade, which will be held March 17 on Bridge Street, includes the following:  A free public concert will be held on the Bridge Street Stage immediately following the parade, by The Molly Ringwalds. On Saturday, March 18, the "Second Ever Zero-K World's Shortest St. Patrick's Footrace," starting on Bridge Street and going 299 feet to O'Kelley's World's Biggest Inflatable Irish Pub across the street, will be held in the afternoon, followed by a free public concert on the Bridge Street Stage by the 1970s band Village People in the evening.

         Two Republican and two Democratic justices of the peace defeated a resolution Monday declaring Garland County a pro-life county. The bipartisan majority comprised Democrats Thomas Anderson, District 2, and Esther Dixon, District 3, and Republicans Jason Braziel, District 8, and Larry Raney, District 13. The Public Health, Welfare and Safety Committee's 4-3 vote was unusual for the quorum court. Most items that come before it in committee advance to the full body by acclimation and don't require a roll call. Levying property taxes, appropriating funds for county government, setting salary ranges and personnel policy for county employees are the quorum court's usual purview. Monday night's foray into a controversial social issue was unfamiliar territory. The bipartisan majority questioned why the court would consider such an item, especially in light of the acrimony it caused at Monday night's hearing. "That's not what we need in our county," Braziel said. "I'm as much for the rights of pro-life as anybody, but I don't think that's really our job here tonight." Dixon concurred. She was the only woman elected to the 2019-20 and 2021-22 quorum courts. The current court's other woman, JP Debbie McGrew, R-District 10, was part of the 4-3 minority that supported the resolution. "This resolution is outside the boundaries of our duties, responsibilities and our authority," Dixon said. While JPs on both sides of the issue found consensus, the standing-room-only county courtroom was divided. Close to two dozen people spoke during the public comment period, most in opposition to the resolution. Their words sparked displays of approbation and disapproval from the gallery, prompting several pleas for decorum from Chairman Raney. "Please do not react," he said. "This is not a performance. This is a hearing. We're not here to have you boo." BN Braughton's comments elicited one of the more full-throated reactions of the evening. "If you terminated a pregnancy, you killed your own child," the chairman of the county's Young Republicans Committee said. The comment came after several women told JPs they had gotten abortions or chose to continue pregnancies despite knowing their children would lead lives of dependency. "Having a baby with a genetic defect is challenging, expensive and never-ending," Jane Browning, whose son, Paul, was born with Down syndrome, said. "In retrospect, I would always choose to continue my pregnancy, but I would never have the audacity to make that decision for any other woman." Resolutions are statements of opinion that carry no authority, but some speakers said words can embolden people into action. "This rhetoric matters," said the wife of an OB-GYN, "These words give people power, and that power could make someone come and hurt my family." The resolution presumed the county had reached a consensus on the abortion issue, said many who opposed it. They asked its sponsor, JP Dayton Myers, R-District 7, for the basis of his declaration. "The people of Garland County are pro-life," he said. "You can tell by the people who were elected." Myers was referring to the quorum court's Republican majority, which grew to 10-3 after Micah Braughton defeated five-term incumbent Democrat Dave Reagan for the JP1 seat in November. He said the party's prominence on the court showed the majority of the county agreed with the Republicans' pro-life platform and statement of principles its county committee requires local candidates to sign. Myers talked about the need for a pro-life resolution during the three-way Republican primary for the JP7 seat. A deputy grandknight in the local Knights of Columbus Council, Myers led the Catholic fraternal organization's effort to bring a baby box to the city of Hot Springs' Central Fire Station. The state's Safe Haven Act allows parents to anonymously surrender newborns 30 days or younger to a medical provider, law enforcement agency or fire department and face no criminal liability. "I think the behavior of the people here has shown we've allowed them to come speak, and they've repeatedly ignored the rules we've set out," Myers said. "I've enjoyed hearing from every one of y'all, but I don't see any reason why we shouldn't give this a do pass." Raney thanked the audience, telling them he wished they would take a similar interest in other issues that come before the court. "I want to thank each and every one of you for coming and speaking to us," he said. "It's very important that we hear what you have to say. I just wish that we could fill this courtroom like this when we're dealing with other issues that are just as important." Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        The House Education Committee moved forward Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders' education overhaul Wednesday, sending the bill to the House of Representatives. The committee approved the bill on a voice vote, and it will head to the House floor for a vote today, House Speaker Matthew Shepherd said. The committee's vote comes after seven hours of public testimony Tuesday with 94 members of the public signing up to speak for and against the bill during the hearing. "My signature Arkansas LEARNS is headed to the House floor," Sanders tweeted after the committee's vote. "I am not interested in being a caretaker of the failed status quo -- I vowed to be [a] change-maker for the people. We are one step closer to huge, transformational education reform that will impact generations of Arkansans." The Republican governor has described Senate Bill 294 as her top legislative priority since taking office in January. The 144-page bill is an omnibus package that Sanders said is "the most bold, comprehensive, conservative education reform package in the nation." The bill includes a phased-in voucher program to attend a private or home school. It also calls for a $14,000 increase in the starting salary for teachers and funding for literacy coaches to boost reading levels for elementary students. With 54 of 100 House members listed as co-sponsors, it is likely the House will pass the bill today. If approved by the House, the LEARNS Act would move back to the Senate for a concurring vote before heading to the governor's desk for her signature. "I believe this is a compromise bill," said Rep. Brit McKenzie, R-Rogers. "I think that there are things that we can take back to teachers, we can take back to students, we can take back to our parents, we can take to our administrators, and albeit, it's not the best bill. It is the best bill for our students." Perhaps the most contentious part of the bill is the proposed voucher program, called Educational Freedom Accounts, which will allow students to use 90% of foundation funding from the previous school year to go toward a private or home school. For the 2022-2023 school year, foundation funding per student was $7,413. The voucher program will be phased in over three years, beginning in the 2023-2024 school year for students in F-rated schools; enrolled in kindergarten; who were or are in a foster care program; who have a disability; or who have an active-duty military parent. For the 2024-2025 school year, the voucher program will expand to students attending a D-rated school; who have a parent who is a military veteran; or who are children of first responders. By the 2025-2026 school year, every student who is eligible to enroll in a public school will be eligible for a voucher to attend a private or home school. For Sanders, the voucher program is a way to help students in struggling school districts not be trapped by their ZIP code, by letting the state funds for public schools also be used on a private or home school education. During a hearing Tuesday, some parents said private and home schools could provide the type of intensive care and education public schools cannot provide to many special needs children. For many, the bill is an aggressive attempt to reform education in Arkansas, which lags behind the national average in reading and math scores. "Ultimately when you look at the bill in its entirety, what we all want is to finally do something that will take our state from the bottom of the rankings, where we are year after year, and deliver something big and bold for Arkansas and for the students," said Rep. Grant Hodges, R-Centerton. Critics contend vouchers would drain funding from public schools, many of which are already underfunded and under-resourced. Opponents of the bill also said public schools, unlike private schools, do not have the option of turning away students and holding the schools to similar standards is unfair. Others argued that vouchers would only partially cover tuition for private schools and would mostly benefit middle- and upper-class families who already have funds to afford a private education. Rep. Denise Garner, D-Fayetteville, took issue with the bill's voucher program, saying studies have shown they do not work. "Vouchers do not support students with disabilities, and it does exacerbate segregation, skirt accountability and transparency, funds discrimination and leaves underserved students and communities behind," Garner said. Others pointed to what they saw as a rushed process that they contend did not include enough input from teachers and administrators while the bill was being crafted. Last week, the Senate approved the bill with one Republican, Sen. Jimmy Hickey Jr., of Texarkana, voting "no," saying he was not given enough time to read the bill. The bill was filed Feb. 20 and passed by the Senate three days later. "It won't be even within two weeks that this bill was made available to the public, made available to educators, education administration, parents and, obviously, you've heard plenty enough testimony that it is not enough time for anyone," Rep. Vivian Flowers, D-Pine Bluff, said Wednesday. The $50,000 starting salary mandated by the bill would boost Arkansas to near the top in the country in minimum pay for educators and offer $2,000 raises to those making more than the minimum and $10,000 in bonus pay for high test scores or teaching in a geographic or subject area of high need. However, the bill also would repeal the state's minimum salary schedule for educators and the Teacher Fair Dismissal Act, a law that requires notice before a teacher can be fired. The bill also includes provisions for teacher recruitment, literacy coaches and tutors, a new diploma track for high school students who want to focus on studying a trade, enhanced security measures for schools and codification of Sanders' executive order banning Critical Race Theory. An amendment to the bill added back in language requiring teachers to be given "an opportunity for a hearing" in front of the school board before they can be fired. Before Wednesday's vote, committee members took turns reflecting on Tuesday's hearing, with several of those who voted for the bill saying they thought the process was rushed and the bill could be improved. Rep. Keith Brooks, the bill's House sponsor, told committee members during his closing remarks that the LEARNS Act was a "great starting point" and that they could continue to work through the session to better public education in Arkansas. "I think we have to remember LEARNS is not the end of the conversation, even in this legislative session," said Brooks, R-Little Rock. "It doesn't mean it's the end of the things we're going to do in education, the things we're going to do to impact our kids, the things we're going to do to consider the needs of teachers and people all over the state of Arkansas." The idea the bill could be further altered after its passage, if needed, was persuasive for some Republicans who said they had doubts about the bill. "I've had fears. I've had doubts," said Rep. DeAnn Vaught, R-Horatio. "I've had questions about this bill, but I'm trusting the sponsor that if there's problems with the bill and there's things that need to be changed that we'll work together to make sure that they get addressed and fixed at a very quick pace." Rep. Hope Duke, R-Gravette, said she had "some issues with the process" of the bill's passage but ultimately decided to support the bill. "We've got to get this right, and I'm trusting that we're going to get this right," Duke said.

        SPRINGDALE -- A Springdale police officer shot a teen in the head Wednesday morning after he pointed a gun at him, according to a release from Capt. Jeff Taylor. The department received a call around 12:50 a.m. Wednesday saying a woman had been shot on Eicher Avenue in Springdale. When officers arrived, they found Argentina Agee, 31, shot in the arm, according to the news release. Officers were told the suspect was in a blue Chevrolet Tahoe, which they found nearby in the driveway at 1115 Eicher Ave., the release states. Eicher Avenue is about two blocks from Murphy Park. Officers found a 17-year-old lying under a blanket in the back seat. An officer opened the rear passenger door and told him to show his hands, according to the the release. The teen began to sit up, and as he did, he pointed a pistol at the officer who then fired, hitting the teen in the head, according to the news release. The teen's identity isn't being released at this time, the release states. Officers began providing first aid to the teen and Agee until paramedics arrived on the scene. Both he and Agee were taken to local hospitals for their injuries, according to the release. The investigation of use of deadly force by the officer as well as the shooting of the woman is being handled by the Washington County Sheriff's Office. The officer has been placed on paid administrative leave, which is standard protocol pending the Sheriff's Office investigation as well as an internal investigation, the release states. This is the second time in the last two weeks an officer has fired his weapon at a suspect near Murphy Park. Police received a call about 6 p.m. Feb. 15 from a woman saying Ethan Brasel, 20, wouldn't get out of her car in the western parking lot of Murphy Park on South Pleasant Street, according to a department news release. The caller reported Brasel had a pistol in his front waistband and there was another gun in the car, police said. Officers said they found Brasel sitting in the front passenger seat of a white car. Officers ordered Brasel out of the car and asked if he had any weapons, the release says. Brasel said he didn't have a weapon, but officers could see a rifle in the front passenger seat of the vehicle, the release says. Brasel ran when one of the officers began to pat him down in a search for weapons, police said. An officer yelled Brasel had a gun as police chased him west from the park, police said. An officer ordered Brasel to drop the gun, according to the release. An officer then fired his gun at Brasel but didn't hit him, the release said. The call about Tuesday's shooting came from a house at the intersection of Eicher and South Pleasant Street, a half-mile south of Murphy Park, which also is on Pleasant, the site of the Feb. 15 shooting. Taylor said the shootings aren't related. Kelly Cantrell, a spokesman for the Sheriff's Office, said the investigation of that incident is also continuing.

        FAYETTEVILLE -- A City Council committee wants to find a balance between a private property owner's desire to provide a safe place for unsheltered residents to live and preserving the well-being of neighbors. Members of the council's Ordinance Review Committee on Wednesday heard from Richard Tiffany, who owns property on South Lt. Col. Leroy Pond Avenue, immediately north of the Fayetteville National Cemetery. Tiffany has allowed people experiencing homelessness to live on the property for about a dozen years. The city recently received complaints about disturbances, trash, odors and other nuisances associated with the property. Tiffany said only a couple unsheltered residents stayed on the property most of the time, but within the last few years, the population has grown to 10 or 12. The city issued a code violation letter in October, saying a campground was operating within a property zoned for multifamily residential use. Campgrounds are considered a conditional citywide land use under city code, which requires a permit. However, there is no definition of campground in city code. The letter said Tiffany either needed to get a conditional use permit from the Planning Commission or cease using the property as a campground. Tiffany suggested changing the definition of a citywide conditional land use in city code to apply only to business use, where money is exchanged. Residents who stay on Tiffany's property live there for free. However, the current definition of a conditional citywide land use includes more than just campgrounds. It also includes airports, flying fields and heliports; recycling drop-off; solid waste and recreational vehicle sewage disposal; carnivals, circuses and tent revivals; and schools and churches. If the city were to adopt Tiffany's suggested change, it could enable residents to use their property for any of those uses as long as money is not exchanged, said Jonathan Curth, the city's development services director. For instance, someone could conceivably use their yard as a heliport, carnival or solid waste disposal without a permit as long as money wasn't exchanged. Police Capt. Brad Renfro said the department has responded to a number of calls at the property over the years. Since 2013, there have been 328 police calls for service and 149 fire calls, totaling 447. In 2021, there were 27 disturbance calls, nine last year and five so far this year, he said. A stabbing was reported last July. Other call types last year included 911 hangup, shots heard, theft, threat, welfare concern, noise, loud party and trespassing, Renfro said, in addition to officer-initiated calls. Tiffany said most of the people who stay at his property are women, some of whom have been there more than a year. Women experiencing homelessness have difficulty finding a safe place to live, he said. "They are there because it's the safest place they can find in town," Tiffany said. Tiffany said he checks in on the property two to six days per week. He said many of the complaints come from people visiting the nearby cemetery. City Council members on the committee are D'Andre Jones, Sarah Moore, Scott Berna and Holly Hertzberg. Berna said he was worried about the potential ramifications of changing city code like how Tiffany suggested. "I applaud you for what you're trying to do and the heart that you have for individuals in a bad situation," Berna told Tiffany. "But in this particular case, I'm struggling to change that definition and open that door to something I think is problematic." Jones said he has received numerous calls from neighbors with concerns about the property, and the council needs to strike a balance. "That's my priority -- making sure that we do have a safe place for the homeless community members, but also making sure that the well-being of our neighbors is not compromised," he said. The committee asked Curth to come up with some potential code changes and definitions for a campground. The group plans to discuss the matter again at 5 p.m. March 15.

        A student group at Little Rock Central High School has taken a public stand against Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders' invocation of Central High history in her speeches, and also to her education legislation known as the proposed Arkansas LEARNS Act. "Sarah Huckabee Sanders' LEARNS bill will usher in a new era of segregation in Arkansas, where middle and upper class white families take resources from public schools to escape to private ones, leaving marginalized kids with crumbling facilities, an antiquated curriculum, and teachers who are forced to prioritize their job security over the quality of their instruction," concludes the letter/petition. The online, open letter was written by students Bekah Jackson, Gryffyn May, Addison McCuien and Ernest Quirk with contributions from 12 others: Zaina Daaboul, Jo Dobry, Beecher De Rossitte, Maddy Douglas, Zora Key, Rhone Kuta, Ray Laster, Bird Mosley-Sims, Kishaun Pitts, Parker Ruppel, Max Wiggins, and Melissa Xiang. The full letter is available here: https://bit.ly/3kFJWH8 "Governor Sanders, as students of Little Rock Central High School, we refuse to accept your desecration of our past and corruption of our futures," says the letter, which had garnered 989 signatures as of Wednesday evening. Those signatures are from 778 self-identified as students, 204 parents and 48 employees -- all currently or previously associated with Central, said Malik Mitchell, volunteer community adviser to Central's Young Leftists organization. The organization is the sponsor of the open-letter/petition. Mitchell said Wednesday that the student group is working to decide how and when to present the letter to the governor. The letter and petition come at a time when the Arkansas LEARNS bill, Senate Bill 294, is rapidly moving through the Legislature. It was approved last week by the Arkansas Senate and voted out of the House Education Committee on Wednesday to go to the full House. The student-written letter also comes in advance of a student-organized peaceful walk-out that is planned at Central High on Friday in opposition to the governor, who is herself a Central High alumnae, and the proposed legislation. Email requests to the governor's staff for a response from the governor to the student letter were not answered Wednesday evening. LEARNS stands for Literacy, Empowerment, Accountability, Readiness, Networking and Safety. The omnibus bill to revamp early childhood education-through-12th grade calls for an expanded, phased-in state-funded private and home school voucher system, a $14,000 increase to a $50,000-base teacher salary, the elimination of the Teacher Fair Dismissal Act and retention -- with some exceptions -- of third-graders who are not achieving at grade level in reading. It also includes provisions against indoctrination of students with Critical Race Theory that the bill describes as conflicting with the principle of equal protection under the law or encourages students to discriminate against someone based on characteristics protected by federal or state law. The Central High students wrote that Sanders and the proposed LEARNS Act jeopardize the ideals of ambition, personality, opportunity and preparation that are represented by statues that are carved into the face of the landmark school. "By siphoning funds and resources away from public education and into the private sector, the ambition of our disadvantaged students and hardworking faculty will be stifled," the letter states. "Governor Sanders' intent to imitate policies similar to those of Florida's anti-LGBTQ+ legislation will suppress the free expression of personality." "School choice policies which will favor upper-class families would create unequal opportunities for lower-income students." "Reforms that attack school coursework deemed too inappropriate for students will dramatically decrease their preparation to face real-world social issues," the letter states. "Governor Sanders' approach is completely antithetical to the values that Central High stands for," the Central students wrote. "As much as she tries to desperately cling to the legacy of our historic institution, we, as students of Central High, unequivocally reject her exploitation of our school's achievements." The students note that Sanders in her speeches, including in her January rebuttal to the president's State of the Union message, referred to the 1997 40th anniversary of the desegregation of Central High with the ceremonial opening of Central's doors by then President Bill Clinton and then Gov. Mike Huckabee -- Sanders' father -- to the school's original nine Black students. The students argue that Sanders' definition and "crusade" against critical race theory have the potential to "erase" Central's history that includes angry white mobs and lawmaker opposition to desegregation in 1957 and the closing of high schools in Little Rock in 1958-59 to stop desegregation. "The teachings of CRT are not about demonizing individuals or discriminating based on race, but simply about accepting that the consequences of explicitly racist policies written by explicitly racist individuals are still present in our institutions," the students wrote. The letter's authors added: "If Governor Sanders had her way, we wouldn't be able to examine how racism shaped these structures to allow for these violations to take place." The letter raises questions about and criticizes other components of the Arkansas LEARNS bill. The letter writers focused on provisions to eliminate existing legal safeguards for school employees, changes in youth mental health programs and the retention of struggling third-grade readers. The letter writers argue that the reading initiative is a regressive measure that "ignores" data indicating the low socio-economic conditions are contributors to declining literacy rates. The letter's authors also focus on the governor's proposal to make universally available taxpayer funded voucher system that will enable parents to direct public funding equal to 90% of per student foundation aid in public schools to education expenses in private and home schools. The proposed voucher system would be phased in and opened to all families within three years. "This will disproportionately harm rural areas, which already have less access to resources yet make up the majority of Arkansas' school districts," the student letter wrote. "In addition, if a student doesn't meet a school's academic standards, they can lose their voucher and be sent back to their original school."

        WASHINGTON -- U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., grilled Attorney General Merrick Garland on Wednesday over the Biden administration's asylum policies and other Justice Department decisions, including actions affecting federal prosecutors. Garland appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee to explain the Justice Department's operations. The attorney general faced questions from lawmakers regarding multiple issues, including fentanyl and the related rise in overdose deaths. Cotton was among the Republicans who used the hearing to rebuke Garland, who has served as attorney general since March 2021. The Little Rock senator questioned Garland over the Justice Department's decision to end a Trump administration policy concerning people seeking asylum in the United States. Garland vacated the rule limiting asylum for individuals seeking protection from domestic and gang violence. "This was based on threats specifically to individuals, on gangs where the country was unable to protect the person," Garland told Cotton. "It wasn't about violence in general." Cotton argued the Justice Department is failing to address domestic violent crime, citing American cities with higher crime rates than countries whose citizens could be affected by the asylum policy. "Is the United States government and the city governments of St. Louis and Baltimore and New Orleans unwilling and unable to protect its own citizens?" Cotton asked.  "I don't believe they are unwilling," Garland responded. "They are doing everything that they can. We're supporting them in every way that they can. The examples [of nations] that you're talking about are examples where they are unwilling to protect from gangs." Cotton challenged Garland over a December 2022 memorandum regarding charges and sentencing. The directive -- which references the agency's established Principles of Federal Prosecution -- emphasizes the importance of seeking prosecution in cases with admissible evidence, but prosecutors must additionally consider if sentencing would have an outcome "proportional to the seriousness of the defendant's conduct" and provide sufficient punishment and public protection. "I have gotten numerous, numerous contacts in my office from your prosecutors who are shocked that you overturned this decades-long bipartisan standard," Cotton said. Garland said the memorandum does not direct prosecutors to not seek a case. "I'm well aware of the standard because I helped write the standard originally," the attorney general said before Cotton interjected. "Because it was a Carter administration standard," the senator said. "Not specifically known for being tough on crime." "Well, it was the first time the Principles of Prosecution were reduced to a book, which explained what they were. It was included in it," Garland said. "No one is being directed to not do anything." Cotton took exception to the memorandum's language on mandatory minimum sentences. The directive states related provisions have "often caused unwarranted disproportionality in sentencing and disproportionately severe sentences."  Garland said there are exceptions for drug trafficking and violent crimes, adding to Texas Sen. John Cornyn the directive is tied to resource allocation. "These include our investigators and how much we have to investigate to establish requirements for mandatory minimums, the prosecutors who have to prove those cases, the judges who have to try those cases, and the jails that have to hold those individuals for longer terms," Garland told Cotton. "The memorandum was crystal clear that they are to charge the most serious provable offense in cases involving violent crime and drug trafficking." The third subject of Cotton's questioning involved how the Justice Department handled protests outside of Supreme Court justices' homes. The demonstrations stemmed from a draft Supreme Court opinion leaked last May stating an end to the national right to abortion. Justices issued a similar opinion last June, triggering additional protests outside of these residences and a wave of marches. Garland said U.S. marshals at the protests opted not to arrest protesters. "Marshals are law enforcement officials, not prosecutors," Cotton said. "These people were not criminal masterminds," the senator said. "They posted videos of themselves on their social media accounts. They advertised the protests in advance. It is possible to arrest someone for an offense after an offense has occurred, is it not?" Garland said the Justice Department allocates its resources toward protecting justices and their families. "Mr. Attorney General, do you not think that it would perhaps provide a deterrent effect if you arrested some of these criminal protesters and charged them and threw them in federal prison?" Cotton asked. "We are trying to protect the lives of the justices. That is our principal priority," Garland said. "I'm leaving it to the Marshal Service to make determinations on the ground. They have to make determinations about what they see on the ground." Cotton quizzed Garland about not directing department efforts toward investigating the protesters. The senator compared the inaction to the Justice Department's efforts related to the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol; agents continue to investigate the riot, in which supporters of former President Donald Trump stopped the certification of the 2020 presidential election. "I think the answer is that you are sympathetic to the protesters. That you didn't like the decision that the justices were about to issue," the senator said. "I think we all know what you would do if a bunch of conservative protesters were outside the home of a Democratic-appointed justice to the Supreme Court." "No one has been arrested under that statute under those circumstances," Garland replied. Garland's appearance happened amid special counsel investigations regarding classified documents found at the residences and offices of Trump and President Joe Biden. Garland defended the decision to appoint special counsels in both cases, noting the campaign ambitions of both men.

         The chairman of the Arkansas State Medical Board has been suspended from participation in the state Medicaid program in response to a "credible allegation of fraud," according to a letter from the state's Office of Medicaid Inspector General. All payments for Medicaid services to Dr. Brian Hyatt, a Rogers psychiatrist, have been suspended by the office, according to the Friday letter acquired by the Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette under the state Freedom of Information Act. The office determined there was a "credible allegation of fraud" against Hyatt, according to the letter. According to an affidavit for a warrant to search Hyatt's phone records, the state attorney general's office was contacted in April 2022 by a whistleblower from the behavioral health unit of Northwest Medical Center in Springdale. Hyatt had been the medical director of the unit since January 2018. His contract with the hospital was "abruptly terminated" in May of last year, the affidavit states. Investigators with the attorney general's office watched hundreds of hours of surveillance video from the behavioral unit and did not see Hyatt enter a patient's room or make direct contact with a patient, the affidavit states. According to the affidavit, "red flags" were identified during an analysis of Hyatt's Medicaid claims and use of evaluation and management coding, which is used to bill for medical services. "Subsequent hospital care" codes like 99231, 99232 and 99233 are the most commonly billed codes, each paying a progressively higher rate, according to the affidavit. More complicated cases with patients who are unstable or are developing a new problem are indicated by a 99233 code, the affidavit states. Between January 2019 and June 30, 2022, Hyatt billed more Medicaid patients at the 99233 code than any other doctor billed for all of their Medicaid patients, the affidavit states. During that time period, "99.5% of the continuing hospital care claims for Medicaid recipients/patients were billed to Medicaid under 99233," the affidavit states. "According to the claims submitted by Dr. Hyatt and the non-physician providers working under his supervision, no patient being treated in the behavioral health unit located at Northwest Medical Center ever got better, at least not before the day of the patient's release." Data shows about 20% of all "subsequent hospital care" codes billed nationally – and about 39% billed by Arkansas psychiatrists – are the 99233 code, according to the affidavit. "Dr. Hyatt is a clear outlier, and his claims are so high they skew the averages on certain codes for the entire Medicaid program in Arkansas," the affidavit states. Billing patients at a higher rate than is appropriate is a kind of Medicaid fraud, the affidavit states. In Arkansas, Medicaid fraud resulting in an overpayment over $2,500 is a felony. A Pulaski County circuit judge granted the request for the search warrant on Jan. 17. Hyatt has not been charged with a crime. He has 30 days to appeal his suspension from the Medicaid program. The attorney general's office is also investigating "possible Medicare fraud" as well as "other overpayments and irregularities," according to the affidavit. Christina Bull, spokeswoman for Northwest Medical Center, said the hospital "continues to cooperate with the Attorney General's Office during their investigation concerning Dr. Hyatt." "We take very seriously our responsibility to provide a safe environment of care for our patients and for our team members," she said. Hyatt owns and operates Pinnacle Premier Psychiatry in Rogers. He was appointed to the Medical Board in January 2019 by then-Gov. Asa Hutchinson and later elected chairman. His current term on the board expires Dec. 31, 2024. The Medical Board is holding a special meeting at noon today in Little Rock. A discussion of the board's leadership is the only item that appears on the meeting agenda.

        The Arkansas Senate on Wednesday handily approved a bill that would require the secretary of state to permit and arrange the placement on the state Capitol grounds of a suitable monument commemorating "unborn children aborted" after the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion across the nation. The Senate voted 25-7 to send Senate Bill 307 by Sen. Kim Hammer, R-Benton, to the House for further consideration. On June 24, then-Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge signed a certificate implementing a 2019 law that bans abortions in Arkansas except to save the life of the mother in a medical emergency, just hours after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the landmark 1973 ruling that legalized abortion across the nation. Hammer told the Senate the monument would recognize the 236,000 babies who were not born in Arkansas because of abortions in the period from 1973 until 2022 as a result of the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Roe v. Wade. The monument would be privately financed under the bill, he said. But Sen. Clarke Tucker, D-Little Rock, who voted against the bill, said abortion has been a contentious issue in Arkansas and in the United States. [DOCUMENT: Read the bill to create 'a monument to the unborn' » arkansasonline.com/32sb307/] This bill would inject a contentious political issue onto the state Capitol grounds, and he said he expects the proposed monument would be very painful for many women. Hammer said his aim is for the proposed monument to be tastefully done, adding there also are women who have regretted their abortions. He said he hopes people who would see the monument would remember a chapter in the state's history in which "so many babies were aborted. "It will give us an opportunity to hopefully fight to make sure that that history is never repeated," Hammer said. Under Senate Bill 307, the Capitol Arts and Grounds Commission would oversee the selection of the artist and design of the monument "with input from pro-life groups in Arkansas." The secretary of state would have final approval of the selection of the artist and design of the monument selected by the commission before any construction is started under SB307. Upon approval of the artist and design, the secretary of state would be required to arrange for the construction, placement and dedication of the monument on the state Capitol grounds by private entities at no expense to the state. The bill would establish on the books of the state treasurer, the state auditor and the state's chief fiscal officer a trust fund to consist of gifts, grants and donations from individuals and organizations, and other funds as may be provided by law. The trust fund would be used exclusively for erecting and maintaining a suitable monument on the state Capitol grounds commemorating "unborn children aborted" during the Roe v. Wade era. Afterward, Secretary of State John Thurston's spokeswoman Jaime Land said the Republican secretary of state supports SB307 and "the work to commemorate the sanctity of life and honor the children who have been lost."

        The Arkansas Senate on Wednesday sent a bill intended to create criminal penalties for a person who knowingly remains in a bathroom of the opposite sex while a minor is present to the Senate Judiciary Committee to be amended, two days after it cleared the committee. The Senate voted to refer Senate Bill 270 by Sen. John Payton, R-Wilburn, back to the Senate committee at the request of Payton, after Sen. Jimmy Hickey, R-Texarkana, asked him to send it back to the committee. "We need to get this right in committee," Hickey told the Senate. Payton said there is a drafting error in his bill and he would ask the Senate Judiciary Committee to amend the bill to fix the error. He said Sen. Clarke Tucker, D-Little Rock, and Hickey "are right" and "it needs to be fixed." He said several legislative employees and the attorney general's office and the Family Council vetted the bill before it was filed. SB270 would generally criminalize instances where a person 18 or older knowingly "enters into and remains in a public changing facility that is assigned to persons of the opposite sex while knowing a minor of the opposite sex is present in the public changing facility." Among other exceptions, the bill would provide exemptions for parents accompanying minors, people rendering medical assistance, law enforcement officials accompanying a person in their custody and people authorized to maintain and inspect facilities. Under the bill, a person would be guilty of a misdemeanor the first two times they violated the section. Subsequent offenses would be classified as felonies. Payton told the Senate he considers his bill to be a compromise, but he knows both sides may be so far apart that even an effort to compromise could be considered to be extreme. "The bottom line is this bill does not make it illegal for somebody to use the wrong bathroom if it does not match up with their sex unless there is a child present," he said. The bill would protect his granddaughters and grandsons, Payton said. "I think that it's a reasonable compromise to ask somebody that if you are going to use the wrong bathroom or dressing room that you make sure there is not a minor in there, and that's all this bill does," he said. Payton said many constituents have told him that "we need to stop people from going into the wrong restroom [and] the wrong dressing room, and there are concerns over situations that people are hearing about." He said the bill would cover both transgender and heterosexual people. But Tucker said the bill "makes it a crime to be a transgender adult in Arkansas." If enacted, the bill would be the most extreme anti-transgender law in America, he said. Tucker, an attorney, said there are numerous problems with the bill and a prosecutor will have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt what a person's genitals were when they were born in order to obtain a conviction of the bill. "What is a bill that's in this kind of shape doing on the floor of the Arkansas state Senate? Even worse, why does it stand such a high chance of passing?" he asked. Tucker said he received a knife from Hickey during a dinner in conjunction with the Senate's organizational session in 2020, and Hickey's message was that "iron sharpens iron." "I don't know about you, Senator Hickey, but I am worried that some folks have left their iron at home because we need to see some more sharpening around here," he said. "Vetting bills is not partisan," Tucker said. "It requires good faith, mutual respect and hard work, and that's it." He said Payton has indicated he would fix the bill through an amendment in the House. Along with Payton's bill, lawmakers have considered at least one other measure which critics say could affect bathroom access for transgender people. House Bill 1156, by Rep. Mary Bentley, R-Perryville, would require public schools and open enrollment public charter schools to restrict people from using a restroom that does not correspond with the sex listed on their birth certificate. Bentley's bill was pulled from the Senate floor earlier this month to allow for amendment. It has since been referred to the Senate Committee on Education. Lawmakers also have advanced a bill that would allow a person who was injured by a "gender transition procedure" as a minor to sue the health professional who performed the procedure. The Senate voted last week along party lines to send Senate Bill 199, by Sen. Gary Stubblefield, R-Branch, to the House. The bill is included in a special order of business on the House Committee on Judiciary's agenda on March 7.

         The owner of a Flippin coffee shop should be incarcerated for a month for entering the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and arguing with police officers who were trying to quell a riot, a prosecutor wrote in a sentencing memorandum filed Wednesday in federal court in the District of Columbia. Jon Thomas Mott, 40, of Yellville, spent 17 minutes in the Capitol before police pushed him out of the building, Assistant U.S. Attorney Graciela Rodriguez Lindberg wrote in the court filing. Once in the Capitol, Mott "argued aggressively with police officers," wrote Lindberg. When an officer used a baton to "limit Mott's advance, Mott grabbed the baton with his right hand and pushed it away." Mott then yelled at the officer, "don't touch me" and "if you don't touch me, I won't touch you," according to the memorandum. Mott argued with other officers before leaving the building. "Even if Mott did not place his hands on these officers, he diverted their attention from their primary task of clearing the rioters out of the Capitol building," wrote Lindberg. "And, after this initial officer confrontation, Mott continued to defy officers' commands to exit the building and argued with several officers throughout his 17 minutes inside the building. Those actions prolonged the rioters' occupation of the Capitol building, even if briefly. And Mott did lay hands on the baton of one officer, albeit in a defensive posture and not in an attempt to wrest the baton from the officer." As part of a plea agreement in November, Mott pleaded guilty to parading, demonstrating or picketing in a Capitol building. The misdemeanor charge carries a maximum penalty of six months imprisonment and a $5,000 fine. Prosecutors will request that the three other charges against Mott be dismissed at the time of sentencing, according to the plea agreement. Mott is scheduled to be sentenced on March 8, but his attorney has requested a continuance. Initially scheduled for an in-person sentencing hearing in Washington, U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth approved Mott's request to have the hearing by video teleconference instead. Besides a month in jail, the government is asking Lamberth to sentence Mott to three years probation and 60 hours of community service. According to his plea agreement, Mott has agreed to pay $500 in restitution. "Additionally aggravating is Mott's lack of sincere remorse or contrition for his illegal conduct," Lindberg wrote in Wednesday's filing. Mott "maintains a GiveSendGo campaign in which he claims that he and other January 6 rioters have been mistreated by law enforcement officials," wrote Lindberg. As of Wednesday afternoon, the fundraising campaign had raised $14,060 of its $30,000 goal, according to GiveSendGo.com. "I went to DC to protest our rights as free Americans, to make our voices count," according to a message on the website from the Mott family. "I went not to do violence or harm to anyone just express my constitutional right. I did end up inside the capital rotunda area and no further, but it was after the initial breach somewhat 45 min to an hour and walked in past police that did not stop me. I have it on video." During an interview with FBI agents after his arrest, Mott said he believed the Capitol was breached by "bad people" like Antifa, and then he and other "good people" entered because it was open, Lindberg wrote in the memorandum. "Mott claims he thought people could go into the Capitol; otherwise police officers near the entry could have grabbed him and said, 'you are not coming in here,'" according to Wednesday's court filing. "Mott also claimed he helped people because they (officers) were 'gassing the crap out of us' and he got the 'brunt end of the deal' with the pepper spray and gas. Mott stated that January 6 was a 'big day,' and a 'day in history' and 'I ain't going to apologize to nobody because it's my right.'" Mott's criminal history includes a misdemeanor conviction in Oklahoma for unlawfully carrying a weapon, according to the memorandum. At Mott's home, FBI agents found two firearm silencers "without required markings or identification" or serial numbers, wrote Lindberg. Mott has an associate degree and is certified to work on trucks and heavy equipment, according to the court filing. Since 2020, he has owned and operated The Bean Barn, a drive-through coffee shop in Flippin. The three charges being dismissed as part of Mott's plea agreement are 18 U.S.C. § 1752(a)(1), entering and remaining in a restricted building; 18 U.S.C. § 1752(a)(2), disorderly and disruptive conduct in a restricted building; and 40 U.S.C. § 5104(e)(2)(D), violent entry and disorderly conduct in a Capitol building. Mott has remained free since his initial arrest on May 13, 2021. The Jan. 6 riot escalated from a "Stop the Steal" rally when some supporters of then-President Donald Trump entered the U.S. Capitol and attempted to stop Congress from certifying the Electoral College vote for Joe Biden's presidential victory. Besides Mott, four other Arkansans have been charged in connection with the Capitol riot. Robert Thomas Snow of Heber Springs, 79, pleaded guilty to the same charge as Mott in connection with the Jan. 6 breach. Snow also reached a plea agreement with prosecutors. U.S. District Judge Timothy J. Kelly sentenced Snow to one year of probation and 60 hours of community service, which he apparently served with the Cleburne County Road Department. Kelly didn't sentence Snow to confinement. Brennen Cline Machacek, 32, of Hindsville, faces the same charges as Snow and Mott. Machacek has a status hearing scheduled for March 14. Two Arkansans were charged with felony crimes in the Jan. 6 riot. On Jan. 23, after a two-week trial, a jury in the District of Columbia federal court found Richard "Bigo" Barnett, 62, of Gravette, guilty on all eight charges against him. He is scheduled to be sentenced on May 3. He faces a maximum penalty of 47 years in prison. Barnett became well known after he posed for pictures with his foot on a desk in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office suite. Peter Francis Stager, 43, of Conway, pleaded guilty on Feb. 16 to Assaulting, Resisting, or Impeding Certain Officers Using a Dangerous Weapon and Aiding and Abetting, under U.S. Code 18:111(a)(1) and (b), and 2. Stager used a flag pole to beat a police officer who was face down on the Capitol steps, according to court filings and testimony. Stager is scheduled to be sentenced on July 24. He faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. Stager remains in the District of Columbia jail. He is the only Jan. 6 defendant from Arkansas who has been incarcerated while he case was pending.

         WASHINGTON -- A U.S. Senate committee continued its work on the coming farm bill Wednesday by reviewing the impact of conservation and forestry programs under the current law. The Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee began its evaluation of the current farm bill in the last Congress with lawmakers eyeing a fall deadline to pass new legislation. Legislators previously approved a farm bill in December 2018. The current law will expire Sept. 30 unless lawmakers pass an extension if they are unable to finalize new legislative text. The committee's hearing Wednesday focused on the farm bill's support for conservation and forestry programs. The Congressional Research Service estimates the next farm bill will include at least $57.5 billion for conservation and forestry programs. "Both of these issues are so important in the Natural State," Sen. John Boozman, R-Ark., the committee's top Republican, said in his opening remarks. "Productive farms and forests benefit wildlife, the environment, the quality of life and the economy of rural Arkansas." Boozman, of Rogers, noted conservation programs under the current farm bill have been successful because the efforts are "voluntary, incentive-based and locally led." He said if federal officials guided program priorities it could threaten the success of conservation efforts. "Conservation needs and the needs of our producers are as diverse as the crops they grow and the land that they grow them on. Our programs must reflect this reality and provide the flexibility our farmers and ranchers need," he said. "The prioritization of resource concerns must be left to the local level where producers decide how they can best address their unique and varied landscapes and needs." Terry Cosby, chief of the federal National Resources Conservation Service, stated in his written testimony the 2018 farm bill "made it clear that voluntary conservation programs are critical to the continued viability of production agriculture" while providing financial and technical assistance opportunities for producers and community leaders. Conservation funding increased in the last Congress; lawmakers approved more than $17 billion in outlays for conservation programs as part of last August's sweeping Inflation Reduction Act. Cosby told lawmakers his agency is additionally utilizing funding from the 2021 infrastructure law for rehabilitating dams and maintaining watersheds. Boozman raised concerns about the Inflation Reduction Act's efforts related to climate change and carbon sequestration related to conservation. The law allocated funding for programs addressing natural resource use and environmental concerns like carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions. "As a result, this limits the ability for many producers in Arkansas to implement conservation practices on their land related to nutrition and water management because that legislation only focuses on climate," he added. Cosby said producers have opportunities to apply for "everything we have in our portfolio." "When you look at all of the dollars that the 2018 farm bill provided and also what the IRA provided, we are looking at how do we implement practices on the land and how does that work," he said. "It works very well. "Those producers out there will have an opportunity to come in and continue to apply for those practices, and the same practices we're talking about that we've been applying for a lot of years also provide those benefits for climate." Angela Coleman, associate chief of the U.S. Forest Service, discussed her agency, emphasizing its approach to wildfire management. She stated the previous farm bill removed barriers, allowing shared stewardship and management between local stakeholders, landowners and government agencies. "Each new farm bill has equipped us with essential tools that enable us to tackle the natural resource challenges that we face, strengthen our work with all communities and partners, and equitably serve all Americans," she said. Coleman's three decades of experience includes work in the Southeast; she noted time spent in the Ouachita National Forest in Arkansas and Oklahoma. "I've learned forest management and land stewardship from the ground up, and I've witnessed tremendous change over the years," she said. "This includes the helpful changes we have seen in the farm bill with the forestry title." Wood innovation grants, according to Coleman, are part of the wildfire management strategy. She cited the development of cross-laminated timber at the University of Arkansas and Walmart Inc.'s corporate campus as essential actions in developing materials as well as growing Arkansas' lumber industry. Cross-laminated timber products consist of multiple layers of wood and provide additional fire resistance and durability against natural disasters. "Having a healthy timber-producing infrastructure is essential for the agency to be able to accomplish the very ambitious goals that we have set out to improve the resiliency in our forests [and] to protect communities from wildfire threats," Coleman said. "Our investments in wood innovation are a hallmark of how we need to look at our future. Obviously, Arkansas is out in front when it comes to utilizing mass timber, but the agency through our work in those same private programs has doubled our investments there, and the projects are going up quite a bit." The committee's previous hearings reviewing the farm bill have focused on the current law's other provisions, including agriculture research, trade and nutrition programs.

         The Faulkner County Library will temporarily suspend availability of its four meeting rooms to the public following complaints after a pair of events in January. Complaints from different members of the community started after one group hosted a "pastor story time" in one meeting room while another group hosted an "inclusive story time" just down the hall on Jan. 14. Library Director John McGraw said the two events left patrons and community members confused. "One of the problems is that there was a lot of confusion on whether or not these were library programs," McGraw said. "People were calling and saying we shouldn't have the pastor story hour because that's not what libraries are for and we shouldn't have the diversity story hour because that's not what libraries are for. I kept saying over and over again, these are not library programs. We don't do anything but give the public the space to have a public meeting." McGraw said the ability to reserve one of the four rooms has been removed for the time being. The space will be used for library programming until the library board meets in March to discuss the policy further. "For now, we've cancelled all the programs for the public, got ourselves out of the public meeting business and are trying to shift towards more programming for children, more programming for adults," McGraw said. Whether the library will open the rooms for public meetings is to be discussed in the board's March meeting. Faulkner County Judge Allen Dodson said Wednesday that he advised the library's board to adjust its public meeting room policy. "If you think you can better control [the public meetings], control it," he said he advised the board. "If you can't, figure out what that looks like for the library." He said the library should consider requiring more information on what speakers might be using the room for, but that he trusts the board as "experts" of the library to study the issue and determine a solution. "Removing reservations permanently will cut Conway off from resources we've depended on," said organizers with the Coalition for Social Justice, which sponsored the inclusive story time. "Black and Brown queer communities will always be disproportionately affected by exclusion, and they're also the ones who have rallied behind the library in the past." According to a press release from the group, they decided to host an inclusive story time event in one of the meeting rooms after a pastor hosted a story hour where "he read books villainizing and othering queer people." "We made no attempts to halt the pastor story hour, as the meeting rooms in the library are public spaces available to be used by all," the press release said. The statement also said a Quorum Court member attempted to enter the inclusive story hour to take a photograph of the kids inside in what they believe was an attempt to "win political points." The public rooms -- two of them small and two large -- had been reserved by pastors, local organizers and other various groups on a first come, first served basis. Meetings held in the rooms must follow the laws of open meetings and allow entrance to anybody who attends. As for children and the content available -- Dodson said the library should not consider removing any content, but discuss ways to control how accessible certain content is to certain age groups. He suggested the library consider placing more inappropriate material higher up, away from kids or talk about ways to better navigate protecting children in the library. "I want to discuss this with the other board members and discuss it with John and see what their thoughts are," said library board member Stephanie Vanderslice. "I think it's unfortunate that this has come up. I think the more the library can be used for everyone, the better. But clearly, that's not what's happening right now. I'm hopeful that we'll be able to work out a policy that is fair to everyone." McGraw said the board will discuss the possibility of eliminating the four rooms for public use entirely, using the space for library programming. "We outgrew this building about 30 years ago," said McGraw. "We do a massive amount of Conway programming and we are at the limit of what we can do around having four meeting rooms to the public. We checked out those rooms roughly 1,200 times in the last year." McGraw said the January meeting were not the first issue the library has run into regarding the meeting rooms. "In 2017, we had a Neo-Confederate group, the League of the South, wanting to have their annual convention here," he said. "They didn't recognize that these are open meetings and they didn't take too kindly to Black people showing up. If you have a meeting in these rooms, you're agreeing to them being an open meeting." He added that the library continues to face spacing issues, often leaving patrons with no place to park when attending story times and no room for library programs when hosting public meetings.

        If the Arkansas Supreme Court grants the state's motion to dismiss an appeal for new DNA testing in the West Memphis Three case, the request will be filed again in a different county, attorneys for Damien Echols wrote in an Arkansas Supreme Court filing on Wednesday. "Granting of the State's motion effects nothing but delay into the processing of Echols' petition," according to his attorneys. Citing a boxing maneuver meant to tire out opponents, they wrote, "The Court should decline to endorse this 'rope-a-dope' strategy by the State." The issue involves jurisdiction. Echols, along with Jason Baldwin and Jessie Misskelley, were convicted in 1994 of the slayings of three 8-year-old boys -- Christopher Byers, Steve Branch and Michael Moore -- whose bodies were found in a drainage ditch near West Memphis the previous year. Echols was sentenced to death. The homicides occurred in Crittenden County, but Echols received a change of venue to Craighead County, where he was tried and convicted. No DNA evidence ever linked the three to the deaths, and they were released from prison in 2011 after prosecutors allowed them to walk free as part of a deal known as an Alford Plea, which was also entered in Craighead County Circuit Court. An Alford plea is a guilty plea in criminal court. By taking an Alford plea, a defendant does not admit to the criminal act and asserts their innocence, but agrees that the evidence presented by the prosecution would be likely to persuade a judge or jury to find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Since then, the defendants have been trying to clear their names. Attorneys representing Echols petitioned Crittenden County Circuit Court on Jan. 24, 2022, to permit new M-Vac wet-vacuum DNA testing on sneaker laces that were used to hogtie the three boys. This type of DNA testing wasn't available when previous DNA tests were done on evidence from the crime scene, according to the court filing. Crittenden County Circuit Judge Tonya Alexander denied Echols' request in June, stating that he wasn't entitled to the evidence examination, even if it could clear him, because the law only allows incarcerated convicts the opportunity to seek new evidence testing. Echols appealed the decision to the Arkansas Supreme Court. On Feb. 21, Assistant Attorney General Brooke Jackson Gasaway filed a motion saying Echols' appeal should be dismissed because he filed his initial request in the wrong county. "Echols is appealing the Crittenden County Circuit Court's denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus under Act 1780 of 2001," wrote Gasaway. "His conviction, however, was entered in the Craighead County Circuit Court in case number CR-93-540A. "Under Ark. Code Ann. § 16-112-201(a) (Repl. 2016), an Act 1780 habeas petition must be filed in the circuit court where the judgment of 'conviction was entered.' Because Echols filed his petition in the wrong county, this court should dismiss for lack of jurisdiction." But that's irrelevant because both Crittenden and Craighead counties are in Arkansas' 2nd Judicial Circuit, according to Wednesday's filing from Echols' attorneys -- John R. Elrod of Fayetteville, Patrick J. Benca of Little Rock and Stephen L. Braga of Washington, D.C. They cite a 2020 case, Williams v. State, in which the Arkansas Supreme Court confronted a situation where a defendant "alleged that a jurisdictional violation occurred because he entered his plea in Desha County and not in Chicot County, where the crime was committed and the judgment was entered." Desha and Chicot counties are both in Arkansas' 10th Judicial Circuit. The Supreme Court found that this "present[ed] issues of local jurisdiction," rather than "subject matter jurisdiction," according to Echols' filing. Circuit judges have "the authority to preside over proceedings in any courtroom, in any county, within the judicial district for which that judge was elected." The parties can't waive a court's lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, according to Echols' attorneys. They note that Prosecuting Attorney Keith L. Chrestman agreed to waive venue for the purpose of the circuit court hearing before Judge Alexander in Crittenden County in June. "[V]enue and jurisdiction, though sometimes used interchangeably, are two distinct legal concepts," Echols' attorneys wrote, citing a 1994 case, Davis v. Reed. "Venue is the geographic area, like a county, where an action is brought to trial. Jurisdiction is the power of a court to decide cases and presupposes the control over the subject matter and parties."

        The Arkansas House on Wednesday advanced bills intended to curb distracted driving and to address mounting thefts of catalytic converters. House Bill 1486 would create a criminal penalty for drivers who cause serious physical injury or death while using "wireless telecommunications" devices. The measure passed on a vote of 80-5 and moves to the Senate for further consideration. Rep. Ashley Hudson, D-Little Rock, said she sponsored the bill in honor of Ashton Rae Woods, a woman who was killed in an accident with a distracted driver. Woods, 33, was involved in a two-car accident Oct. 7 on Arkansas Highway 263 in rural Stone County, according to a report from Arkansas State Police. Hudson said Woods had served as a full-time missionary until the coronavirus pandemic and left behind two sisters, a father and "loads and loads of family members who care very deeply about her." The bill originated after Woods' father contacted Hudson and asked her if there were any laws penalizing distracted drivers who cause serious harm or death. While current statutes include fines for people who are pulled over for texting and other distractions, Hudson said there are no enhancements for distracted drivers responsible for accidents resulting in serious injury or death. "Her dad decided to take Ashton's legacy of living a life of service and to try to make her death a service to her community as well," Hudson said. The bill would establish a Class A misdemeanor for drivers who cause collisions or accidents that result "in serious physical injury or death of another person" while "using a wireless telecommunications device." A violation of the law would be punishable by imprisonment for no more than a year, up to 100 hours of community service and a fine not to exceed $2,500. Hudson said the misdemeanor could serve as a stand-alone charge or be added to cases where a driver faces other charges related to an accident. State and county law enforcement officials have said they are capable of investigating accidents to determine if distracted driving was a cause, Hudson said. Rep. Justin Gonzales, R-Okolona, asked if the bill would apply to drivers using hands-free devices or their cell phones to play music. Hudson said her bill would apply a definition of distracted driving already used in state law for ticketing drivers. "I would say that generally speaking if you're messing with your phone for your Bluetooth or your music, that probably would qualify if you're looking down at your phone instead of looking at the road," she said. If enacted, the bill would create Ashton's Law. [DOCUMENT: Read the bill targeting catalytic converter thefts » arkansasonline.com/32hb1365/] CATALYTIC CONVERTERS House Bill 1365, which aims to make the "unauthorized possession of a catalytic converter" a felony and increase penalties for the theft of a catalytic converter, passed the House with a vote of 97-0. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Mike Holcomb, R-Pine Bluff, moves to the Senate for further consideration. Holcomb presented his bill as a measure needed to address the widespread theft of catalytic converters from vehicles. "Probably everyone here has had a neighbor or yourself or your church had a catalytic converter stolen," he said. Holcomb said lawmakers have filed more than a 100 bills in nearby states related to the theft of catalytic converters. Between 2019 and 2022, catalytic converter thefts nationwide increased by 1,215%. Converters contain precious metals including rhodium, palladium and platinum, which have skyrocketed in value, according to the National Insurance Crime Bureau. Holcomb said he met with stakeholders, including representatives of scrap metal recyclers, county officials and law enforcement officers, to create the bill. Under current law, Holcomb said law enforcement officials can't take any action against a person for possessing multiple catalytic converters. If the bill were to pass, a person could be charged with a crime if they knowingly "possess a catalytic converter that has been removed from a motor vehicle and that is not permanently marked." The measure would not apply if the person is the owner of the vehicle from which the converter was removed or possess the converter in the "ordinary course" of their business. A converter would have to be marked with the date it was removed from the vehicle and the identification number of the vehicle. The bill lists several businesses including scrap metal recyclers, towing companies and used automotive parts recyclers that may normally possess catalytic converters. Theft of a catalytic converter would be a Class C felony under the bill. "Unauthorized possession of a catalytic converter" would be a Class C felony if the person has been convicted of the offense before or if the person also "commits or attempts, conspires, or solicits another person to commit an offense related to a catalytic converter." Otherwise, the offense would be a Class D felony, under the bill. The bill also would require scrap metal recyclers to register with county sheriffs and maintain records of used catalytic converter purchases like other buyers of used catalytic converters.

         Jobless benefits, tax bill advances A bill aimed at reducing the amount of time a person may receive unemployment insurance from four months to three cleared an Arkansas Senate committee Wednesday. The Senate Public Health, Welfare and Labor Committee sent House Bill 1430 by Rep. Robin Lundstrum, R- Elm Springs, to the full Senate. The legislation would drop the state's new employer tax from 2.9% to 1.9%. It also would cut the unemployment tax stabilization rate from 0.20% to 0.125% in fiscal 2024. In fiscal year 2025, the stabilization rate would drop to 0.1%. The bill also would reduce the assessed penalty rate on employers who fail to make unemployment-related payments on time from 14% to 10%. Arkansas unemployment insurance tax rates range from 0.1% to 5%, plus the stabilization rate in effect for the current year. The tax is computed on the wages paid to each employee on a calendar quarter basis, according to the Division of Workforce Services website. The measure would represent a tax cut of $31 million, and the state's unemployment insurance trust fund has a balance of more than $900 million, Lundstrum said. -- Michael R. Wickline and Will Langhorne Bill repeals work permit for minors The Senate Public Health, Welfare and Labor Committee on Wednesday advanced a bill that would repeal a state work permit requirement for children younger than 16 seeking employment. In a 5-2 vote, the committee endorsed House Bill 1410 by Rep. Rebecca Burkes, R-Lowell. The bill would ax the state law that bars a person, firm or corporation from employing or permitting any children younger than 16 to work in or in connection with any establishment or occupation until the person, firm or corporation employing the child procures and keeps on file an employment certificate, accessible to the state Division of Labor, and the Division of Elementary and Secondary Education or local school officials. HB1410 also would eliminate the state law that requires the employment certificate to be issued by the Division of Labor director, and the application for the employment certificate to include a proof of age, a description of the work and work schedule, and written consent from the parent or guardian. Burkes told the committee the state work permit is required for 14- and 15-year-olds before they can a get a job, and children younger than 14 in Arkansas generally cannot work unless they are working for family businesses or similar reasons. "This bill came to me from the Foundation for Government Accountability," he said. "It truly is just paperwork that is a barrier for a 14- or 15-year-old to get a job." Committee Chairwoman Sen. Missy Irvin, R-Mountain View, who voted against the bill, said afterward that "The perception this creates isn't worth the elimination of a simple process. "It's a simple step in creating a legal protection for kids and for their parents from potentially abusive or unsafe situations." -- Michael R.Wickline Senate panel OKs Vincent Parks Act The Senate Public, Health Welfare and Labor Committee on Wednesday endorsed a bill that would require state physical fitness instructors to complete training on how to recognize and respond to certain health conditions. The committee advanced to the Senate House Bill 1458 by Rep. Frances Cavenaugh, R-Walnut Ridge, which would create the Vincent Parks Act if enacted. The bill is intended to honor Parks, a Jonesboro police officer who died after training in extreme heat in July at the state police academy. The bill would require physical fitness instructors responsible for training law enforcement officers, firefighters and Arkansas Game and Fish Commission officers to receive certification on recognizing and managing dehydration and concussions. Instructors also would have to complete training on environmental issues that could threaten the health or safety of a person by causing heat exhaustion or sudden cardiac arrest. It also would require physical fitness instructors to remove any cadet or officer who faints, loses consciousness or exhibits warning signs of cardiac arrest from training. A cadet or officer would be barred from returning to training until cleared in writing by a licensed physician. An instructor acting in good faith would not be liable for any act or omission under the bill unless the fault is intentional, reckless or grossly negligent. -- Michael R. Wickline Senate OKs bill on ballot title review The Arkansas Senate on Wednesday approved a bill that would transfer the authority for considering and certifying the popular name and ballot title of proposed ballot measures from the state Board of Election Commissioners to the attorney general. The Senate voted 35-0 to send House Bill 1320 by Rep. David Ray, R-Maumelle, to the governor. Act 376 of 2019 shifted the responsibility of certifying a proposed ballot measure's popular name and ballot title from the attorney general to the state Board of Election Commissioners. Then-Attorney General Leslie Rutledge, who is now the state's lieutenant governor, supported the 2019 measure. Certification of the ballot title and popular name is one of the two requirements under state law for a proposal to get on the general election ballot. The other requirement is for the secretary of state to certify that the sponsor has submitted the required number of valid signatures of registered voters on petitions. In September, the Arkansas Supreme Court overturned a decision by the state Board of Election Commissioners not to certify the ballot title and popular name of a proposed constitutional amendment that would legalize recreational marijuana and cleared the way for votes to be counted on the proposed constitutional amendment. -- Michael R. Wickline Bill governs loan to Henderson State A legislative panel on Wednesday voted to endorse a proposal that would require Henderson State University make loan repayments of $958,333.33 a year in six installments, starting Dec. 1, 2024, and ending on Dec. 1, 2029, to the state. Henderson State University received a $6 million loan from the state's Budget Stabilization Fund in fiscal 2020 and currently owes that fund about $5.75 million, said Sen. Jim Hickey, R-Texarkana, who proposed an amendment to House Bill 1270 that the Joint Budget Committee's Special Language Subcommittee approved. Under Hickey's amendment, the annual loan repayments from Henderson State University may be modified by the Legislative Council, or if the General Assembly is in session, the Joint Budget Committee based upon its review of the status of the loan received from the Budget Stabilization Trust Fund. The modification of the loan repayments may include the amount of one or more loan payments and the timing of one or more loan repayments.. The bill is Henderson State University's appropriation for fiscal 2024, which starts July 1, 2023, and ends June 30, 2024. -- Michael R. Wickline Human trafficking bill gets panel OK A bill intended to allow victims of human trafficking to sue their abusers without having to meet criminal law standards advanced from a Senate committee Wednesday. Senate Bill 282 by Missy Irvin, R-Mountain View, passed the Committee on Judiciary in a voice vote without audible dissent. The panel's endorsement sends the bill to the full Senate for further consideration. The bill permits a human trafficking victim to bring a civil case in state court against a person or entity who knew "or should have known that the individual was or would be subjected to any form of trafficking." The person or entity would have also had to have caused, been responsible for, benefited financially from or received something of value from the human trafficking incident. Irvin said her bill mirrors standards used in federal anti-trafficking laws. The legislation would not prevent prosecutors from pursuing criminal charges against entities accused of human trafficking, she said. The legislation would protect hotels and motels against insurance policy coverage exclusion based on intentional conduct. Irvin said her bill would apply the general negligence standard of "knew or should have known," which hotels and motels use for insuring against other risks, to trafficking. The bill includes language specifying the fault of "a victim of human trafficking shall not be apportioned against the victim of human trafficking" in a civil case. -- Will Langhorne Concealed carry bill OK'd in House The Arkansas House on Wednesday approved a bill that would allow the concealed carry of handguns in Arkansas Department of Transportation buildings and on adjacent grounds. Senate Bill 211, by Sen. Missy Irvin, R-Mountain View, advanced to the governor's desk with a vote of 78-15. RJ Hawk, R-Bryant, the House sponsor of the bill, said the measure would allow people with enhanced concealed carry permits to bring firearms into buildings administered by the department. When enhanced concealed carry permits were established, holders were barred from carrying in several locations, including in courthouses, schools, law enforcement offices and state Department of Transportation buildings. Permit holders are currently allowed to carry on grounds administered by certain other state agencies. The bill would not allow people to carry concealed handguns in areas administered by the Arkansas Highway Police, Hawk said. The Arkansas Highway Police is a division within the state Department of Transportation. Officials with the Department of Transportation are in favor of the measure, Hawk told the House. He said the bill would allow employees who may carry weapons while out in the field to bring their firearms into administrative offices. -- Will Langhorne Teachers allowed to attend hearing Star City Superintendent Jordan Frizzell has responded to a claim made by Sen. Breanne Davis that his decision to give two teachers a personal day to speak on the LEARNS Act violated Department of Education policy. "Nice to have the Star City School District teachers & admin with us today to witness successful passage of #SB294," Davis tweeted Feb. 22, after the bill's hearing in the Senate Education Committee. "That does not excuse the fact that the superintendent allowed for blatant violation of its policy. @ArkEducation must investigate & hold leadership accountable." The policy Davis referred to bars schools from using school time, property, personnel or equipment from "furthering the interests of any political party, the campaign of any political candidate or the advocacy of any political issue or ballot issue whether partisan or non-partisan." Frizzell said in a Feb. 27 letter responding to Davis that he allowed two teachers from the school district professional leave to attend the hearing, and that was consistent with district policy that allows for professional leave for "meetings and conferences related to education." "Since the Senate Education Committee was directly related to education, and a significant piece of legislation that impacts teachers, this was absolutely an appropriate use of professional leave under our policy," Frizzell wrote. "Had Senator Davis contacted me with her concerns, I would have been pleased to share our District policy and the rationale for my decision." -- Neal Earley  Print Headline: State Capitol news in brief Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         100 years ago March 2, 1923 NEW YORK -- Fritz Roemmling and Catherine Plugger, sweetheart stowaways who arrived from Germany on the steamer Mount Clinton, have been ordered deported. Roemmling, attired as a seaman, walked casually aboard the vessel before she left Hamburg, and stowed away in the hold. Miss Plugger said she followed him via the anchor chain, which she climbed hand over hand. 50 years ago March 2, 1973 Al Allen, head of the Art Department at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, has won a $500 purchase award of the Brooks League for an accrylic construction, "Winter Waiting," that he entered in the Mid-South Exhibition at Memphis' Brooks Memorial Art Gallery. Allen's paintings have been accepted in 13 Mid-South exhibitions, including seven of the last eight. Last year, 22 of his works were accepted in 11 other juried shows. He won 10 awards. 25 years ago March 2, 1998 DES MOINES, Iowa -- With their father grinning ear-to-ear and their mother crying, the world's first surviving septuplets were together at home Sunday after the last two babies were released from the hospital. Natalie and Alexis McCaughey joined their brothers and sisters, who came home in January, in a small three-bedroom house in Carlisle where some 60 volunteers work shifts to care for the babies. "It's great, finally, everybody under one roof," said the babies' father, Kenny McCaughey, carrying the bundled-up girls in separate car seats as the family left Blank Children's Hospital in Des Moines. The four boys and three girls were born Nov. 19, about nine weeks early. 10 years ago March 2, 2013 It's the small touches like wood moulding and family-size kitchen tables that make the building at 1000 S. Main St. feel less like a former car dealership and more like a haven. The Veterans Day Treatment Center will open its doors Monday to provide services, including primary medical and psychological care, for central Arkansas veterans, many of whom are or have recently been homeless. The center run by the Central Arkansas Veterans Healthcare System is one of only a handful across the country to offer wide-ranging services from housing help to physical examinations and group therapy under one roof. "This is one of only a few centers in the country that operate in such a comprehensive way," said Estella Morris, the center's director. "We wanted this center to have those touches that made it feel a little more like home and so that the veterans could take ownership of it and feel rightly that their service was appreciated."

         The Arkansas Teacher Corps program will nearly double with the aid of a Walton Family Foundation grant. The $3.6 million grant will support 105 new teaching fellows through 2025, an 84% increase over the 57 fellows that the Arkansas Teacher Corps has supported for the past three years, according to the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville. The Arkansas Teacher Corps -- a partnership between UA-Fayetteville's College of Education and Health Professions, the Walton Family Foundation, the Arkansas Department of Education and participating Arkansas K-12 school districts -- provides an accelerated path to teaching at a time when many schools are contending with teacher shortages. "A crucial mission of the College of Education and Health Professions is to help address complex education and health challenges in the state, [and] the teacher shortage is definitely one of those challenges, which is why programs like ATC are so important, " said Dean Kate Mamiseishvili. "Each fellow receives essential development and coaching, which, in turn, affects every student they teach, [and] we are so proud of this program's impact across Arkansas." Highly effective teachers are paramount to student success, and "we are always happy to support innovative programs, such as the Arkansas Teacher Corps, that focus on recruiting exceptional teachers into the classroom," said Kimberly Mundell, director of communications for the Arkansas Department of Education. "When we employ the best and brightest teachers and improve access to a quality education, every student wins." The Arkansas Teacher Corps -- applicants need a four-year degree, but it can be in any major -- launched in 2013 with an inaugural cohort of 21 fellows teaching in nine school districts and 13 schools, according to UA-Fayetteville. Since then, the three-year program has recruited, trained, and supported 10 cohorts of more than 200 teachers in 81 schools and 37 school districts throughout central, east, and south Arkansas. This latest "grant provides us an opportunity to have an even greater impact by expanding our partnerships to new school districts throughout eastern and southern Arkansas," Brandon Lucius, the Arkansas Teacher Corps' executive director, said in a news release. "We'll also be able to provide additional support and development for teaching fellows, including rigorous content knowledge and pedagogical training, and wrap-around support for fellows' social and emotional well-being." Participants receive on-the-job training as full-time, paid teachers with partner school districts, a standard five-year teaching license upon program completion, and a $5,000 stipend, among other benefits, according to the university. Fellows also have access to study tools such as 240 Tutoring and Study.com subscriptions to help prepare for licensure testing. "The partnerships between ATC and school districts develop and retain high-quality teachers, while informing policies about the Arkansas teacher workforce," said Sarah McKenzie, executive director of the Office for Education Policy at UA-Fayetteville, an assistant research professor, and faculty director of the Arkansas Teacher Corps. "The support from the Walton Family Foundation provided the Department of Education Reform the opportunity to generate research-based insights about teacher development while meeting urgent needs of schools and students." Nearly 80% of fellows identify as a racial or ethnic minority, more than half are first-generation college students, and more than 80% are from low-income communities, according to UA-Fayetteville. In addition, two-thirds of fellows recruited in 2022 -- this school year, the program is supporting 60 fellows in 31 schools and 16 school districts across Arkansas -- are hometown applicants who are originally from the community or were already working in the school where they now teach. Thus far, 77 fellows have successfully completed this program and earned a standard five-year teaching license in one or more content areas, resulting in 150-plus total certifications, according to UA-Fayetteville. Of the alumni who have successfully completed the fellowships, 78% were still teaching and leading in Arkansas public schools a year later (four years of teaching total), and 59% were still teaching in Arkansas schools five years later (eight years of teaching total).

        ARKADELPHIA — Ninth West Judicial District Prosecuting Attorney Jana Bradford has been named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit involving her uncle, a convicted child sex offender. Bradford of Glenwood is one of six individuals named in the lawsuits amended complaint, along with two businesses owned by her uncle Barry Alan Walker, 58. The complaint is 164 pages long and claims Bradford and other family members “circled the wagons” to defend Walker and keep his businesses operating. The lawsuit was filed in Clark County Circuit Court. It claims Bradford was a deputy prosecuting attorney in the 9th West Judicial District of Arkansas at the time of the crimes and was a mandated reporter of child maltreatment under Arkansas Code 12-18-402. The plaintiffs are represented by Texarkana-based Mercy Carter Law Firm. Bradford is being sued in her individual capacity only and is not being sued in her capacity as a deputy prosecuting attorney or as the current elected prosecutor of the 9th West Judicial District, according to the lawsuit. Bradford was elected in May 2022 and began her four-year term in January. Walker was a physician until his license was suspended in 1999 after a conviction for sexual misconduct with a child in Fort Smith. Bradford and the other defendants were aware Walker was a registered sex offender, according to the lawsuit, and also knew Walker was at a risk of harming other prepubescent females if he did not continue his medical care, therapy and counseling. The lawsuit also states the defendants knew Walker needed to avoid high-risk behaviors such as drinking alcohol and high-risk situations such as being alone with young females. According to the lawsuit, the defendants knew Barry Walker had stopped receiving psychotherapy, was drinking alcohol and socializing with young girls. The family members would not allow their own daughters be alone with Barry Walker but did not take steps to protect other girls from him, according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit also claims Bradford made attempts to have Walker removed from the sex offender registry in 2018. In October 2022, Walker pleaded guilty to numerous counts of rape of a minor, computer exploitation of a child and other sexual crimes involving children and was given 18 life sentences without parole in Pike County and 21 in Clark County. Walker had been held in the Pike County jail since June 2022 when multiple charges were brought against him after a search of his home. Police found evidence that led to accusations that Walker assaulted 31 children in 34 separate incidents, according to reports. Bradford could not be reached for comment.

         Drug buy preceded arrest, police say North Little Rock police on Tuesday morning arrested a man on gun and drug charges after what they suspected was a drug sale, according to an arrest report. Officers encountered Jamarsae Baker, 30, of North Little Rock, around 10:15 a.m. after seeing him parked near 4601 North Hills Blvd. and entering other vehicles that pulled up beside him. Police said the behavior was consistent with that of someone selling drugs. Baker had a firearm and a "sizeable" amount of marijuana on his person, the report states. He faces three felony counts -- simultaneous possession of drugs and a gun, possession of a firearm by a certain person and drug possession. He was being held in the Pulaski County jail on Wednesday night, according to the jail's online inmate roster. Machine gun found in officers' search The Arkansas State Police on Tuesday arrested a man who had an illegal machine gun, according to an arrest report. A state trooper pulled over a vehicle in which Trameini Johnson, 23, of North Little Rock, was a passenger around 11:30 a.m. near 400 Pershing Blvd. for having an illegal window tint, the report says. Police had earlier seen the vehicle parked in a gas station parking lot for around 45 minutes and had then observed Johnson with a gun in his hoodie, according to the report. When officers found the weapon on Johnson's person, it was found to have been modified to fire fully automatically, the report says. Johnson is a convicted felon and cannot legally own a gun. He faces felony charges of possessing a machine gun and possession of a firearm by a certain person. He was being held in the Pulaski County jail Wednesday night, according to the jail's online inmate roster. Traffic stop yields firearms, drugs A North Little Rock man faces multiple felony charges after he was arrested during a traffic stop late Tuesday, according to an arrest report. North Little Rock officers pulled over Donald Bowers, 30, around 10:22 p.m. off Interstate 40 and reported smelling marijuana in the vehicle, leading to a search. Bowers told officers he had a handgun, and the search located guns, marijuana, methamphetamine, cocaine, ecstasy and a digital scale, the report says. He faces four drug possession counts and charges of simultaneous possession of drugs and a gun and possession of drug paraphernalia, all felonies. Bowers was being held in the Pulaski County jail Wednesday night, according to the jail's online inmate roster. Gun stolen, police learn after stop The Arkansas State Police early Wednesday arrested a Little Rock man who they say had a stolen weapon during a traffic stop, according to an arrest report. A trooper pulled over Tyler Lipsie, 22, around 1:50 a.m. on Interstate 430 near mile marker 2 because he had a defective headlight and nonworking license plate lights, the report says. The officer reported smelling marijuana in the vehicle, leading to a search and the discovery of a Glock 19 pistol that had been reported stolen in Little Rock, about 14 grams of marijuana and a digital scale, the report says. Lipsie faces felony counts of theft by receiving of a firearm and drug possession, a misdemeanor charge of carrying a weapon and citations for driving without a license or on an expired license and having nonworking headlight and license plate lights. He was being held in the Pulaski County jail Wednesday night in lieu of $4,500 bond, according to the jail's online inmate roster.

         Beginning next school year, the Pine Bluff School District will operate just one high school and one junior high school "in order to be good fiscal agents," Superintendent Jennifer Barbaree announced in a video released Wednesday. Barbaree announced "her intention" to close Jack Robey Junior High School and to have all seventh-, eighth- and ninth-grade students attend the present Robert F. Morehead Middle School campus with the possibility the present Dollarway High School will be used to hold some of the students. Meanwhile, all 10th-, 11th- and 12th-grade students will attend Pine Bluff High School. The decision comes nearly two years after the Dollarway School District was annexed into the PBSD. Barbaree said in the video she met with each campus principal and visited all nine district campuses to inform faculty and staff of the upcoming changes, making good on a statement she made following a school board work session last Thursday when she publicly indicated the district cannot financially support as many campuses after this school year. The decisions announced Wednesday must be made in order for the district to leave state control. "I want to be clear that the main reason for closing Jack Robey is for financial reasons," Barbaree told The Commercial. "We received a quote for a new HVAC system, and we would use ESSER [Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief] funding, but if we put in a new HVAC system, we'd have to replace the roof. The quote for that is 12 to 13 million dollars." Jack Robey, located on South Olive Street, opened in 1986 as Pine Bluff Junior High School and was renamed in honor of the late PBSD superintendent the following year. Morehead, located on Fluker Avenue, was renovated from the old Townsend Park Elementary in 1999 after a 1997 fire damaged the old campus. Dollarway High, located across the street from Morehead, was renovated from the old Dollarway Junior High School in 2009 and named after a board member in the Dollarway School District, in 2010. It was converted to Dollarway High in 2016 after the former district was forced to close the old campus on Dollarway Road. The Morehead and Dollarway High campuses are newer, more conducive to learning and don't cost as much to maintain as Jack Robey, Barbaree explained.  But as for merging the Dollarway and Pine Bluff High student bodies, she said that decision was best for the students based on finances and the classroom experience. Pine Bluff High currently enrolls 583 students in grades 10-12, and Dollarway High enrolls 163 in the same grades. All high school and junior high athletic teams and activity clubs will be known as the Pine Bluff Zebras and junior high Zebras, Barbaree said. "We cannot afford to function as two high schools," Barbaree said. "We have a little over 100 students at Dollarway High, and we can't staff that when we have another high school that can take those students in. It's not fair to the teams at Dollarway struggling to get participation up in sports and other activities. They don't have the facilities and such things that Pine Bluff High has." Geographically, the entire PBSD will be represented with the mergers, Barbaree said. STAFFING Some staff members will be reassigned and some positions will be eliminated as a result of the mergers, Barbaree revealed in the video. "It is not my intention to do a RIF," she said, referring to a reduction-in-force. "However, I will recommend to the school board ... to non-renew our faculty that are non-licensed. I know we are going to need some of our non-licensed employees, so some of those decisions will be made as soon as possible as far as hiring back, based on student needs." Barbaree reiterated the district's plan to build a new campus, clarifying a location has not yet been determined. Public sentiment, however, has favored a rebuild of the present PBHS at 711 W. 11th Ave. Under the cost-share agreement with the Arkansas Department of Education to construct a new high school, Barbaree said, most of the buildings at PBHS must be demolished, regardless where the district decides to construct a new campus. This is because the partnership is based on a space replacement. It is possible the PBSD elementary schools will be reconfigured, Barbaree added. Presently prekindergarten students attend Forrest Park/Greenville Preschool, and kindergartners through sixth graders attend Broadmoor, James Matthews, Southwood and 34th Avenue elementaries.

        The National Weather Service has issued a flash-flood warning for Arkadelphia, Malvern and White Hall until 11:20 p.m. Wednesday, one of a string of alerts issued throughout the evening. The agency had previously issued a flash-flood warning for Mena, Wickes, and Hatfield until 9:15 p.m. Wednesday. — Arkansas Democrat-Gazette 6:30 p.m.: The National Weather Service has issued a severe thunderstorm warning for Hot Springs, Hot Springs Village and Piney until 7 p.m. Wednesday, even as the tornado warning for the same three cities expired a half-hour earlier than originally projected. The thunderstorm warning for those cities included the possibility of hail the size of ping-pong balls. Alerts were also issued for Stuttgart, Clarendon and Hazen until 7 p.m. Wednesday, including 40 mph winds and half-inch sized hail. A separate warning for Alpine, Murfreesboro and Amity until 6:45 p.m. Wednesday included 50 mph winds and penny-sized hail. Alpine and Murfreesboro were also under a severe thunderstorm warning issued at 6:26 p.m. Wednesday. That warning, which also includes Glenwood, was set to expire at 7:15 p.m. Wednesday and includes a chance of 60 mph winds and quarter-sized hail. — Daniel McFadin 6:12 p.m.: The National Weather Service issued a tornado warning for Hot Springs, Hot Springs Village and Piney until 6:45 p.m. Wednesday. The alert affects an area that includes roughly 107,000 people. — Daniel McFadin 5:47 p.m.: The National Weather Service has issued a flash flood warning for Mena, Wickes, and Hatfield until 9:15 p.m. It also issued a severe thunderstorm warning for Mount Ida, Norman and Black Springs until 6:15 p.m. That alert affects around 7,319 people. — Daniel McFadin 4:59 p.m.: Around 4:30 p.m. Wednesday, the National Weather issued a severe thunderstorm warning for Hazen, De Valls Bluff and Humnoke until 5:15 p.m. The alert warns of 60 mph wind and quarter-sized hail. Roughly 5,138 people fall under the warning. Just after 4:50 p.m., the NWS also issued a severe thunderstorm warning for Hatfield, Cove and Vandervoort lasting until 5:45 p.m. The alert covers a population of roughly 5,657 and two schools. — Daniel McFadin 3:38 p.m.: Tornado watch issued for southern two-thirds of Arkansas Just after 3:30 p.m. Wednesday, the National Weather Service in North Little Rock issued a tornado watch for 23 Arkansas counties until 10 p.m. The counties are Arkansas, Bradley, Clark, Cleveland, Dallas, Desha, Drew, Faulkner, Garland, Hot Spring, Jefferson, Lincoln, Lonoke, Monroe, Montgomery, Nevada, Ouachita, Perry, Pike, Prairie, Pulaski, Saline and White. The watch also covers parts of Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas. Once storms develop, initial discrete cells will be capable of large hail. Any cells that can become surface based near the Arkansas-Louisiana border will support some risk for tornadoes, given adequate low-level wind shear. As the low level windjet gradually strengthens in the late afternoon and evening, elongating shear profiles and increasing shear should support a greater risk for tornadoes, according to the National Weather Service. — Daniel McFadin 1:42 p.m.: Forecasters: Storms bring chance for baseball-sized hail, tornadoes in Arkansas The risk for severe weather on Wednesday and Thursday has increased across portions of Arkansas, bringing chances for baseball-sized hail and tornadoes, according to the National Weather Service. Strong to severe storms are expected to develop throughout the afternoon and evening on Wednesday, a briefing from the weather service states. A flood watch for nearly all but the southern third of the state will go into place during the afternoon. “An enhanced risk for severe thunderstorms has been introduced across much of central and southern portions of the state,” the weather service said in a tweet on Wednesday morning.  An enhanced risk of severe weather means that forecasters have “high confidence that several storms will contain damaging winds, severe hail, and/or tornado potential,” a briefing from the weather service said Wednesday. Parts of central, southwest and eastern Arkansas are included in an enhanced risk for severe weather on Wednesday, according to forecasters.  The tornado potential for Wednesday increased from very low to low on Tuesday. Storms on Wednesday now have the potential to produce baseball sized hail and winds up to 60 mph, the weather service in North Little Rock said. “Widespread heavy rainfall and antecedent saturated soil surfaces will pose an elevated threat for flash flooding across most of the northern half of the state over the next few days,” the briefing said.  Parts of west and southwestern Arkansas will start seeing storms midafternoon on Wednesday, according to the briefing. Storms will be in central, northern, northwestern and southern portions of the state by late afternoon and early evening. Northeast Arkansas is expected to see rain in the evening and early hours overnight.  Due to the rain, a flood watch will take effect Wednesday afternoon and continue through Friday morning, according to forecasters.  The storms on Wednesday are “just a precursor to the main severe weather event on Thursday,” the briefing said.  A regional outbreak of severe weather, including the possibility for strong and violent tornadoes, appears likely for Thursday, forecasters said.  “A concerning amount of instability and wind energy will fuel more numerous severe storms on Thursday and Thursday night,” the briefing said.  Forecasters are predicting that storms on Thursday will have a high potential for tornadoes, hail as big as a baseball and wind speeds exceeding 80 mph, according to the briefing.  Southwestern and southern parts of the state have now increased to a moderate risk of severe weather for Thursday, forecasters said.  A moderate risk is defined by forecasters as having “a high confidence that many storms will contain damaging winds, severe hail, and/or tornadoes,” according to the weather briefing. Storms associated with this risk are intense and an area may only experience them once a year or less. The KLZK radar is back in service after it went offline Monday night, the weather service in North Little Rock announced in a separate Twitter post just before 1:30 p.m. on Wednesday. Dennis Cavanaugh, a meteorologist with the weather service, said earlier Wednesday afternoon before the tweet that technicians were installing replacement parts and testing the radar. He said the weather service in North Little Rock was still ready to provide the same service the public has come to expect, even if the radar remained offline. “If the only tool we had were the back-up radars, it would likely degrade our services, but those are not all we have,” Cavanaugh said. While forecasters have already pulled up back-up radars to track the storms expected on Wednesday, the weather service also uses information from storm spotters, community partnerships and satellites. — Remington Miller Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        If the Arkansas Supreme Court grants the states motion to dismiss an appeal for new DNA testing in the West Memphis Three case, the request will be filed again in a different county, attorneys for Damien Echols wrote in an Arkansas Supreme Court filing on Wednesday. “Granting of the States motion effects nothing but delay into the processing of Echols petition,” according to his attorneys. Citing a boxing maneuver meant to tire out opponents, they wrote, “The Court should decline to endorse this ‘rope-a-dope strategy by the State.” The issue involves jurisdiction. Echols, along with Jason Baldwin and Jessie Misskelley, were convicted in 1994 of the slayings of three 8-year-old boys — Christopher Byers, Steve Branch and Michael Moore — whose bodies were found in a drainage ditch near West Memphis the previous year. Echols was sentenced to death. The homicides occurred in Crittenden County, but Echols received a change of venue to Craighead County, where he was tried and convicted. No DNA evidence ever linked the three to the deaths, and they were released from prison in 2011 after prosecutors allowed them to walk free as part of a deal known as an Alford plea, which was also entered in Craighead County Circuit Court. An Alford plea is a guilty plea in criminal court. By taking an Alford plea, a defendant does not admit to the criminal act and asserts their innocence, but agrees that the evidence presented by the prosecution would be likely to persuade a judge or jury to find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Since then, the defendants have been trying to clear their names. Attorneys representing Echols petitioned Crittenden County Circuit Court on Jan. 24, 2022, to permit new M-Vac wet-vacuum DNA testing on sneaker laces that were used to hogtie the three boys. This type of DNA testing wasnt available when previous DNA tests were done on evidence from the crime scene, according to the court filing. Crittenden County Circuit Judge Tonya Alexander denied Echols request in June, stating that he wasnt entitled to the evidence examination because the law only allows incarcerated convicts the opportunity to seek new evidence testing. Echols appealed the decision to the Arkansas Supreme Court. On Feb. 21, Assistant Attorney General Brooke Jackson Gasaway filed a motion saying Echols appeal should be dismissed because he filed his initial request in the wrong county. “Echols is appealing the Crittenden County Circuit Courts denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus under Act 1780 of 2001,” wrote Gasaway. “His conviction, however, was entered in the Craighead County Circuit Court in case number CR-93-540A. “Under Ark. Code Ann. § 16-112-201(a) (Repl. 2016), an Act 1780 habeas petition must be filed in the circuit court where the judgment of ‘conviction was entered. Because Echols filed his petition in the wrong county, this court should dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.” But Echols attorneys — John R. Elrod of Fayetteville, Patrick J. Benca of Little Rock and Stephen L. Braga of Washington, D.C. — say thats irrelevant. According to Wednesday's filing, both Crittenden and Craighead counties are in Arkansas 2nd Judicial Circuit. They cite a 2020 case, Williams v. State, in which the Arkansas Supreme Court confronted a situation where a defendant “alleged that a jurisdictional violation occurred because he entered his plea in Desha County and not in Chicot County, where the crime was committed and the judgment was entered.” Desha and Chicot counties are both in Arkansas 10th Judicial Circuit. The Supreme Court found that this “present[ed] issues of local jurisdiction,” rather than “subject matter jurisdiction,” according to Echols filing. Circuit judges have “the authority to preside over proceedings in any courtroom, in any county, within the judicial district for which that judge was elected.” The parties cant waive a courts lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, according to Echols attorneys. They note that Prosecuting Attorney Keith L. Chrestman agreed to waive venue for the purpose of the circuit court hearing before Judge Alexander in Crittenden County in June. “[V]enue and jurisdiction, though sometimes used interchangeably, are two distinct legal concepts,” Echols attorneys wrote, citing a 1994 case, Davis v. Reed. “Venue is the geographic area, like a county, where an action is brought to trail. Jurisdiction is the power of a court to decide cases and presupposes the control over the subject matter and parties.” Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        Beginning this fall, the Pine Bluff School District will operate just one high school and one junior high school “in order to be good fiscal agents,” Superintendent Jennifer Barbaree announced in a video released Wednesday, a little less than two years after Dollarway schools officially became part of the district. Barbaree announced her “intention” to close Jack Robey Junior High School and to have all seventh-, eighth- and ninth-grade students attend the present Robert F. Morehead Middle School campus, adding that the present Dollarway High School could be used to hold some of the students. Meanwhile, all 10th-, 11th- and 12th-grade students will attend Pine Bluff High School. Barbaree said in the video that she met with each campus principal and visited all nine district campuses to inform faculty and staff of the upcoming changes, making good on a statement she made after a school board work session last Thursday when she publicly indicated that the district cannot financially support so many campuses. Officials said the decisions announced Wednesday were required in order for the district to leave state control.  “I want to be clear that the main reason for closing Jack Robey is for financial reasons,” Barbaree told The Commercial. “We received a quote for a new HVAC system, and we would use ESSER [Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief] funding, but if we put in a new HVAC system, wed have to replace the roof. The quote for that is $12 [million] to $13 million.” Jack Robey, located on South Olive Street, opened in 1986 as Pine Bluff Junior High School and was renamed in honor of the late Pine Bluff School District superintendent the following year. Morehead, located on Fluker Avenue, was renovated from the old Townsend Park Elementary in 1999 after a 1997 fire damaged the old campus. Dollarway High was renovated from the old Dollarway Junior High School in 2009. It was named after Morehead, a board member in the Dollarway School District, in 2010, then was converted to Dollarway High in 2016 after the Dollarway School District was forced to close the old campus on Dollarway Road. The Morehead and Dollarway High campuses are newer, more conducive to learning and dont cost as much to maintain as Jack Robey, Barbaree explained. The superintendent added that merging the Dollarway and Pine Bluff High student bodies was best for the students, based on finances and the classroom experience. Pine Bluff High currently enrolls 583 students in grades 10-12, and Dollarway High enrolls 163 in the same grades. All high school and junior high athletic teams and activity clubs will be known as the Pine Bluff Zebras, Barbaree said. “We cannot afford to function as two high schools,” Barbaree said. “We have a little over 100 students at Dollarway High, and we cant staff that when we have another high school that can take those students in. Its not fair to the teams at Dollarway struggling to get participation up in sports and other activities. They dont have the facilities and such things that Pine Bluff High has.” Geographically, the entire Pine Bluff School District will be represented with the mergers, Barbaree said. STAFFING Some staff members will be reassigned and some positions will be eliminated as a result of the mergers, Barbaree revealed in the video. “It is not my intention to do a RIF,” she said, referring to a reduction-in-force. “However, I will recommend to the school board … to non-renew our faculty that are non-licensed. I know we are going to need some of our non-licensed employees, so some of those decisions will be made as soon as possible as far as hiring back, based on student needs.” BUILDINGS Barbaree reiterated the districts plan to build a new campus, clarifying that a location has not yet been determined. Public sentiment, however, has favored a rebuild of the present Pine Bluff High School at 711 W. 11th Ave. Barbaree said that most of the buildings at Pine Bluff High School must be demolished, regardless where the district decides to construct a new campus. This is because the cost-share agreement with the Arkansas Department of Education to construct a new high school is based on a space replacement. It is possible that the Pine Bluff School District's elementary schools will be reconfigured, Barbaree added. Presently prekindergarten students attend Forrest Park/Greenville Preschool, and children in grades kindergarten through six attend Broadmoor, James Matthews, Southwood and 34th Avenue elementaries.

        The House Education Committee forwarded Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders education overhaul Wednesday, sending the bill to the House of Representatives floor for a vote. The committee approved the bill on a voice vote, and it will head to the House floor Thursday for a vote, House Speaker Matthew Shepherd said. The committees vote comes after seven hours of public testimony Tuesday with 94 members of the public signing up to speak for and against the bill during the hearing. “Ultimately when you look at the bill in its entirety, what we all want is to finally do something that will take our state from the bottom of the rankings, where we are year after year, and deliver something big and bold for Arkansas and for the students,” said Rep. Grant Hodges, R-Centerton. The bill passed the Senate last week. If approved by the House, it will have to move back to the Senate for a concurring vote before it is sent to Sanders for action. Senate Bill 294, also known as the LEARNS Act, is Sanders education reform bill. The Republican govern has described it as her top legislative priority since taking office in January. The 144-page bill is an omnibus package that Sanders said is “the most bold, comprehensive, conservative education reform package in the nation.” The bill includes a phased-in voucher program that will give students 90% of foundation funding to attend a private or home school. The bill also calls for a $14,000 increase in the starting salary for teachers and funding for literacy coaches to boost reading levels for elementary students. Rep. Denise Garner, D-Fayetteville, took issue with the bills voucher program, saying studies have shown they do not work “Vouchers do not support students with disabilities and it does exasperate segregation, skirt accountability and transparency, funds discrimination and leaves underserved students and communities behind,” Garner said. CORRECTION: Denise Garner is a Democratic state representative from Fayetteville. An earlier version of this story incorrectly identified her party affiliation.

        A 19-year-old man was taken to a hospital after being stabbed in an off-road park on Sunday, authorities said.  The victim was stabbed around 1:30 a.m. on Sunday in Carter Off-Road Park, 7498 Anderson St., on the county line between Pulaski and Saline counties, a news release from the Pulaski County sheriffs office said Sunday.  He was said to be “in serious condition,” according to the release.  Lt. Cody Burk, a spokesman for the sheriffs office, said the victim was released from the hospital as of Wednesday afternoon. The sheriffs office said Memphis Ketelsen, a suspect in the stabbing, was located and arrested by Bryant police on unrelated charges, according to the release.  An online roster for the Saline County jail showed that Ketelsen, 19, of Alexander, had been released at 4:15 p.m.  on Monday. It also showed he had a $10,000 bond.  The roster also showed that Ketelsen had been charged with resisting arrest, second-degree criminal mischief, first-degree terroristic threatening and two counts of second-degree battery on a law enforcement officer.  Burk said Wednesday that the Pulaski County sheriffs office investigation into the stabbing was still ongoing.  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        Aspiring country pop artist Marybeth Byrd times her auditions around graduations.  Byrd, 21, first auditioned for singing competition show “The Voice” in 2019, the same year she graduated from Armorel High School.  She made it to the Top 8 while competing on John Legends team during season 17 of the show.  Now Byrd, set to graduate from Arkansas State University in the spring, will be auditioning in front of celebrity judges on Sundays “American Idol.” Byrd, a strategic communications major at ASU, said she has always loved music.  “I am an artist of many layers. I sound country but sometimes I sing pop,” said Byrd, “I love my falsetto, my head voice, thats considered pop. Country is the base of everything for me, so country pop.”  She said that gospel and southern influences are really shown in her music.  Byrd, who has not seen her episode yet, will be seen on TVs across the country auditioning in front of Katy Perry, Lionel Richie and Luke Bryan along with her guitarist Charles Moody, who she brought from home.  She said she will probably just stay in and watch the episode in her bed with her dog, but she received word from her family about watch parties.  “I am really blessed to have grown up in a small town because you know everyone,” Byrd said Tuesday, “And it just feels like one big family.”  Byrd said shes always lived in Armorel, an unincorporated community in Mississippi County, with a population of just over 300 people.  Her childhood consisted of a lot of four-wheeler riding and family time, she said. “My grandparents helped raise me, you know being in a southern family youre just always so close,” the singer said.  “Folsom Prison Blues” by Johnny Cash is the song that she says always reminds her of growing up in the state.  “Our house was always the ‘neighborhood house where my brother would have all of his friends and people would come over just to have dinners all the time,” Byrd said, “It was just southern hospitality at its finest.”  Byrd said she hopes to keep building relationships with other artists through “American Idol,” something she's learned after reflecting on her time as a contestant on “The Voice.”  “On top of being a 17-year-old doing something that big and not really knowing who I was as an artist or as a person, I also lost my grandpa, someone who was really important to me, in the midst of that,” Byrd said, “It was all of these different things in one that I wasnt ready for.”  She said that now, four years later, shes started finding herself though growing up and welcoming adulthood.  She said she's matured in the four years since "The Voice," and has started finding herself as she welcomes adulthood.  “I feel like ‘American Idol is what Ive been waiting on. I feel like its a stepping stone towards my future,” Byrd said, “I am over the moon about the whole thing." Byrd said that while it is easy to get lost in friendships shes built with others auditioning, including Holly Groves Lucy Love, shes reminding herself that shes auditioning to start a career.  “The whole winning thing kind of gets shoved to the back of your mind, for me,” She said, “Its just been so fun getting to watch all of my friends perform and do their thing." Byrd said it means a lot to her to get to represent Arkansas while auditioning.  “I wouldnt want to live in any other state, though I hope Nashville is in my future” she said, “Arkansas is where my heart is. I have a love for this place like no other.” Byrd said she wants to inspire young girls who have also grown up in small towns. “I think artists who grew up in small towns can feel out of their element when they love music, because there arent as many opportunities here compared to Nashville or Los Angeles,” the singer said, “I want to tell them that they can do it, too.”  “Success is not an overnight thing," Byrd said. "Even when there is pressure to be the next best thing tomorrow, take one step at a time.”  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        The body of a man found Feb. 20 in a Jonesboro pond has been identified, police said Monday. Felipe Morales Nava, 45, was identified by the state Crime Laboratory on Friday by using “fingerprint analysis,” Jonesboro police said on Facebook. The Crime Lab noted that there were “no obvious signs of injuries or foul play,” the Facebook post said.  “This death will be ruled as an apparent drowning,” the post said. Nava was found on Feb. 20 by a resident who then called the Jonesboro Police Department, according to the post. The body was found in the 900 block of East Lakeshore Drive, just south of East Matthews Avenue and about a mile southwest of the Arkansas State University campus. Officers did not find a way to identify the body at that time, so it was transported to the Crime Lab for an autopsy and identification, police said.  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        ARKADELPHIA — Ninth West Judicial District Prosecutor Jana Bradford has been named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit involving her uncle, a convicted child sex offender. Bradford, of Glenwood, is one of six individuals named in the lawsuit's amended complaint, along with two businesses owned by her uncle Barry Alan Walker, 58. The complaint is 164 pages long and claims Bradford and other family members "circled the wagons" to defend Barry Walker and keep his businesses operating. The lawsuit was filed in Clark County circuit court. It claims Bradford was a deputy prosecuting attorney in the Ninth West Judicial District of Arkansas at the time of the crimes and was a mandated reporter of child maltreatment under Arkansas code 12-18-402. The plaintiffs are represented by Texarkana-based Mercy Carter Law Firm. Bradford is being sued in her individual capacity only and is not being sued in her capacity as a deputy prosecuting attorney or as the current elected prosecutor of the Ninth West Judicial District, according to the lawsuit. Bradford was elected in May 2022 and began her four-year term in January. Walker was a physician until his license was suspended in 1999 after a conviction for sexual misconduct with a child in Fort Smith. The lawsuit claims Bradford and the other defendants were aware Walker was a registered sex offender and also knew Walker was at a risk of harming other prepubescent females if he did not continue his medical care, therapy and counseling. The lawsuit also states the defendants knew Walker needed to avoid high-risk behaviors such as drinking alcohol and high-risk situations such as being alone with young females. According to the lawsuit, the defendants knew Walker had stopped receiving psychotherapy, was drinking alcohol and socializing with young girls. The family members would not allow their own daughters be alone with Barry Walker but "neither took steps to protect other prepubescent females from Barry Walker" according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit also claims Bradford made attempts to have Walker removed from the sex offender registry in 2018. In October 2022, Walker pleaded guilty to numerous counts of rape of a minor, computer exploitation of a child, producing and other sexual crimes involving children and was given 18 life sentences without parole in Pike County and 21 in Clark County. Walker had been held in the Pike County Detention Center since June 2022 when multiple charges were brought against him after a search of his home. Police found evidence that led to accusations that Walker assaulted 31 children in 34 separate incidents, according to reports. Bradford could not be reached for comment.

        An El Dorado man has been charged with rape, kidnapping, first-degree criminal mischief, interference with emergency communications, third-degree domestic battery and endangering the welfare of a minor following the attack and sexual assault of a Camden woman he had previously been in a relationship with. Chance Rogers, 29, was released on a $100,000 bond from Judge Ryan Phillips on Jan. 23. According to an affidavit from the Camden Police Department, on Jan. 23, officers responded to the Ouachita County Medical Center in reference to a sexual assault. The victim in the case told police Rogers drove to her home, where she lives with her young child, and attacked her, choking her in her bedroom before violently sexually assaulting her, according to the affidavit. She alleged that after the assault, she escaped the bedroom and hid in her car, where Rogers, she said, continued to harass her, including by ripping the handle off her vehicle and trying to puncture her tires. Rogers then brought her child out of the house to force her to exit the vehicle, she claimed. When she followed them inside her house, Rogers dragged her around by her hair and punched her repeatedly in the stomach and genitals, she told police. The victim reported punching Rogers in the face and scratching his neck in self-defense. After Rogers left her home, the woman reportedly went to Ouachita County Medical Center where police saw that her left elbow was bruised, right hand was swollen and she had bruises on her left thigh. Carpet burn was also indicated on her buttocks, according to police. The affidavit states that when Rogers was arrested he did not want to give a statement because "women are always the victim." The report notes that Rogers had injuries consistent with the victim's statement. According to court records, Rogers was previously convicted in 2019 of terroristic threatening. He was sentenced to five years probation in that case. Print Headline: Local man charged with rape, kidnapping Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        Members of the public had their second chance weigh in on Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders' education overhaul during a marathon meeting Tuesday as the bill continues to make its way through the state Legislature. The House Committee on Education took no action on the bill, with chair Brian Evans, R-Cabot, saying he wanted to give members time to mull over public comments before a scheduled debate and vote today. Tuesday's meeting began at 9 a.m. before breaking for approximately two-and-a-half hours, resuming and ultimately finishing up shortly after 9 p.m. [LIVE VIDEO: House Education Committee to meet at 2:45 p.m. » arkansasonline.com/31panel/] The bill, which calls for a phased-in voucher program that will provide 90% of per-student state foundation funding for students to attend a private or home school, has become an object of contentious debate that has drawn criticism from teachers and praise from school choice activists. The bill also calls for a $14,000 raise in the starting salary for Arkansas teachers, which would boost the state's minimum pay for educators to among the highest in the nation. Last week the Senate approved Senate Bill 294, also known as the Arkansas LEARNS Act, and if approved by the House the legislation would have to move back to the Senate for a concurring vote before heading to Sanders for action. The bill's House sponsor, Rep. Keith Brooks, R-Little Rock, presented the bill in front of a packed hearing room inside one of the Legislature's largest meeting rooms at the multi-agency complex, also known as Big MAC. In total, 94 people signed up to testify for and against the bill Tuesday, with police asking some people to leave the hearing room because it was well beyond capacity. Members of the public took turns for about eight hours giving lawmakers their thoughts on the bill. "This bold vision that Gov. Sanders has put forward in partnership with the General Assembly represents the most aggressive and focused education package in the history of our great state and likely the nation," Brooks said. "Arkansas LEARNS is our call to arms." VOUCHERS Sanders' education bill calls for a voucher program, called Educational Freedom Accounts, which will provide students with 90% of foundation funding from the prior school year. For the 2022-2023 school year the foundation per student was $7,413. The voucher program will be phased in over three years, beginning with the 2023-2024 school year. The program will be open first to students in F-rated schools enrolled in kindergarten who were or are in a foster care program, have a disability or have an active-duty military parent. For the 2024-2025 school year, the voucher program will expand to students attending a D-rated school; who have a parent who is a military veteran; or who are children of first responders. By the 2025-2026 school year, every student who is eligible to enroll in a public school will be eligible for a voucher to attend a private or home school. The bill's school vouchers were the most debated issue during Tuesday's hearing, with critics arguing the vouchers would effectively defund public schools, while proponents said the Educational Freedom Accounts would tie public dollars to students instead of to schools. "Instead of taking all of this additional money and putting it into vouchers and transportation, competitive grants and all of these things, let's put it in folks' school," said Deanna Klaus, a seventh-grade math teacher. "Public tax dollars belong in the public schools where we can educate all of our students." Many of the parents who spoke in favor of the bill said they had children with special needs who need intensive care that many public schools could not offer. Cassandra Bone spoke in favor of the legislation, saying public schools generally aren't equipped to serve students with special needs. Bone said her child was able to attend Compass Academy in Conway, a private, non-profit school for children with developmental disabilities, thanks to a scholarship. "My child, who was barely speaking, is doing multiplication," she said. "Every child should have the opportunity if they don't fit the mold." The voucher program would cost the state $46.7 million in the first year and $97.5 million in the second, according to an analysis from the state Department of Education. The analysis estimates 7,000 students in the first year and 14,000 in the second year will take advantage of the voucher program. In the third year, when every student in the state would be eligible for vouchers, public funding will be prorated on a per-need basis. "I know that we say that school choice is an option, but we have no schools that are A or B schools in our area," said Jessie McGruder, an educator from West Memphis. Kevin Tipton, a member of the Cabot School Board, said the bill had a lot of benefits, including expansion of pre-kindergarten education, grants for tutors and literacy coaches to help students who are not reading at-grade level. He also said he was pleased with the bill's increased starting pay for teachers and the bill's "dual track" diploma, which would allow high school students to focus their education on a skill or trade. Tipton summed up his support for the bill by quoting a question from his grandfathers, who he said he considered his "political talking buddies." "Each of them would ask me: Does the good that this creates outweigh the concerns? The answer to that is yes," Tipton said. Heath Bennett, superintendent of Haskell Harmony Grove School, opposed the bill and questioned how state officials would find the funding to cover its provisions. Bennett said the bill's voucher program would do little to help students in his district, some of whom take more than two-hour bus rides to school. "It's very disheartening to listen to how public schools fail all the time," he said. "If you look at my ACT scores, you may wonder how I'm a superintendent. I was very blessed to have people who believed in me a long time ago. That's what public schools do." Amanda Escue, an administrator at Lighthouse, a home school cooperative in northeast Arkansas, echoed a refrain many in favor of the bill mentioned, that public schools do not work for all students. "The current model is not successful for all children, and I speak specifically about special learning," she said. TEACHER SALARIES Under the bill, starting salaries for teachers would increase from $36,000 to $50,000 a year, which would place Arkansas fourth in the nation for starting teacher pay, according to the National Education Association, the largest teacher union in the country. Additionally, each teacher will receive a $2,000 raise and could earn up to $10,000 in bonus pay for high test scores or teaching in a geographic or subject area of high need. Most who testified Tuesday said they favored the increase in starting pay for teachers, noting that with Arkansas' relatively low cost of living it would make the state an attractive landing spot for new educators. The new starting salaries also would mean a change to the state's complicated pay schedule for teachers, which rewards educators for experience and education. The bill would require school districts to adopt their own pay schedules, Brooks said. Administrators from smaller school districts worried whether they could afford the increase in starting pay. The bill would set aside state funding for increased teacher pay, requiring schools to pay teachers at least 80% of what the state recommends they do as a part of its funding formula for schools, also known as the matrix. "I do see this as causing great stress on my small schools," said Rep. DeAnn Vaught, R-Horatio. THE PROCESS The idea that lawmakers are hastily pushing through Sanders' education package is one of the main criticisms the bill's sponsors have received since introducing the legislation Feb. 20. Brooks and Senate sponsor Breanne Davis, R-Russellville, filed the bill last Monday. About 40 hours later the Senate Education Committee held a public hearing on the bill, with the Senate debating and voting on the bill Thursday. "Sen. Davis and I -- and others -- joined Gov. Sanders in the Delta over a month ago to listen to educators and administrators about their real world challenges and how they would best address those needs," Brooks said. "And so, the reality is that Arkansas LEARNS is not some sort of haphazardly created blueprint that was written one day and filed the next." Some complained, however, including some Republican lawmakers, that the public was not given enough time to thoroughly read the 144-page bill. "There's not one superintendent in my local area that had any boots on the ground from a member of this body or the Senate or got a call as this was being put together," said William Roundtree, superintendent of Carlisle Public Schools. OTHER COMMENTS The bill also calls for the repeal of the Teacher Fair Dismissal Act, the state law that requires educators be given written notice before being fired. Brooks said an amendment that he filed Friday would add back in some due protections for teachers to have a hearing before being fired. He said the repeal of the law would allow school districts to fire poor-performing teachers. Rep. Steven Walker, R-Horseshoe Bend, asked how the school would evaluate "non-testing" teachers such as physical education and music teachers. State Education Secretary Jacob Oliva said each school district will come up with ways to evaluate "non-testing" school districts. Rep. Ron McNair, R-Harrison, asked what input the public would have in the rule-making authority the legislation prescribes for the Department of Education, saying it seems that only after the bill's passage would bureaucrats and lawmakers determine how the bill will work. Brooks said the public will be a part of the rule-making process.   Gallery: Arkansas General Assembly - 2/28/23  Print Headline: Public weighs in on LEARNS Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

In a news release Monday, the Arkansas State Police said Candace Conners, 72, of Sherwood had been arrested on a charge of leaving the scene of an accident involving physical injury or death, a felony, in the collision that killed Lawrence “Gage” Gates, 22, of Jacksonville. Gates was found dead on the morning of Sept. 2, 2022, in a yard next to Arkansas 107 near West Cleveland Road in Pulaski County, police said. He had last been seen by his mother around 3 p.m. on the day before. During the course of the investigation, investigators determined that Gates was struck by a 2014 Jeep Cherokee Trail Hawk that was found in Cabot and had DNA matching Connors, police said. Conners surrendered at Pulaski County District court on Feb. 17 and entered an innocent plea. Also on Monday, Benton police announced that Jerrica Speed, 28, of Hot Springs had been arrested in connection with a Jan. 15 hit-and-run that killed 13-year-old Zarious Evans of Benton. Evans was found dead in the 19000 block of South Service Road just before 7 a.m. on Jan. 15, after police received a call about an unresponsive boy in the area. A Jan. 17 police news release identified Speed as the driver of the black Nissan Pathfinder involved in the crash and said she had contacted authorities about it. Speed faces charges of leaving the scene of an accident involving death or serious injury, negligent homicide and obstructing governmental operations, police said. Authorities said three minors are also facing curfew violations and other misdemeanor charges related to the hit-and-run. The identity of the minors and information about the other charges were not immediately released. Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         SPRINGDALE --A Springdale Police officer shot a man in the head Wednesday morning after he pointed a gun at him, according to a release from Capt. Jeff Taylor. The department received a call around 12:50 a.m., Wednesday saying a female had been shot on Eicher Avenue in Springdale. When officers arrived, they found Argentina Agee, 31, shot in the arm, according to the news release. Officers were told that the suspect was in a blue Chevy Tahoe, which they found nearby in the driveway of 1115 Eicher Avenue, the release states. Eicher Avenue is about two blocks from Murphy Park. Officers found a 17-year-old male lying under a blanket in the back seat. An officer opened the rear passenger door and told the suspect to show his hands, according to the the release. The man then began to sit up and as he did, he pointed a pistol at the officer who then fired, hitting the suspect in the head, according to the news release. The identity of the suspect is not being released at this time other than he is a 17-year-old male, the release states. Officers began providing first aid to the male and Agee until paramedics arrived on the scene. Both the male and Agee were taken to local hospitals for their injuries, according to the release. The investigation of use of deadly force by the officer as well as the shooting of the female victim is being handled by the Washington County Sheriff's Office. The officer has been placed on paid administrative leave, which is standard protocol pending the Washington County Sheriff's investigation as well as an internal investigation, the release states. This is the second time in the last two weeks an officer has fired his weapon at a suspect near Murphy Park. Police received a call about 6 p.m. Feb. 15 from a woman saying Ethan Brasel, 20, would not get out of her car in the western parking lot of Murphy Park on South Pleasant Street, according to a department news release. The caller reported Brasel had a pistol in his front waistband and there was another gun in the car, police said. Officers said they found Brasel sitting in the front passenger seat of a white car. Officers ordered Brasel out of the car and asked if he had any weapons, the release says. Brasel said he didn't have a weapon, but officers could see a rifle in the front passenger seat of the vehicle, the release says. Brasel ran when one of the officers began to pat him down in a search for weapons, police said. An officer yelled Brasel had a gun as police chased him west from the park, police said. An officer ordered Brasel to drop the gun, according to the release. An officer then fired his gun at Brasel, but didn't hit him, the release said.

        Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed an executive order Tuesday requiring state officials and a newly formed coalition to draft policies addressing faults in Arkansas' foster care system. The order tasks state department heads and Every Child Arkansas -- a network of non-profits, faith-based organizations and private placement agencies -- with finding ways to recruit more foster care parents, connect families with social services and create preventive strategies to keep children out of foster care, Sanders said during a news conference. "This executive order will have a major direct impact on the foster care system here in Arkansas," she said. "It's just the first of many steps we're planning to take." By cutting processing times and speeding foster family licensing, Sanders said she expects the initiative to place children in homes in less than two months. The program also aims to increase the transparency of the foster care system and deputize a foster advocate to help foster families in each county, Sanders said. Roughly 4,100 children were in foster care in Arkansas as of January, according to the state Department of Human Services. Lawmakers, advocates and foster families crowded the governor's conference room to watch Sanders and other officials affiliated with Every Child Arkansas deliver remarks. Before Sanders signed her order, Dr. Phil Goad, chair of the executive leadership council for Every Child Arkansas, announced the official launch of the foster care network's website. "It will raise awareness of the need for foster care and adoptive families in our state," he said. "This magnificent new online resource will be telling encouraging stories of success and provide opportunities for Arkansans across the state to volunteer and learn more about foster care." The Every Child Arkansas network aims to ensure Arkansas has "more than enough" foster families, adoptive families and support for biological families, Goad said. The coalition includes organizations such as CASA for Children, CarePortal, Children's Homes Inc., Project Zero and others, according to the network's website. "It is our goal and belief that Arkansas can and will be the first state in the United States to reach every child, to be more than enough for every child and every family in every county in our state," he said. Jerome Strickland, executive director of The Contingent Arkansas, announced the partnership was kicking off a marketing campaign dubbed Show Up Arkansas. "If you want to show up and serve, all you have to do is go to www.everychildarkansas.org," said Strickland, pointing to the network's new website. Mischa Martin, deputy director for the Department of Human Services, said the launch of Every Child Arkansas would help communities work with the department's Division of Children and Family Services and partner organizations. "Now our communities can see and work with us and connect," she said. "Great things are going to happen when we come together." The executive order requires the establishment of the Arkansas Strategic Plan for Foster Care Placement. The plan involves a working group composed of Every Child Arkansas and the secretaries of the state Department of Human Services, Department of Public Safety and Department of Education. Among other strategies, the plan will aim to support in-home parenting, deliver mental health and substance abuse treatment services to foster children and biological and foster families, facilitate coordinated monitoring of child safety and recruit foster families committed to supporting biological families and promoting reunification. After developing the strategic plan, the working group will incorporate "trauma-informed training" into existing training systems within the respective departments for child-welfare workers, educators and public safety and law enforcement officers. The coalition also will recommend to the governor any specific actions needed to facilitate the order, including more executive or legislative measures no later than June 30. Sanders' executive order charges the secretary of the Department of Human Services or a designee of the secretary with streamlining the adoption process from state foster care and the placement of children in foster care with relatives. State officials are tasked with submitting a report on "strategies to interrupt generational cycles of abuse and neglect that impact children aging out of foster care," presenting recommendations on measures to avoid homelessness, human trafficking and incarceration for children aging out of foster care, and comparing outcomes for assisting children aging out of foster care in Arkansas with national and regional outcomes. The director of the Division of Children and Family Services is required under the order to meet quarterly with foster care stakeholders "to collaborate on efforts to better serve children and families receiving services through" the division. The meetings will continue through at least the end of the 2025 calendar year, and officials will have to provide annual reports on the meetings to the governor. The Division of Children and Family Services at the Arkansas Department of Human Services is also tasked with creating or coordinating a single-source website location for data related to foster care in the state. The site will include county-level foster care data, an annual report card and operational report for the division, the name and contact information of at least one foster and adoption advocate in each county not employed by the state, and other information suggested by the director of the division, according to the order.

        BENTONVILLE -- Mayor Stephanie Orman gave her State of the City address Tuesday night, looking back at city highlights that happened last year. Her address came at the end of a 17-item City Council meeting. "As I reflect on 2022, I am grateful for our city employees and all they do, for this council and their wisdom and support, for those who choose to serve with their talents and time on a city board or commission, and for a community that works to volunteer and serve our neighbors each and every day," she said. "Whether you are a long-time resident or you have just moved here, the city of Bentonville welcomes you and encourages you to take an active role with us as we strive each day to make Bentonville the best place in the United States for all to live, work and play." A "can-do" attitude defines the city and continues to deliver results and allows officials to honestly face challenges by listening, learning and collaborating for better solutions, Orman said. Bentonville is a top destination for regional, national and worldwide travelers, she said. "From our vibrant downtown square and what we affectionately refer to as the 'Best Trailhead in America' to numerous historical areas, world-class museums, expansive recreational facilities and programs and diverse culinary options, many are visiting our city, and many of those visitors are determining Bentonville is a great place to call home." The declaration of Bentonville as the "The Mountain Biking Capital of the World" continues to attract biking enthusiasts across the country and the world to enjoy award-winning trails, Orman said. In 2022, Bentonville was announced as the new home of the U.S. National Mountain Bike Team. The city continues to see announcements of investment in new housing and businesses driven by an inspiring entrepreneurial spirit, economic resilience, a focus on high quality of life and healthy lifestyles, public safety initiatives, innovative and responsible planning and design, inclusive parks, recreation and library programming, infrastructure investments, and a growing arts, outdoor recreation and cultural scene, she said. In April 2021, residents passed a bond extension designed to help the city keep up with growth, infrastructure, public safety and efficiency improvements without a tax increase. "A major focus of 2022 for staff was to get proposed bond projects designed, bid and underway for completion under the first bond drawdown," Orman said. Senior staff led 611 full-time employees and 147 part-time employees in 2022. "I am pleased to tell you tonight Bentonville enjoyed another great year for sales tax with our per penny amount eclipsing $21 million for the first time," she said. "Bentonville's 2022 sales tax receipts increased by 11% compared to 2021 collections." Transportation Department 2022 capital projects included the completion of the Northwest Third/Southwest Eighth Street bike lane improvements and the South Main Street improvement, which included new widened sidewalks, drainage and street lighting. Water Tower Road phase 1, which included a roundabout and the connection of Southeast Eighth Street from Water Tower Road to Interstate 49, was also completed. The Eighth Street project that extends from Southwest I Street to Southeast J Street is under construction and will provide additional vehicle travel lanes for east/west traffic and the addition of sidewalks and a two-way cycle track that extends the length of the project. The section from Southwest I to South Walton Boulevard was completed and reopened to traffic flow. In stage 1 of the bond program, there are 15 street projects and 13 drainage projects in design phase, Orman said. The Street Department completed 13 miles of pavement preservation, used 210 tons of asphalt for pothole repair and completed 12 miles of pavement crack sealing, Orman said. In 2022, an estimated 4.5 million people, including 2.5 million trail users, visited a city public park. The parks team produced more than 140 recreation programs and special events attended by more than 596,000 people and producing more than $4.3 million in revenue, Orman said. In June, the city opened the Orchards Park Dog Park and destination play area, fulfilling a major need for the park since it opened 10 years ago, Orman said. In December, the city added its 22nd park by accepting a donation from the Bogle Family and formally adding Bob and Marilyn Bogle Park, Orman said. During 2022, the city Emergency Communications Center handled approximately 112,955 calls. About 45,674 calls were Police Department calls for service. Another 7,015 calls were related to fire and EMS calls for service, Orman said. Two large projects approved by the 2021 bond extension were finalized in 2022. The Police Department completed the selection of a public safety radio system and entered into a contract with RACOM/Harris to complete a new radio system. The P25 system will allow full interoperability with surrounding agencies, Orman said. In December, the department began construction of a training facility that will include a live-fire training range, K9 training course and growth for future expansion of training facilities. Completion is set for April. Bentonville continues to rank in the top five safest cities in Arkansas to live in, Orman said. The Fire Department received 12,067 fire/EMS calls for service, up 5% over 2021. There was a 12.4% increase in fires (170), a 33% increase in rescue calls for service (144) and 10.5% increase in automatic alarm calls (739). The Fire Training Division conducted 58,654 hours of training, a 20% increase over 2021, Orman said. The Building and Fire Division saw a 2% increase in building permits (4,806), a 2% decrease in permit fees ($2.3 million) and a 31% decrease in permit value. The office conducted 1,053 housing unit inspections, a 43% increase. They conducted 12,112 building inspections on new construction, a 7% increase, and did 3,071 fire inspections on existing commercial buildings, a 60% increase. In 2022, they conducted 18 fire investigations, down 10% from 2021, according to the mayor's address. In 2022, the public library recorded 763,427 circulations of its collections, including checkouts of physical materials and downloads of digital books. This is the library's highest circulation ever, Orman said. Bentonville planning processed 384 projects, an increase of 5% from property line adjustments, lot splits, rezonings, conditional uses, variances and waivers. Development items made up 58% of all projects and zoning requests made up 42%, Orman said. In 2022, the Planning Commission reviewed 79 rezoning requests, up two from the previous year, and 38 conditional uses, up 65%, Orman said. City planning reviewed 74 large-scale developments, up 23% from 2021, she said. Appointed City Council members and city staff worked with a housing affordability work group throughout 2022 to study and make recommendations to improve the supply of and access to affordable, attainable housing. The Housing Affordability Work Group presented its report to City Council on Jan. 24. Staff is evaluating, prioritizing and assessing the feasibility of the recommendations. "As we look to 2023, we will commemorate the 150th birthday of Bentonville and our incorporation as a city," Orman said. "We look forward to celebrating this milestone with the community as we reflect on who we are, where we came from, what we have accomplished as a community and how we continue to improve upon our future together."  Other action The Bentonville City Council on Tuesday approved: Establishing a short-term rental work group that identifies membership, administrative structure and deliverable timeline. A bid waiver to Downtown Bentonville Inc. and authorizing an agreement for services for 2023. Accepting a $261,000 grant from the Walton Family Foundation for pickleball courts at Creekside Park. The city applying for Federal Carbon Reduction Program funds to aid in construction of the Southwest Bentonville Trail from Morning Star Road to Vendor Boulevard. A $3.5 million bid by Crossland Heavy Contractors Inc. for construction of drainage improvements for Little Osage Creek tributary two. The contract is being paid for with 2021 bond funds.

        HIGHFILL -- Northwest Arkansas National Airport officials say passenger numbers are on track to reach prepandemic levels. The preliminary passenger numbers coming from the federal Transportation Security Administration checkpoint at the airport are trending upward of prepandemic levels, according to Aaron Burkes, airport CEO. If the trend continues, the airport could break its annual record of 922,553 passengers set in 2019. Airport officials use 2019 as a measuring stick because the covid-19 pandemic decimated travel beginning in early 2020 and the airline industry is still working to get back to prepandemic levels. In 2020, passengers at the airport declined 61% to 360,133. "Potentially at least, based on January and February's through-put numbers, we are on track to potentially beat 2019's numbers," Burkes said. "At least that's how this year is starting so far." Through-put is the number of people, passengers and airline personnel, who pass through the TSA checkpoint. Burkes noted with more flyers, parking demand will likely also go up. To that end, airport officials said they'll probably start having discussions about where they can put more parking and whether it's time to look at designing a second parking deck or move rental car businesses to another location. A groundbreaking for the terminal improvement project is set for March 14 after the airport board's meeting. Jim Krall, chairman of the board, said he's excited to see the long-awaited project begin. "Everybody will be able to see that construction take place," said Krall, who represents Siloam Springs on the board. A proposed skybridge connecting the parking garage and terminal was dropped from the project in December. The rest of the renovation will go ahead as planned at an estimated cost of $34 million. There will be more elevators, escalators and stairwells and new baggage-handling equipment. The TSA and police areas will be renovated. There also will be a host of architectural upgrades, including new paint, terrazzo floors, lighting and sound baffles; a new information desk and a canopy along the front of the terminal covering the drop-off area; and new flight information displays. Construction is estimated be completed in about two years.  Print Headline: Passenger numbers taking off at airport Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         ROGERS -- The Police Department will soon buy a virtual reality simulator to train its officers. The City Council on Tuesday unanimously approved the purchase of an Apex virtual reality training simulator from GOVRED Technology Inc. of Las Vegas. Police Chief Jonathan Best said the department is the first in the region to use the Apex simulator, which will allow officers to do much more training at police headquarters. Training technology supplier GOVRED sells virtual reality systems for use by both police officers and soldiers, according to the company's website. The system for police departments, called Apex Officer, includes training in firearms, crisis intervention, deescalation, active shooter threats, traffic stops and a variety of other scenarios. The Apex system creates a more immersive environment than many other training simulators, according to Best. "Traditional simulator training for law enforcement uses a screen or a series of screens to create the training environment," he said. "This vendor is unique in that they use goggles to create a 3D virtual environment for the trainer." When using the technology, trainees wear a virtual reality headset, which covers their eyes. The headset includes a screen intended to provide the appearance of an immersive environment. Trainees can use modified firearms and stun guns in the sessions. The department has heard "rave reviews" from other law enforcement agencies using the technology, according to Best. The Apex simulator comes with 35,000 different scenarios, which are all able to be tweaked by the trainer, he said. "In one scenario, the guy can reach into a car and pull out a gun. In the next one, the training operator can make him pull out a cellphone or a wallet," he said. The department is allowed to use up to $73,913 for the purchase, which will include two headsets and accompanying equipment, he said. Funds for the equipment were accounted for in the city's 2023 budget, which was approved by the council in November. The Apex Officer technology is currently being used by at least one law enforcement agency or department in every U.S. state, Apex announced in January. The Pulaski County Sheriff's Office became the first agency in Arkansas to use the system last July. In other news, the council also approved a proposed adaptation of an empty building at 1639 N. Arkansas St. to a 12-unit multifamily rental development. Council members unanimously approved rezoning the property north of downtown from residential office zoning to residential multifamily rental zoning.

        LITTLE ROCK -- An Arkansas Senate committee on Tuesday advanced a bill that would require the secretary of state to permit and arrange the placement on the state Capitol grounds of a suitable monument commemorating "unborn children aborted" during the era of the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court ruling under Roe v. Wade. In a voice vote with Sen. Clarke Tucker, D-Little Rock, dissenting, the Senate committee sent Senate Bill 307 by Sen. Kim Hammer, R-Benton, to the 35-member Senate. If enacted, the measure would be known as the "Monument to Unborn Children Display Act." On June 24, then-Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge signed a certificate implementing a 2019 law that bans abortions in Arkansas except to save the life of the mother in a medical emergency, just hours after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the landmark 1973 ruling that legalized abortion across the nation. Under Senate Bill 307, the Capitol Arts and Grounds Commission would oversee the selection of the artist and design of the monument "with input from pro-life groups in Arkansas." The secretary of state would have final approval of the selection of the artist and design of the monument selected by the commission before any construction is started under SB307. Upon approval of the artist and design, the secretary of state would be required to arrange for the construction, placement and dedication of the monument on the state Capitol grounds by private entities at no expense to the state of Arkansas. The bill would establish on the books of the state treasurer, the state auditor and the state's chief fiscal officer a trust fund to consist of gifts, grants and donations from individuals and organizations and other funds as may be provided by law. The trust fund would be used exclusively for erecting and maintaining a suitable monument on the state Capitol grounds commemorating "unborn children aborted" during the Roe v. Wade era. Tucker said he hopes everyone can agree it is by and large an intensely personal decision for a person choosing to get an abortion for varying reasons. "Some women, who made that decision, may regret it or ... may appreciate having a monument on the state Capitol," he said. "I am not saying it is universal, but I would have to believe that there are scores of women out there who felt like they had to make a decision either for their own health or for whatever reason it might be, and for there to be a public monument, which is a visual reminder, would just be adding pain to the process." Hammer said he wants to be respectful of women who have made decisions to have abortions, including some women who found themselves in unfortunate situations. "I want the monument to be tasteful, respectful [and] honoring of the babies that were not privileged to see life on Earth, although I believe life begins at conception," he said. "I would want it to be sensitive to the fact that if somebody walks by that monument it respects the multitude of emotions that are represented in that monument," Hammer said. "But at the same token, we do have monuments on the Capitol grounds that celebrate life, as in the Little Rock Nine, that recognize lives that were given in the line of duty both in the military and as public servants. We have monuments for a wide range of things on the Capitol grounds." He said it is important to have visual reminders of a painful chapter in the state's history. During the period from 1973 until 2022, at least 236,243 elective abortions were performed in Arkansas, according to Hammer's Senate Bill 307. "I think the number alone is significant enough that it deserves recognition, and we deserve to be reminded of it," Hammer said. But Tucker said "we are just memorializing the consequence of a conscious choice that these women made." He said people in Arkansas have strong opinions on multiple sides about abortion, but the other memorials on the state Capitol largely have broad support among the state's general population. Hammer countered that "I think the majority has spoken on the [abortion] issue. "The Ten Commandment monument was a very controversial monument that was placed on the Capitol, but the majority spoke because I think they saw the value in having a reminder," he said. Afterward, Hammer said he hopes the proposed monument could be erected onto the state Capitol grounds within the next two years. He said he has been approached by monument companies interested in donating the monument.  Print Headline: Memorial bill advances to full Senate Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        BENTONVILLE — A Siloam Springs teacher is free on $75,000 bond after his arrest last week on a sexual assault charge involving a student. Prosecutors have not filed a formal charge against Ethan Wells, 29, who was listed as a choir teacher at Siloam Springs Middle School. The investigation started after the mother of one of Wells former students reported to police a sexual relationship between her son and Wells, according to a probable cause affidavit. Siloam Springs Superintendent Jody Wiggins said in a statement the district received information alleging inappropriate activity by a secondary level teacher during the 2021-22 school year. He said the district notified local law enforcement and filed a report with the Department of Human Services hotline. Wells was placed on administrative leave. Immediate termination of his contract has been recommended, Wiggins said. The mother said her son was 18 years old at the time, but he had not graduated from high school, according to the affidavit. The former student reported he met Wells in the eighth grade when Wells was his choir teacher, according to the affidavit. The student said he and Wells started texting each other and became close friends, the affidavit states. He said Wells became his mentor, but his senior year he started having feelings for Wells, according to the affidavit. The student said after he turned 18 years old, he told Wells in April 2022 how he felt about him, the affidavit states. Wells told the student he also had feelings for him, according to the affidavit. The student said he and Wells engaged in a sex act twice at school, according to the affidavit. He said their relationship lasted from April 11 to June 23, and, after graduation, he realized what occurred between Wells and himself was wrong, according to the affidavit. Wells arraignment is scheduled for 8 a.m. April 3 in Benton County Circuit Judge Robin Greens courtroom. District Judge Jeff Conner ordered Wells not to have any contact with his former student. Wells is earning $53,213 in his teaching position this school year, according to district documents. He was named the Arkansas Choral Directors Association Region 6 Junior High Distinguished Director in 2021.  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         WASHINGTON -- A 29-state coalition led by the state of Arkansas prevailed in a lawsuit against the state of Delaware in a 9-0 U.S. Supreme Court opinion over unclaimed MoneyGram funds when the high court issued an opinion Tuesday saying those funds should be refunded to the states where the transfers originated. According to a news release from Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin, the state led a 2016 lawsuit against the state of Delaware over the issue of whether unclaimed and abandoned funds related to MoneyGram official checks should be released to the plaintiff states where the checks were purchased or the state of Delaware, where MoneyGram -- which is headquartered in Dallas -- is incorporated. According to Forbes Magazine, more than 1.6 million businesses from around the world -- including Walmart, Amazon, American Express, Disney, Google and Tesla -- are incorporated in Delaware because of the state's tax code, privacy laws and legal system. In 2016, Griffin's office said, Arkansas brought an original jurisdiction action in the Supreme Court seeking more than $250 million in unclaimed funds from uncashed MoneyGram official check products that it claimed were wrongfully handed over to the state of Delaware. The case, Arkansas et al. v. Delaware, centered on which state is entitled to take custody of funds payable on unclaimed official checks sold by MoneyGram, a money transfer services company that operates in all 50 states and internationally. Under the Federal Disposition Act, Griffin said, proceeds on unclaimed money orders, traveler's checks and similar items must be turned over to the state where an item was purchased. But, Griffin said, since 2005, MoneyGram has turned those funds over to Delaware, as its state of incorporation. On Tuesday, the high court agreed that those funds are governed by the Federal Disposition Act and that MoneyGram should have turned those funds over to Arkansas and its coalition partners, not Delaware. In Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson's first opinion as a Supreme Court justice, Jackson said that MoneyGram checks are similar enough to money orders to be covered under the Federal Disposition Act, which means the hundreds of millions of dollars in unclaimed funds currently claimed by Delaware will instead go to the states in which the MoneyGram purchases originated. Under the Federal Disposition Act, states are "entitled to the proceeds" of unclaimed money orders and traveler checks that originated in their state. "We hold that the FDA covers the instruments in question and thus that they should general escheat to the State of purchase," Jackson wrote in her opinion. "When a financial product operates like a money order ... it is sufficiently 'similar' to a money order to fall presumptively within the FDA." Other states in the coalition are Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming. The coalition is led by Arkansas, with a leadership group from California, Texas and Wisconsin. Pennsylvania is allied with Arkansas's coalition and did not argue separately, but deferred to Arkansas. "This is an important win for Arkansas and our coalition of states," Griffin said in a press release Tuesday. "For the past decade, Delaware has claimed millions of dollars that rightfully belong to us, and that money will now go where it belongs."

The election will be May 9. The annual fee is $150, and the request is for an increase to $200 yearly. Steve Long, who lives in the district, encouraged the Quorum Court to approve the ordinance to allow the members to vote on the measure. "Let the voters of the fire district take control over fees," he said. Long said voting against the special election would deny the will of the people in the process. Sheila Gallagher, a member of the district, said she was divided on the issue but questioned whether there is an emergency requiring the special election. She wanted the board to hire a part-time chief who could determine staffing issues before having a special election. David Cauldwell, a fire board member, said the board is seeking to hire a part-time chief who may be able to hire more part-time staff. Cauldwell said the staffing will continue to be sparse for the remainder of the year. He said more coverage will be increased next year if the fee increase passes in the election. Larry Smith, another board member, encouraged the Quorum Court to approve the ordinance for the special election to give the members an opportunity to vote. Mary Gardener, who lives in the district, said communication had improved with the fire board, but she did not think the communication had improved enough to support the special election. She asked the justices of the peace to vote against the ordinance. Justice of the Peace Joel Jones moved for the Quorum Court to approve the ordinance. He said he knows the board has changed and is looking for a new chief. He said the new board had not yet met or provided the Quorum Court with any additional information. Jones asked audience members who live in the district for a show of hands whether they were in favor of or opposed to the ordinance. More people favoring the vote raised their hands. Justice of the Peace Ken Farmer said the Quorum Court would be adding another year of uncertainty to the fire board and district if it did not approve the ordinance. The justices of the peace voted 13-1 to approve the special election. Justice of the Peace Joseph Bollinger was the lone vote against the ordinance. The Quorum Court voted to suspended the rules and held the three readings at Tuesday's meeting. The vote was the same on the next two readings. The ordinance needed three readings for the special election to be placed on the ballot. Bollinger said he voted against the ordinance because he was concerned that members of the fire district had not been given enough time to be made aware of the election and tax increase. The board attempted to increase the fees last year but ended up withdrawing the measure. The board withdrew a petition in August to start a process to raise the rates. Under the plan that was withdrawn, residents would have had to pay based on the appraised value of their homes. There was heavy opposition to the planned rate increases.

         Arkansas and 14 of its cities will be allocated portions of roughly $44 million in annual grants for affordable housing, community development, and homeless assistance, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced Monday. The state's funding is part of $5.6 billion HUD is distributing to 1,200 communities across the country. The money is targeted through five separate programs, and not every city receiving grants will get money from every program. Arkansas is receiving funds through only four of the programs. "Viable communities must promote integrated approaches to develop decent housing, suitable living environments, and expand economic opportunities to the most vulnerable," said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge in a press release. "These funds allow communities to address their unique needs by prioritizing what matters most to their residents and letting them own their investments in community development through these important federal resources." Arkansas is slated for $17.8 million via the Community Development Block Grants, an annual grant for states, cities and counties for providing decent housing and a suitable living environment, and by expanding economic opportunities, principally for low- and moderate-income people. The 14 cities -- West Memphis, Texarkana, Springdale, Rogers, Pine Bluff, North Little Rock, Little Rock, Jonesboro, Jacksonville, Hot Springs, Fort Smith, Fayetteville, Conway and Bentonville -- will all receive funds from the grant, with Little Rock the only one receiving more than a million dollars at $1.4 million. According to HUD, in 2022 the program helped more than 60,000 families through housing activities, 46,000 individuals through job creation or retention, 83,500 people experiencing homelessness through improvements to homeless facilities, more than 5.3 million people through public services, and over 39 million people through public improvements. Arkansas is getting $10.5 million from the HOME Investment Partnerships Program. HOME is a tool used by states and local governments to produce affordable rental and owner-occupied housing for low-income families. HUD reported that in 2022 the program helped create more than 15,000 units of housing and nearly 17,000 households were assisted with tenant-based rental assistance through the HOME program. Pine Bluff ($268,888), North Little Rock ($396,150), Little Rock ($844,274), Fayetteville ($512,642) and Fort Smith ($462,538) are the only Arkansas cities also receiving HOME funding. Arkansas is receiving $2.3 million in Emergency Solutions Grants. This funding is dedicated for homeless shelters, assisting in the operation of local shelters and funds related to social service and homeless prevention programs. Each year, the program connects more than 350,000 people to emergency shelters as they transition to permanent housing. Arkansas ($1.4 million) and Little Rock ($1.03 million) will be allocated funds for Housing Opportunities for Persons With HIV/AIDS (HOPWA). The program provides stable and permanent housing assistance and supportive services to low-income people living with HIV. More than 100,000 households receive HOPWA housing assistance and/or supportive services annually.

         WASHINGTON -- In arguments lasting more than three hours Tuesday in two separate cases, conservative justices holding the Supreme Court's majority questioned the Biden administration's authority to broadly cancel, wipe away or reduce federal student loans held by millions of Americans because of the covid-19 emergency. Loan payments that have been on hold since the start of the coronavirus pandemic three years ago are supposed to resume no later than this summer. Without the loan relief promised by the Biden plan, the administration's top Supreme Court lawyer said, "delinquencies and defaults will surge."   The plan has so far been blocked by Republican-appointed judges on lower courts. President Joe Biden's only hope for being allowed to move forward appeared to be the slim possibility, based on the arguments, that the court would find that Republican-led states and individuals challenging the plan lacked the legal right to sue. That would allow the court to dismiss the lawsuits at a threshold stage, without ruling on the basic idea of the loan forgiveness program that appeared to trouble the justices on the court's right side. Chief Justice John Roberts was among the justices who grilled Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar and suggested that the administration had exceeded its authority. Three times, Roberts said the program would cost $500 billion, pointing to its wide impact and hefty expense as reasons the administration should have gotten explicit approval from Congress. The administration says the program is grounded in a 2003 law that was enacted in response to the military conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan and has estimated its cost at $400 billion over 30 years. "If you're talking about this in the abstract, I think most casual observers would say if you're going to give up that much ... money, if you're going to affect the obligations of that many Americans on a subject that's of great controversy, they would think that's something for Congress to act on," Roberts said.  Justice Brett Kavanaugh said it "seems problematic" for the administration to use an "old law," the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act of 2003, usually called the HEROES Act, to unilaterally implement a debt relief program that Congress had declined to adopt. The HEROES Act gives the secretary of education the power to "waive or modify any statutory or regulatory provision" to protect borrowers affected by "a war or other military operation or national emergency." "Some of the biggest mistakes in the court's history were deferring to assertions of executive emergency power," Kavanaugh said. "Some of the finest moments in the court's history were pushing back against presidential assertions of emergency power." At another point, though, Kavanaugh suggested the program might be on firmer legal ground than other pandemic-related programs that were ended by the court's conservative majority, including an eviction moratorium and a requirement for vaccines or frequent testing in large workplaces. Those earlier programs halted by the court were billed largely as public health measures intended to slow the spread of covid-19. The loan forgiveness plan, by contrast, is aimed at countering the economic effects of the pandemic. Prelogar said its plan fit comfortably within the statutory language, which she said had authorized the secretary of education to act. "The whole point of this statute, its central mission and function, is to ensure that in the face of a national emergency that is causing financial harm to borrowers, the secretary can do something," she said. Prelogar and some of the liberal justices sought several times to turn the arguments back to the people who would benefit from the program. The administration says that 26 million people have applied to have up to $20,000 in federal student loans forgiven under the plan. "The states ask this court to deny this vital relief to millions of Americans," she said. Justice Sonia Sotomayor said her fellow justices will be making a mistake if they take for themselves, instead of leaving it to education experts, "the right to decide how much aid to give" people who will struggle if the program is struck down. "Their financial situation will be even worse because once you default, the hardship on you is exponentially greater. You can't get credit. You're going to pay higher prices for things," Sotomayor said. But Roberts pointed to evident favoritism. "Didn't half the borrowers say they would not have any trouble paying their loans without regard to the forgiveness program?" Roberts asked. Prelogar said it would be difficult to segregate the two groups and that the pause in loan repayments applied to all borrowers. Roberts offered a hypothetical example of a person who passes up college to start a lawn service with borrowed money. "Nobody's telling the person who is trying to set up the lawn service business that he doesn't have to pay his loan," Roberts said. "We like to usually leave situations of that sort, when you're talking about spending the government's money, which is the taxpayers' money, to the people in charge of the money, which is Congress." Sotomayor responded that "everybody suffered in the pandemic, but different people got different benefits because they qualified under different programs." Justice Elena Kagan also addressed the chief justice's concern. "Congress passed a statute that dealt with loan repayment for colleges, and it didn't pass a statute that dealt with loan repayment for lawn businesses," she said. "And so Congress made a choice, and that may have been the right choice or it may have been the wrong choice, but that's Congress' choice." SIDES DRAWN In separate cases, six Republican-led states -- Nebraska, Missouri, Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas and South Carolina -- and two individuals are lined up against the plan as a violation of Biden's executive authority. Democratic-led states and liberal interest groups are backing the administration in urging the court to allow the plan to take effect. The justices' questions mirrored the partisan political divide over the issue, with conservatives arguing that noncollege workers should not be penalized and liberals arguing for the break for the college educated. Speaking on the eve of the arguments, Biden said, "I'm confident the legal authority to carry that plan is there." The president, who once doubted his own authority to broadly cancel student debt, first announced the program in August. Legal challenges quickly followed. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona proposed a plan that would affect more than 40 million borrowers, about half of whom would see their balances wiped clean. It would eliminate up to $10,000 of student debt for borrowers earning up to $125,000 annually, or up to $250,000 for married couples. Those who received Pell Grants, a form of financial aid for low- and middle-income students, are eligible for an additional $10,000 in forgiveness. The HEROES Act was primarily intended to keep service members from being hurt financially while they fought in wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Nebraska and other states that sued say the 20 million borrowers who would have their entire loans erased would get a "windfall" leaving them better off than before the pandemic. "This is the creation of a brand new program, far beyond what Congress intended," Nebraska Solicitor General James Campbell said in court Tuesday. The national emergency is expected to end May 11, but the administration says the economic consequences will persist, despite historically low unemployment and other signs of economic strength. In addition to the debate over the authority to forgive student debt, the court is confronting whether the states and two individuals whose challenge also is before the justices have the legal right, or standing, to sue. Parties generally have to show that they would suffer financial harm in order to have standing in cases such as this. A federal judge initially found that the states would not be harmed and dismissed their lawsuit before an appellate panel said the case could proceed. Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined the three liberal justices in repeatedly questioning Nebraska's Campbell on that issue. But it would take at least one other conservative vote to form a majority. "Why didn't the state just make MOHELA [the Missouri Higher Education Loan Authority] come then?" Barrett asked. Campbell, Nebraska's solicitor general, who represented the states, said it was "a question of state politics." Prelogar conceded that the loan authority would have standing had it chosen to sue in its own name. But it did not, she said, and Missouri was not entitled to sue on its behalf. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said the authority was independent of the state. TEXAS CASE The second case, Department of Education v. Brown, was brought by the two borrowers, Myra Brown and Alexander Taylor, and it also raised questions about standing. Of the two individuals who sued in Texas, Brown is ineligible for relief under the plan because her loans are held by commercial entities rather than the government, while Taylor is eligible for $10,000 rather than $20,000 because he did not receive a Pell Grant. The challenges by Brown and Taylor would not benefit them, but instead would ensure that no one gets relief from the loan forgiveness program, Prelogar said. A trial court ruled that they had standing to sue because they had been deprived of the opportunity to urge the administration to expand the plan to provide greater debt relief. "Talk about ways in which courts can interfere with the processes of government through two individuals in one state who don't like the program can seek and obtain a universal relief barring it for anybody anywhere," Justice Neil Gorsuch said. If the Supreme Court rules that at least one plaintiff in one of the cases has standing, it will address whether the debt forgiveness plan is lawful. Among those in the courtroom Tuesday was Kayla Smith, a recent graduate of the University of Georgia, who camped out near the court the night before in order to get a seat. Biden's plan would lift a burden for her mother, who borrowed more than $20,000 in federal student loans to help Smith attend college. "It just seems kind of messed up that college is the expectation, higher education is the expectation, but then at the same time, people's lives are being ruined," said Smith, 22, of Atlanta. The cases are Biden v. Nebraska and U.S. Department of Education v. Brown. A decision is expected by late June.

        The Central Arkansas Library Systems galleries and bookstore located in downtown Little Rock will close on May 31 to accommodate other services in the lead-up to the closure of the Main Library for remodeling, officials said Tuesday. Work to remodel the Main Library could begin in September, said Lance Ivy, the library systems director of facilities and operations, during a news conference held inside Concordia Hall of the Bobby L. Roberts Library of Arkansas History & Art. At the news conference, which was billed as a “media day,” Ivy and other library officials provided updates on the future renovation, new initiatives and coming events. Ivy put the timeline for the Main Library construction at 14-16 months, depending on how things go. The Main Library, located at 100 S. Rock St., opened in September 1997 — the building was originally constructed as a warehouse in 1920 — but it has not experienced a major overhaul since, according to the library system. Th e f ive - s to r y, 156,000-square-foot buildings new features after the remodeling might include an atrium-style entrance, better outdoor space in the back and a dedicated space for homeless patrons, according to the library system. Although at the moment the Main Librarys lower level is open to the public only during periodic used-book sales, it will become “almost entirely available” to patrons post-renovation, a handout from the library system on Tuesday said. The building will be closed to the public during renovation. To keep some services available to individuals in the downtown area in the meantime, library officials plan to repurpose various spaces in the Roberts Library in a temporary setup they have dubbed “Mini Main.” Other services and programs are anticipated to operate out of the nearby Cox Building. The Roberts Library is expected to house spaces for reading or studying, a computer lab, areas for children and teens as well as popular books and magazines, Ivy said. Some have criticized the decision to close the Galleries & Bookstore at Library Square, and opponents of the move recently voiced their concerns at a Jan. 26 library system board meeting. Library officials have yet to lay out in detail how the space set to become “Mini Main” inside the Roberts Library might be used after the actual Main Library reopens in 2025. The handout said that following the renovation, “the downstairs space of the Roberts Library will be repurposed but will continue to showcase local art and rotating exhibitions.” Last year, library officials selected a team of architects to oversee the remodeling work at the Main Library. On Feb. 8, a library committee chose CDI Contractors to carry out the construction work, although a measure authorizing an agreement with the firm has yet to come before the board. Staff who work in the Main Library will have to relocate during the transition. Some will go to 7773 Sloane Drive in Little Rock, a building just southeast of Bill and Hillary Clinton National Airport/ Adams Field where library officials have leased 32,000 square feet of space. The Sloane Drive building also is expected to host used-book sales while the Main Library is closed. The final two used-book sales downtown are scheduled for March 9-11 and July 13-15. The Main Library remodeling is the result of a referendum last May in which Little Rock voters authorized the extension of a capital-improvement millage at the lower rate of 1.3 mills — a reduction of 0.5 mill — as well as the refinancing of library bonds. The refinancing was meant to generate some $22 million to use on improvements, including the Main Library overhaul. Ivy on Tuesday noted that the library systems new bookmobile — another expenditure bankrolled by proceeds from the bond refinancing — is expected to arrive this fall.

        Pulaski County Judge Barry Hyde gave his State of the County address on Tuesday at the North Little Rock Innovation Hub, marking the first time the space has hosted the event. The event also featured a performance from Argenta Community Theater for the first time, with over 150 in attendance. Hyde, the countys chief executive, thanked the many elected officials present before giving his address. He mentioned that Pulaski County is a regional leader in economic development, innovation and accessible community services “by being fiscally conservative and goal-oriented.” In his speech, Hyde pointed out the Little Rock Port as a “bedrock” for expanding its ability to attract employers and positively impact the economy. It currently provides jobs for over 10,000 individuals in central Arkansas counties. Since Hyde took office in 2015, the Pulaski County Brownfields program, which supports redevelopment of vacant and contaminated properties, has provided more than $1.6 million in funding to support 54 redevelopment projects. It has also leveraged approximately $145 million for remediation projects in rural and urban areas and saved 10 historical buildings, thus creating hundreds of construction and permanent jobs. “A vitally important aspect of our growth and progress is based on our commitment to innovation,” Hyde said. “By implementing innovative technology, infrastructure and sustainability programs, Pulaski County has positioned itself for a bright and prosperous future.” By the end of next year, the countys two solar farms will provide over 90% of the countys buildings and ports offices energy. As a result, Hyde said, the county expects to save approximately $250,000 a year in electricity costs. In addition, the energy and efficiency improvements to all county buildings are projected to reduce energy and water consumption by 68% and save taxpayers an additional $446,000 annually. Hyde also mentioned Pulaski County was the first to establish curbside recycling for residents in unincorporated areas. The program has seen approximately 3 million pounds of recycled materials diverted from landfills every year. The countys first Crisis Stabilization Unit was also mentioned, as it has served 1,300 individuals annually, with an average stay of two and a half days. “This translates into 2,756 days of treatment as opposed to incarceration,” Hyde said. The states first Community Village for chronically homeless people at 6900 Green Road on a 150-acre lot in a rural part of southwest Pulaski County will offer a permanent and an affordable option for those seeking housing. Led by Community Services Department Director Frederick Love, the village will provide residents with programs to assist them with physical and emotional needs. For the past eight years, Hyde said the county has doubled its Rental Assistance Program, added a veterans housing component and extended its Emergency Solutions Program to assist the homeless. “Annually, our supportive housing programs help 453 individuals suffering from behavioral disorders, chronic illness and HIV/AIDS,” he said. “Participants receive the comfort of knowing they have a safe place to call home while receiving essential medical and behavioral health services.” Over 700 veterans receive assistance every year by the housing and rental assistance program. The Pulaski County Youth Services department has flourished since its inception by “engaging young citizens and empowering them” with necessary resources, Hyde said. The free ACT Prep Program averages 500 participants a year, and the new Teen Court Model for Restorative Justice is a credited class where students can correct behaviors and develop healthy habits. In 2019, after-school and summer programs were expanded to the Higgins, Oak Grove and McAlmont communities. These programs now serve 200 youth a day, 70% of whom come from single-parent homes and are 80% more likely to need nutritional assistance. To meet the demand, Hyde announced that this summer the county will partner with Lawson Elementary School in the Pulaski County Special School District and Seis Puentes, a nonprofit organization in North Little Rock with programs that help Hispanic people with education, information and resources. A summer workforce preparedness program will also launch at Mills High School in southeast Pulaski County to connect students with local employers. Hyde also reviewed the countys recent allocation of American Rescue Plan Funds for many projects. The county was able to partner with the Arkansas Hunger Relief Alliance to provide the delivery of 140,000 meals to over 11,000 residents last year. The funds also gave way for the county to partner with the Arkansas Regional Innovation Hub to bring STEAM programs to students via the hubs mobile makerspace. Over 2,000 youth have benefited from the mobile makerspaces various workshops. Hyde addressed the countys close monitoring of traffic flow around Two Rivers Park, the Big Dam Bridge and the River Trail System to ensure safety of visitors. A new traffic circle was installed at Two Rivers Park trailhead and at North Landing at the foot of the Big Dam Bridge. One of the most exciting developments, Hyde said, is the all-inclusive playground at Two Rivers Park. Once complete, it will be the largest all-inclusive playground in the state. “Concurrently, the county is in the process of updating all of our county-owned playgrounds to meet ADA compliance,” he added. “Soon, there will be 10 inclusive playgrounds in the unincorporated areas of the county.” Hyde, a former state legislator, concluded by saying that “While retrograde policies and divisiveness have afflicted many within our state, Pulaski County will not stand for it. “We will continue to innovate and move forward, never backwards,” he said. “We will work together to ensure that Pulaski County is a community where everyone feels welcome and respected. Together we have achieved much, and together we can achieve more.” County Attorney Adam Fogleman said the county is forward-looking and working on efforts now for the solar array and the community village, which will have lasting impacts. “The judge did a great job over the last eight years,” he said. “Hes put together a very good team. And with that team, weve been able to make pretty big strides in a lot of areas. Its hard to really encapsulate all the business of a county into a relatively short speech. But I think he hit the high points on the major strides that have been taken in the last eight years and certainly in the last four.”  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        The Little Rock School District is continuing to seek an attorney generals opinion on the legality of holding private school board meetings when reacting to a cyber- or ransomware attack on a districts electronic information systems. Little Rock Superintendent Jermall Wright sent a lengthy letter in January to the attorney generals office asking how to appropriately balance a school boards obligations for disclosure under state law with the risk of harm to students and employees that public discussion of a cyberattack could pose. Eric Walker, staff attorney for the 21,000-student Little Rock district that experienced a cyberattack late last year, said this week that the matter is pending. “We did submit a request,” Walker said. “The response was that the Superintendent was not the proper person that could make the request. The response indicated that we should ask a member of the Arkansas General Assembly to submit the request on behalf of LRSD. Sen. Clarke Tucker agreed to submit it for us. Ive not heard back yet.” In his letter to the states lawyers, Wright described in some detail what happened in the Little Rock district cyberattack and said the district “is working diligently to be better protected the next time threat actors attempt a ransomware attack.” “In order for LRSD and other Arkansas school districts to be better prepared, legally, the LRSD requests the opinion of the Attorney General concerning the steps a school board may take to minimize the risk to employees and patrons, to deal effectively with the threat actors, and to restore normal operations as quickly as possible.” Wright specifically asked how a board can strike an appropriate balance between the Arkansas Freedom of Information Act — that requires prior public notice of a meeting and for most meetings to be open to the public — and the threat of harm posed by public discussion on a cyberattack. “Can a school board meet privately to discuss how best to respond to a threat actor when the alternative is to risk the disclosure by the threat actors of the personal information of school district patrons and employees?” he asked. Wright noted that the district was advised by the data security consultants that public disclosure of information related to the attack would greatly increase the risk of the attackers releasing the personal information and hindering normal operations for the school system. Regarding what happened in the Little Rock district, Wright wrote that; “The attackers (threat actors) obtained access to files which contained information about LRSD employees and patrons, including dates of birth, social security numbers, personal addresses, medical information, and personal banking information. “The threat actors also obtained student records, including FERPA-protected information,” he continued. “The release of this information would have put those individuals at risk of having their personal information compromised.” Wright also said the operations of the district were jeopardized. “The cyber attack adversely impacted LRSDs ability to educate its students and maintain its finances because LRSD was forced to disconnect from eSchool and eFinance” which are statewide school data-reporting systems. “This meant that teachers could not input grades or attendance, and parents were not notified by the automatic call system when their children were absent or tardy,” he said. Additionally, the district was delayed in ordering supplies, he said. Wright first told all district employees and the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette on Dec. 1 that the district was a victim of a data network breach, and that the district had employed external computer forensics experts to determine the scope of the problem. The cyberattack — first detected Nov. 11 — was also reported to the FBI. “Although the investigation is still ongoing, our forensic partners have determined that some data may have been taken from our network,” Wright said in that early December message. The School Board in a 6-3 vote at a public meeting on Dec. 5 authorized Wright to enter into a settlement of at least $250,000 to end, as favorably as possible for the district, the cyberattack on the data networks. The School Board had met earlier, Nov. 21, in a session for which no legally required public notice was given. District leaders relied on state laws that exempted disclosure of security plans as a reason for the private session, although the laws did not authorize private school board meetings on the topic. Greg Adams, president of the School Board at the time, said a majority of the board felt it was imperative to hold the meeting in private, because of the specific discussions on the districts networks, concerns about the actions of the cyberattackers and the potential for others to attack the school system. Adams said at the time that he was “keenly aware” that the private meeting “eroded public trust.” “Moving forward, as we complete our investigation into what occurred in this incident and make sure our systems and networks are as secure as they can be, we will provide information to you about what happened, what we did, and what we are doing.”  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.
