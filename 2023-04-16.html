         Officials at the Arkansas Department of Human Services don't know whether 50,000, 150,000 or 200,000 Arkansans will lose Medicaid coverage during the next six months, the department's Chief of Staff Mark White told the House Revenue and Taxation Committee earlier this month. That's because Arkansas and other states are returning to normal eligibility rules for Medicaid for the first time in three years as President Joe Biden ends the federal public health emergency. Beneficiaries, and those whose coverage was extended because of special rules during the covid-19 pandemic, must go through a renewal process to determine whether they remain qualified for the program, department spokesman Gavin Lesnick said. The state Department of Human Services "is working now to redetermine people's eligibility, and send renewal letters to those we need more information on," he said. "Those who respond with information that confirms their eligibility will remain covered by Medicaid." In the federal Families First Coronavirus Response Act of March 2020, states were provided an increase of 6.2 percentage points in federal matching funds in certain Medicaid programs if states agreed to provide continuous eligibility through the end of the month in which the public health emergency ends for anyone enrolled as of March 18, 2020, or after, according to the Department of Human Services. The enhanced rate dropped to 5%, starting April 1, and will be phased out gradually by the end of this year. For example, the federal government is currently covering 76.31%, including the enhanced rate of 5%, of the cost of the traditional Medicaid program with the state covering the other 23.69% through June 30. The continuous coverage requirement meant no Arkansans could be removed from the Medicaid rolls for a change in income or eligibility until the federal public health emergency ends, according to the state Department of Human Services. Cases have been closed only if individuals moved out of state, died, are incarcerated or requested their coverage end. The state's number of Medicaid beneficiaries totaled 1.14 million Feb. 1, up from about 920,000 in March 2020, according to state Department of Human Services records. As of Feb. 1, the state's Medicaid beneficiaries included 343,321 in the state's Medicaid expansion program called ARHOME, 322,646 adults in other Medicaid programs, and 478,672 children, according to the department. ARHOME stands for the Arkansas Health and Opportunity for Me program. In December, the federal Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 granted states the authority to begin the process of re-determining the eligibility for Medicaid beneficiaries kept on the Medicaid rolls because of the continuous coverage requirement, starting April 1, and to reinstate routine eligibility operations, according to the the Department of Human Services. "Arkansas is moving swiftly to unwind the continuous enrollment condition to protect taxpayers and to restore the integrity of the Arkansas Medicaid program," the department said in Arkansas' comprehensive plan to unwind Medicaid continuous enrollment dated Feb. 1. Within 180 days of the expiration of restrictions on the department's ability to unenroll individuals, such as those imposed by the federal Families First Coronavirus Response Act, Act 780 of 2021 requires the Department of Human Services to complete and act on eligibility re-evaluations for all cases that have not had a re-evaluation within the past 12 months. Sen. Scott Flippo, R-Mountain Home, sponsored Act 780 of 2021. He said Thursday he expects "tens of thousands" of Medicaid beneficiaries to be removed from the Medicaid rolls because they don't meet eligibility requirements. The state Department of Human Services described unwinding the continuous enrollment condition as one of the largest and most complex efforts for state Medicaid programs since the implementation of the federal Affordable Care Act. State Department of Human Services Secretary Kristi Putnam said in a recent interview that "there have been a lot of proactive things put in place that weren't there before. "Even with the proactive measures, if there is somebody in an unreachable place," these people are likely to learn they lost Medicaid coverage when they seek services, she said. As of March 23, the department had identified 423,110 Medicaid beneficiaries whose coverage was extended because of the special rules during the public health emergency, Lesnick said. Those beneficiaries' eligibility will be redetermined as part of the renewal process. Beneficiaries were extended during the emergency even if they had an income that exceeded eligibility limits, did not respond to a request for information, had a level of care of medical change that made them no longer eligible, or have aged out of eligibility, according to the department. Under normal eligibility rules, they can lose coverage for those reasons. "They are getting a couple of notices that tell them that, 'Hey, you are going to be terminated if you don't provide this information,' " said Amy Webb, director of the state's Medicaid Control Center. Among other things, the department also is using paid media and social media and meetings with Medicaid providers, nonprofits and advocacy groups to help get Medicaid beneficiaries to update their information with the program, said state Medicaid Director Janet Mann. According to Lesnick, these 423,110 beneficiaries in the extended coverage population include: 131,030 in the state's Medicaid expansion program currently known as ARHOME. 101,214 in the ARKIDS A program. 81,311 parent-caretaker relatives. 45,179 in Medicare Savings Programs. 30,902 newborns. 5,284 in the ARKIDS B program. 3,595 in nursing facilities. 2,008 in TEFRA, which is the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act, a Medicaid program that can help families with children younger than 19 who have a disability and receive care in their homes rather than in an institution, according to the Department of Human Service's website. 2,008 in the ARChoices program, a Medicaid program that includes home and community-based services for adults ages 21 through 64 with a physical disability and seniors age, according to the Department of Human services' website. 772 in the Developmental Disability Services waiver program. Based on a national estimate, the state Department of Human Services estimates between 15% and 30% of the extended Medicaid population will be disenrolled during the unwinding, department officials said. IMPACT OF INCREASED MINIMUM WAGE "It's important to note here that right before and during the pandemic, Arkansas' minimum wage increased three times -- to $9.25 in 2019 to $10 in 2020 and $11 in 2021 -- and would have resulted in a portion of the beneficiaries becoming income ineligible for Medicaid programs," the department wrote in its plan. Mann said the earliest that Medicaid beneficiaries in the extended coverage population could lose coverage will be sometime this month. If Medicaid beneficiaries are determined to be ineligible, their information will be transmitted electronically to the marketplace to try to find them insurance coverage, she said. Fifteen percent of 423,110 beneficiaries in the extended population as of March 23 would be 63,466 beneficiaries in Arkansas, and 30% of the 423,110 beneficiaries in the extended population would be 126,933 beneficiaries in Arkansas. It is important to stress this is only an estimate based on the national figures and not a projection, Lesnick said. "Right now, we have no idea what is going to happen to that extended population because we have already seen some move into regular Medicaid," Mann said, noting she is anxious to see whether that 15% to 30% national estimate pans out in Arkansas. Senate Public Health, Welfare and Labor Committee Chairwoman Missy Irvin, R-Mountain View, said Wednesday "I really have no idea" on how many Arkansans will lose Medicaid coverage. "This redetermination is one of the reasons we wanted to wait on any Medicaid policy changes," Irvin said in a text message to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. "It's important to adjust according to the recipients and their needs and focus intentionally on improving health outcomes." Trevor Townsend, public benefits subject area manager for the Center for Arkansas Legal Services, said Medicaid plays a vital role in providing essential health care services to individuals and families who cannot afford it otherwise. "The end of the Medicaid Continuous Enrollment Condition means that hundreds of thousands of Arkansans will be without health insurance or have to find an alternate source on their own, and many of our clients are not in an economic position to do so," he said in a written statement. The state has an obligation to handle the unwinding process appropriately, from properly notifying enrollees to having enough staff with the skills to handle each case adequately, Townsend said. "This will be a massive undertaking; therefore, it is legally essential for the State to provide adequate notice to Medicaid beneficiaries of any intended adverse action it intends to take," he said. "Previous litigation on Medicaid has made it clear that these due process rights are fundamental and must be specifically followed. Every person has the right to due process, which means if Arkansans have been denied Medicaid due to this change, they have a right to challenge the denial in a fair hearing. Our staff is here to immediately help Arkansans if they receive a redetermination or denial letter through our dedicated helpline ..." Department of Human Services officials said the department has about 800 employed eligibility staff throughout the state and about 280 contract employees to help assist with the expected surge of help sought by Medicaid beneficiaries. In its comprehensive plan to unwind Medicaid continuous coverage, the department said states will face challenges, particularly related to workload and staffing, but Arkansas is positioned to address workload and staffing challenges. That's because the state has continued to process renewals and conduct re-determinations of eligibility throughout the continuous enrollment period while other states put that work on hold, and has increased its eligibility workforce through contractor support and by the filling of vacant positions to help address a backlog of casework in advance of the unwinding period, according the department. In addition, all Medicaid and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program cases also are in one eligibility system for the first time in a decade, and the department is an umbrella human service agency that allows Medicaid to communicate across divisions to reach populations by working both with program and eligibility staff, according to the department. A concern across the nation is that beneficiaries, especially more vulnerable populations such as those who are aged, disabled or with developmental and intellectual disabilities, will lose coverage during the unwinding because states were not given updated contact information and cannot reach them. The state is taking steps to mitigate that concern, according to the department. "The unwinding is a large-scale effort that involves resources from across this agency and affects hundreds of thousands of Arkansans," Putnam said in a written statement. "We have been planning for over a year and we are committed to getting this right, but we also understand that it will be difficult and there will be mistakes. We will closely monitor every aspect of this process, and we will rigorously address any problems as they occur." The enhanced federal matching funds for the state's Medicaid program will end at the end of this year, but they've allowed the state's Medicaid trust fund to build up reserves of more than $600 million, White told the House Revenue and Taxation Committee earlier this month. Lesnick said Thursday the balance of the state's Medicaid trust fund was $662 million at the end of March. White said the state's general revenue allocation for the Medicaid program is flat in fiscal 2024 that begins July 1 because the department will tap funds out of the Medicaid trust fund instead and it's projected the Medicaid trust fund could be at $200 million or less at the end of the fiscal 2024-2025 biennium. That will depend on how many Medicaid beneficiaries remain on the Medicaid rolls, he said. In fiscal 2023 that ends June 30, the Medicaid program's forecasted budget is $9.7 billion with the federal government forecast to pay $7.87 billion of that and the state forecast to pay $1.89 billion, according to Lesnick. In fiscal 2024 that begins July 1, the Medicaid program's forecasted budget is $9.6 billion with the federal government forecast to pay $7.36 billion of that and the state forecast to pay $2.28 billion, he said. In fiscal 2025 that begins July 1, 2024, the program's forecasted budget is $10.1 billion with the federal government forecast to pay $7.71 billion of that and the state forecast to pay $2.39 billion, he said.

         It's almost time to see the art. Four exhibits will greet visitors at the new Arkansas Museum of Fine Arts in Little Rock's MacArthur Park Historic District when it finally reopens to the public on Saturday after almost four years of renovations and expansion. "Together" is a wide-ranging show featuring 31 works by 30 U.S. and international artists. "Chakaia Booker: Intentional Risks" focuses on a two-dimensional aspect of the New York City-based sculptor's work. "Sun Xun: Tears of Chiwen" showcases the Beijing artist's animation, and "Drawn to Paper" is made up of pieces from the museum's permanent collection. The exhibits will help usher in a new era for the museum, formerly known as the Arkansas Arts Center. It's been a minute since art lovers could see works at the museum's MacArthur Park location. The space has been closed since summer 2019 and has undergone a major transformation. The expansion project dates back to 2015, when Little Rock voters approved a bond paid for by hotel taxes to fund about $31.3 million of the museum's renovation. As of September of last year, a private fundraising campaign had raised $150.4 million toward a goal of $155 million for the new 133,000-square-foot building. These funds "will support the new museum and ... provide transition and opening support, while also strengthening the endowment, yielding support for operations, exhibitions, acquisitions, and education and outreach programming in the new museum," according to arkmfa.org. 'TOGETHER' Taking pride of place among the new exhibits is the ambitious "Together." Brian Lang, chief curator and Windgate Foundation curator of contemporary craft, said the exhibit's exploration of togetherness alludes not just to the reopening of the museum, but also society coming back together after the restrictions of the pandemic. "We felt very strongly that, as the inaugural exhibition, it set the tone for what we want to do in the future. As we came back, post-construction, post-covid, we circled back to this theme of together." The show is loosely organized into sections reflecting on friends, family, community, nature and the world, said Lang, who worked on the exhibit with fellow curators Catherine Walworth and Theresa Bembnister. Walworth, the museum's Jackye and Curtis Finch Jr. curator of drawings, said the exhibit includes sculpture, painting, prints, video, textile, installations and more, with works spanning from representational to abstract. "The range of media is so unexpected," she said. "I think that togetherness comes through on so many different levels. There is a nice balance of all kinds of materials, and the way they all work together is so playful and dynamic. There is so much to explore." There is also an element of joy, Lang added. "We were unequivocal in wanting this to be celebratory and colorful. The initial attractiveness of a number of these works draws you in, and then you look more closely and you realize the message the artist is trying to convey." LOCAL CONNECTIONS Among the artists with work included in "Together" are Ryan RedCornof Oklahoma, whose larger-than-life photograph shows Plains Cree mother and daughter Chantelle Keshaye Pahtayken and Shay Pahtayken; Oliver Lee Jackson of St. Louis, whose collaged "Triptych (3.20.15, 5.21.15, 6.8.15)," is on loan from the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.; and Elias Sime of Ethiopia, whose "Tightrope" is made from reclaimed electrical wires and computer keys. Two artists, printmaker LaToya M. Hobbs and photographer Jess T. Dugan, have Little Rock connections. Hobbs grew up in the capital city and graduated from the University of Arkansas Little Rock with a degree in painting. Her 8-by-12-foot woodblock print, "Carving Out Time, Scene 1: Morning," is a segment from an even larger work that depicts a day in her life as a mother, wife and artist. "They specifically requested that image because I think they felt like it represents a lot of the themes and values that they were trying to express with the exhibit," said Hobbs, who is a professor at the Maryland Institute College of Art in Baltimore. Having artwork in the museum's inaugural show is one of those full-circle moments for the 39-year-old Hobbs, whose woodcuts were shown in two editions of the Delta Exhibition, an annual exhibit that began in 1958 at the arts center. "Thinking about the three different instances of work that I've shown there, I think it shows the development of my practice," Hobbs said. "I'm definitely excited about that." The reopening of the museum "is a really significant thing for Arkansas," she adds. "It will be a destination for arts and art culture. I feel honored to be asked to participate in the opening exhibition." On June 1, Hobbs will be part of the museum's inaugural Artist Talk with Dario Robleto and Alison Elizabeth Taylor, both of whose work is included in "Together." Dugan was born in Biloxi, Miss., and lived in Little Rock before moving to Massachusetts at age 13. Before then, Dugan recalls spending plenty of time at the Arkansas Arts Center and performing in its children's theater. "It's really a touching place for me. I took theater classes when I was there and I went to the summer theater camp for several years in a row." Curators chose Dugan's photograph of a North Little Rock couple, "Hank, 76, and Samm, 67, North Little Rock, AR, 2015," to be included in "Together;" the image is among several in the exhibit that was acquired by the museum for its collection. The photograph was part of "To Survive on This Shore: Photographs and Interviews with Transgender and Gender Nonconforming Older Adults," a project Dugan worked on with social worker and researcher Vanessa Fabbre. "A driving force in my work is the belief in the importance of representation," said the 36-year-old photographer, who lives in St. Louis. "I'm passionate about creating representation of LGBTQ+ people and communities, and it's especially meaningful to me to have a piece like this in an institution in a place like Little Rock. I'm really excited and I'm grateful to the curators for including it and to the subjects for being part of it." PRINTS, ANIMATION, WORKS ON PAPER Booker is known for her large-scale sculptures made from recycled tires and stainless steel. "Intentional Risks" will include one of those pieces, but the exhibit concentrates on her print work. "In her tire sculptures, she's doing a lot of layering," said Lang, who has been with the museum since 2012 and curated "Intentional Risks." "You get that same approach in her prints. ... She uses very thin paper that she is cutting up and tearing and layering on a support and then running them through a press. They have a lot of depth." Focusing on Booker's prints is a nod to the printing program in the museum's Windgate Art School, Lang said. "We wanted to showcase an artist that is exploring prints in a unique way." "Tears of Chiwen" is a fast-paced animated piece that is more than nine minutes long and made of drawings and prints by Sun. Its title comes from the mythical creature often seen as a decorative element on the edges of roofs in east Asia. Bembnister, who has been with the museum since 2020, curated the exhibit. "Sun Xun is a very accomplished draftsman," she said. "He does all sorts of drawing and printmaking. The animation has several different styles throughout its length. The video we are showing is from 2017 and it's the first time it's been shown in a museum in the United States." "Tears of Chiwen" is presented in the museum's New Media Gallery, which will concentrate on digital art -- video, animation, projected work and more, Bembnister said. "It's important that we are doing that because not only are artists working in that way, but it's the way we live. We spend so much time on our digital devices and consume so much media that way, it's important that we incorporate new technology and new media into the way that we look at and exhibit art." One of the great strengths of the museum is its collection of works on paper, bolstered by the late Townsend Wolfe, who became the arts center's director and chief curator in 1968 and was there for more than three decades. "Drawn to Paper" delves into the museum's cache of American and European drawings and features almost 60 works by the likes of Paul Signac, John Marin, Edward Hopper, Georgia O'Keeffe, Elizabeth Catlett and more. The show will also include the work of Inez H. Whitfield, whose watercolors documented the wildflowers of Arkansas. "It's a stamp of our identity," Walworth said of the exhibit. With the opening just a few days away, the curators are ready f0r the public to come see the art and the new space. "It's been a long journey," Lang said. "It's been challenging, curatorially, to identify the work that we wanted to debut and do it in a thoughtful, aesthetically pleasing way. In the end, I think guests will be surprised. It's a collection and building that will make everyone in Arkansas proud."

         The North Little Rock School Board's unanimous approval to remake Seventh Street Elementary is setting off activity on hiring staff, assembling a student body and creating a community advisory panel. Last week, all job openings were listed online and each has several applicants already, Superintendent Greg Pilewski said. One of the biggest decisions that will happen first, Pilewski added, is "finding our new leader, which will be the next principal." With the reconfiguration to grades prekindergarten through eighth grade by 2026, all licensed staff now have to reapply for their jobs at the start of the 2023-2024 school year to allow for Seventh Street to have the best possible team of teachers, Pilewski said. The school will also hire a literacy and math coach for small-group intervention. The reconfiguration will start by adding a sixth grade for the 2024-2025 school year, a seventh grade the following year and an eighth grade the year after that. For the 2023-2024 school year, all licensed employees prekindergarten through fifth grade will be given a $10,000 stipend paid in three installments; in the 2024-2025 school year, all licensed employees prekindergarten through sixth grade will be given a $4,000 stipend paid in two installments; and in the 2025-2026 school year, all licensed employees prekindergarten through seventh grade will be given a $3,000 stipend paid in two installments. An extended-day and extended-year model will be implemented to allow for more intensive support in identified areas for students. Theme-based learning will continue in both of these models and embed industry partners into the programming. The estimated budget for the next school year -- with staffing, reconfiguration stipends, professional development, curriculum and instructional materials, field experiences and the extended day and year programs -- amounts to $702,000. Maurice Taylor, a North Little Rock City Council member representing Ward 2, said he grew up in the Seventh Street neighborhood and knows all the "ins and outs." "I really think that [the reconfiguration] is a great opportunity for that school to grow," he said. "I think that the opportunity for everyone to be rehired is a plus, as well as adding some additional staffing and then, of course, we'll do a broad search for leadership, make sure we got the right principal in place, so I'm really looking forward to how that's gonna turn out." A community advisory board is starting to form from the district community, Pilewski said. The completed board will feature parents, school staff, non-profit leaders, faith-based leaders, local government, student representatives and a school innovation coach. "We're excited about the response -- we've had people reach out to us say, 'wow, this is really cool, I really want to be a part of it,'" Pilewski said. A master schedule for all of the grade levels is included in the plan, with Wednesdays being dedicated to intensive support groups, presentations and possible field trips. The students would also have an early release on Wednesdays to allow teachers to have more time for lesson planning, approximately 40 more hours per year, Pilewski said. "We're planning all the professional development that we have outlined in the plan, project-based learning, which will be a foundation for that," Pilewski said. "But it also then gives us -- with the community advisory board -- to plan successfully, to open the sixth grade in the following year. The community advisory board, their big first thing they're going to chew on is the theme." The theme options for the school include "ASTEAMED," or Animal Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Math, Environmental Science and Design Thinking, Animal and Veterinary Science, or Technology Integration and Ingenuity. Each theme would focus on a concept per grade level with the option to incorporate more content as students move up in grade level. No other school in the state has a theme of animal and veterinary science, so Seventh Street would be the first. Pilewski said the goal is to have a theme picked by early summer to open the school in the fall with proper marketing. "I love theme-based learning," said Tracy Steele, a member of the school board for Zone 2, who attended Seventh Street Elementary as a child. "I also really appreciate applied learning, actually having kids do it and learn it at the same time ... We have to do more for our children at Seventh Street." Taylor agreed, adding that "a lot of thought went into the dynamics of what's going to happen with the school." Students living in the community and currently enrolled in the school will have first priority for attendance. If seats are still available after that, students in or out of the school district can enroll through a lottery system, according to the plan. Originally, the reconfiguration plan included a name change for Seventh Street Elementary. But Pilewski amended the plan to not include the name change at this time. In the first proposal, the name "6-57" was brought forward to honor the North Little Rock Six, the six Black students who tried to desegregate the high school for the first time on Sept. 9, 1957. Seventh Street families in a survey rejected this name for their school, but 50% voted in favor to change the school's name to honor the North Little Rock Six, and 61% of families districtwide voted in favor to change the name to honor the North Little Rock Six. The Community Advisory Board will vote on a new name in the future. "The takeaway is we got a conversation started and there's support for it," Pilewski said. Exposure is a large focus for the school, he added, saying the district is excited about launching the bigger vision and being "future-ready." "I'm also excited [about] the project-based learning, the engagement that kids are going to get, in relevant, real, hands-on, inquiry-based learning -- and that, to me, is what it's all about. That's the paradigm shift, helping a child learn reading, writing, speaking, listening, math. "Your core subjects, through a themed approach, makes the learning relevant and more meaningful."

         FAYETTEVILLE -- Arkansas relied on a familiar formula Saturday night at Baum-Walker Stadium. Right-hander Will McEntire gave the sixth-ranked Razorbacks a six-inning start before right-hander Gage Wood pitched three scoreless innings in relief. The duo led Arkansas to a 6-3 victory over 12th-ranked Tennessee 6-3 to win their series. The Razorbacks will go for a sweep today beginning at 2 p.m. It was the fourth time in SEC play -- and the second consecutive game against the Volunteers -- that Arkansas paired a six-inning start with three innings of relief. McEntire, who earned his first win since March 18, allowed 2 runs, 6 hits and 3 walks, struck out 5 and threw 55 of 86 pitches for strikes. Wood allowed 1 hit and struck out 6 during his 60-pitch outing. The Vols' only run against him came with two outs in the ninth inning when Tears walked and scored on three wild pitches. "Will, he fought and gave us some innings," Arkansas Coach Dave Van Horn said. "The next thing you know, he gave us six innings. Once we got to the point where we needed nine outs, we thought we'd go with Gage because he's been throwing the ball pretty good. He's pretty confident and he did it for us." Arkansas (28-7, 10-4 SEC) won its third consecutive series and took a one-game lead over LSU atop the SEC West standings near the midway point of league play. Tennessee (23-12, 5-9), last season's SEC champion and this year's favorite to win the SEC East, dropped its third consecutive series. The Vols have won the series finale the past two weeks against LSU and Florida to avoid sweeps. The Razorbacks handed Tennessee junior right-hander Chase Dollander (4-4) his fourth loss. Dollander, who is projected to be the second pitcher selected in this year's MLB Draft, allowed 3 runs (2 earned) in 4 1/3 innings. Dollander allowed 2 hits and 2 walks, and struck out 8 during his 93-pitch start. "He's got electric stuff, but we got his pitch count up and that was the goal," Van Horn said. "It started when the very first hitter of the game [Tavian] Josenberger saw 11 pitches ... and got us off to a good start." Josenberger was on base when Jace Bohrofen hit a 447-foot home run to right-center field on a 96-mph fastball from Dollander in the bottom of the first inning to give Arkansas a 2-1 lead. It was the fourth consecutive game with a home run for Bohrofen, who has homered 10 times this season and is batting .413. "Our coaching staff did a great job of just really preparing us for what we were going to see today," Bohrofen said. "Seeing [top pitching prospect Paul Skenes of LSU] three weeks ago definitely helped us prepare to hit a high fastball like that. He did a really good job out there tonight." The Razorbacks added a run against Dollander in the fifth inning when designated hitter Ben McLaughlin singled to score Caleb Cali, who reached on a two-base error by Tennessee left fielder Jared Dickey. Dollander exited the game trailing 3-1. "I'm still looking forward to that outing where we push the limit on the pitch count with him a little bit, but to me, the starter's job is ... to come out of the game and give us a chance to win," Tennessee Coach Tony Vitello said. "He certainly put us in a position to do that." Arkansas stranded five base runners during the fifth and sixth innings, and Tennessee first baseman Blake Burke homered against McEntire (5-1) to lead off the sixth and pull the Vols within 3-2. Tennessee put the tying run on base in the sixth when pinch hitter Kavares Tears singled with one out, but the inning ended with a double play. Arkansas catcher Parker Rowland threw out Tears after Zane Denton struck out on a 3-2 pitch low in the zone. "Anytime you get a double play ... like that it's a huge momentum shift," McEntire said. "You get the momentum on your side and you take that to the dugout and the offense does its thing." Arkansas scored three runs against Tennessee right-hander Camden Sewell in the seventh inning. John Bolton was hit by a pitch to lead off the inning and scored when Sewell threw an errant pick-off throw to third base. Kendall Diggs and Cali also had two-out RBI hits in the inning to extend the Razorbacks' lead to 6-2. Sewell's throw to third came on a double move from first to third base. With Bohrofen at the plate and Peyton Stovall on first base, Sewell was unsuccessful in four consecutive pick-off attempts to first. "We try something there because when it's not going well you can't just sit still," Vitello said. McEntire settled in after allowing a lead-off home run to Dickey that gave Tennessee a 1-0 lead. It was Dickey's second consecutive lead-off homer, but the Vols have scored only three other runs in two games against the Razorbacks. Tennessee out-hit Arkansas 7-4. Both teams stranded seven base runners. "The first two innings I didn't really have my stuff, and as the game went on I started finding it more and more," McEntire said. "You've just got to battle through those times when you don't have it, and once you find it, it gets a lot easier." The Razorbacks have a chance to sweep a series for the first time since March 17-19 against Auburn. "It feels good, but it's like I told the team, let's not just be all happy about this," Van Horn said of having a 2-0 series lead. "I didn't even mention that we'd won the series because ... we have another game [today] and we need to do everything we can to try to win that thing."

         HOT SPRINGS -- The Garland County jail on Wednesday had 29 inmates with mental health issues who were either waiting to be transferred to the Arkansas State Hospital or to be evaluated, which could take up to a year or longer, Garland County Sheriff Mike McCormick said. "I think that's outrageous and it's a battle we fight every day," McCormick told members of Hot Springs National Park Rotary Club during their weekly luncheon meeting. It's an issue "I'm greatly troubled by," he said. He said there are nine inmates with criminal charges pending who have been deemed not fit to proceed who are waiting for admission to the State Hospital, including one who has been incarcerated for 760 days "waiting for a bed." There are another 20 inmates waiting on their fitness to proceed evaluations, which can take up to a year, he said. He said the state's response is, "'We want your people. We want to get them evaluated. We want to get them treated, but we can't. We have no beds." He said the county has been getting "roughly two beds a year" at the State Hospital. McCormick said some of the inmates affected are jailed on misdemeanor charges. "They're being held long in excess of what they would be held if they just pleaded guilty, but they don't have that option once an evaluation is ordered," he said. The jail is also housing "umpteen state prisoners" who have been convicted and are still waiting for space in the prison, he said. It's "almost like the same system at the state hospital," he said. "When a bed comes open, we ship one to the state hospital or prison and then the process starts all over again." He said law enforcement officers are "repeatedly arresting the same people time and time again," and while they all do a great job, "it's impossible to make progress." Less than 20% of the inmates are charged with misdemeanors, with the majority felony defendants either waiting for trial or waiting to go to prison. "The court system is back-logged and has been for years," McCormick said. "Once again, the reason is we're dealing with the same people, time after time after time. Plea bargains are common. It's a must with the system we have because there's no way everybody will have their day in court. So many, many, many of the cases are plea bargained." He noted this often involves "violent offenses, not just petty stuff." "These people are put back out on the street, and guess what? Prison inmates that are paroled out violate on an almost predictable level," he said. "When they get arrested for a parole violation, guess where they go? To the county jail and they're caught back up in the system." Many of the criminals McCormick has dealt with over his 41 years in law enforcement "have passed away," he said. "If they haven't, we're still dealing with a lot of them and a lot of their family members, which is interesting when you see the third or the fourth come along, and you arrested his grandfather and his father," McCormick said. "It's like a tradition that continues on." He said he is excited about new crime initiatives in the state. "I hope it makes a difference," he said. "It's going to be a lengthy process before it's actually in place and effective. It could easily be five years or 10 years. Who really knows the timeline? So there's hope in the future, but it's rough right now. That's why we're in the situation we're in, that continued revolving door system." McCormick did share some good news with the Rotary members, noting that overall crime in the unincorporated parts of the county is down 38.8% since 2014. "So we are heading in the direction that we need to go," he said. "It's up and down but the trend is definitely heading down." He noted violent crime in that same time period is down 48.6% and property crime is down 36.9%. "Here's something that has not changed that has changed in most parts of the country," he said. "Within our community, there's a tremendous loyalty to the law enforcement people. A lot of people have turned their back on law enforcement, but that's not true in Garland County. That's not true in Hot Springs, and for that, I thank you a lot." McCormick said the sheriff's office is responsible for patrolling 735 miles in the county with 50 commissioned deputies. "In today's world, we're having more and more back-to-back calls all the time which limits us as far as routine patrol and crime prevention, but we do the best that we can," he said. He said deputies work 12-hour shifts, 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. or 6 p.m. to 6 a.m., and "we have a tremendous group of deputies that are very dedicated." He noted the county also has 17 commissioned deputies in the criminal investigation division that "follow up on major crimes and they stay very busy also." The job of a law enforcement officer is tough, he said. "It was tough when I started and it gets tougher every single day, but it is the job that I love and as sheriff of Garland County I do have the best job in Garland County."

         WASHINGTON -- In his opinion blocking a federal regulation protecting bodies of water, U.S. District Judge Daniel Hovland recognized the confusion in recent years surrounding the rule. The "waters of the United States" definition under the Clean Water Act clarifies the waterways and wetlands under federal protection, but as Hovland noted in his decision last Wednesday, there has been "an endless stream of lawsuits and legal challenges" surrounding regulations. States and industry groups challenged a 2015 definition that expanded the waters under federal protection. The Trump administration replaced the regulation with the Navigable Waters Protection Rule narrowing protections, but federal courts rejected those standards. "Suffice it to say the Clean Water Act, and the varied and different definitions of 'waters of the United States,' have created nothing but confusion, uncertainty, unpredictability, and endless litigation throughout this country to date," wrote Hovland, who serves in the district of North Dakota. Hovland's decision added to the debate surrounding the current waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule, which the Biden administration announced last December. Arkansas and 23 other states secured a preliminary injunction blocking the regulation amid an ongoing lawsuit challenging the rule. A federal judge in Texas last month blocked the definition from taking effect in Texas and Idaho. "If you look at the complaints that were filed by the states in this North Dakota case and in the Texas case, they're making the same arguments," said Brigit Rollins, a staff attorney at the nonpartisan National Agricultural Law Center in Fayetteville. "These are arguments that come up a lot in the WOTUS debate. These are not new arguments that the states are bringing up, particularly because of this rule. We see these a lot." The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers announced the latest "waters of the United States" definition last December with nationwide implementation to take effect March 20. Citing confusion surrounding previous rules, officials based the latest definition on the "waters of the United States" rule in effect from 1986 to 2015. The rule additionally incorporates precedent from a 2006 U.S. Supreme Court case regarding actions affecting downstream waters and wetlands connected to a protected waterway. Lawmakers and agricultural organizations were quick to criticize the rule, arguing the definition grants federal agencies excessive regulatory authority. Rollins said another issue evaluated by lawmakers and courts regards navigable waters -- or bodies of water allowing interstate and foreign commerce -- under the Clean Water Act. "How far Congress meant for WOTUS to extend beyond traditional navigable waters is sort of that struggle at the heart of trying to define WOTUS, and we see that in these decisions," she said. "There was kind of this look at this idea that WOTUS, this new rule, includes intrastate waters, and that's something the judges have zeroed in on, saying, 'We think that this reads navigability out of WOTUS by including all intrastate waters that perhaps cannot be used to facilitate interstate commerce or foreign commerce, and would therefore fall outside of that commerce clause authority.'" In his opinion, Hovland stated the rule does not provide landowners with clear definitions of waters affected by the federal definition. He described the agencies' determinations as "unintelligible and provide little guidance to parties impacted by the regulations." Hovland and U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Vincent Brown of Texas expressed concerns about the broadness in determining the waters affected by the "waters of the United States" rule. West Virginia is leading the states' challenge in the North Dakota federal court. Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin called last week's decision a "win for every Arkansas landowner." The EPA said in a statement that officials are reviewing Hovland's decision to determine the best options regarding water protections. "The agencies remain committed to establishing and implementing a durable definition of 'waters of the United States' informed by diverse perspectives," the EPA said. "Our goal is to protect public health, the environment, and downstream communities while supporting economic opportunity, agriculture, and industries that depend on clean water." For states where the recent rule is not in effect, officials will follow the rule and government orders made before the 2015 change. Officials had been using this guidance leading up to the recent "waters of the United States" definition taking effect. The U.S. Congress has already voiced its opposition to the latest rule; the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives passed a congressional resolution nullifying the definition with a handful of Democrats joining Republican colleagues on the votes. President Joe Biden vetoed the legislative action. Republican Reps. Rick Crawford of Jonesboro and Bruce Westerman of Hot Springs sponsored the House version of the resolution. Republican Sens. John Boozman of Rogers and Tom Cotton of Little Rock were sponsors of the Senate version. "Both Presidents Obama and Biden have tried to seize from [the] state and localities, the regulation of ever-smaller wetlands, streams, ponds, and periodic sources of water," Crawford said in a statement. "This radical power grab for federal control would mean higher prices for agriculture products, as well as environmentalist vetoes over private land use, all without making our water cleaner." Westerman, the House Natural Resources Committee chairman, also celebrated Hovland's decision. "Arkansas farmers, small businesses, and landowners can sleep better knowing that they will not be impacted by the flawed WOTUS rule for the time being," he said. Rep. Steve Womack, R-Ark., criticized the Biden administration for the definition, arguing agencies pitch rules while failing to have "any experience or any basis for its legitimacy." "A lot of these are just good ideas that emanate from a very hyper-regulatory organization, and they just test the limits to see how far they can go with this stuff," the Rogers lawmaker told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. "Frankly, when they go too far, it's going to raise the ire of a lot of people that are impacted by it." The American Farm Bureau Association, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, the National Pork Producers Council, and the U.S. Poultry and Egg Association were among the parties that intervened in the North Dakota lawsuit in support of the states. "Particularly, when it concerns farming, there is not a better conservation-minded people than today's American farmer," Womack said. "They live off the land. That's their enterprise. They have to have the land in order to do what they do." Evan Teague, vice president of environmental issues with the Arkansas Farm Bureau, struck a similar message in a statement on the preliminary injunction. "We stand firm in our belief that no one understands and protects the environment better than the farmers and ranchers who rely on water for food production every day," he said. "This is not an issue of regulation vs. non-regulation. It is about who is regulating: Washington bureaucrats or folks closer to home who have a practical understanding of these issues and are directly accountable to the people whom they serve." Hovland's decision coincides with building anticipation regarding how the U.S. Supreme Court may affect water protections in the coming months. Justices heard oral arguments last October regarding an Idaho couple's efforts to build near wetlands that federal officials determined are protected. The Supreme Court is expected to issue a decision by the end of its term this June. Hovland expressed hope the Supreme Court will provide clarity on water protections. "Until then, every state will continue to swim in waters of uncertainty, ambiguity, and chaos," he added. Crawford and Westerman said they want the Supreme Court to issue a ruling addressing the federal government's regulatory authority over waters. Womack noted the Supreme Court's responsibilities involve adjudicating regulatory disputes. "I'm a limited government sort of guy," he said. "I think, sometimes, we ask the federal government to do things for us that don't really need to be done." Rollins has doubts about the Supreme Court resolving the debate surrounding water protections. She mentioned opinions from the 2006 Supreme Court case as an example; by justices mentioning downstream waters and nexuses to protected water bodies, federal agencies had vague guidelines on implementing regulations. "For the foreseeable future, for our lifetime, there's probably not going to be an end to some kind of legal dispute over the best way to regulate water," she said. "That's how government works, that's how people work. We're all trying to figure out what's the best way to do this."

         After almost a century, is Arkansas ready for a new state bird? Two bills were proposed in the last legislative session to change the name of the state bird -- to painted bunting or mallard duck -- but neither of them got off the ground. This time. The mockingbird has been the Arkansas state bird since 1929, when Gov. Harvey Parnell and the 47th General Assembly adopted House Concurrent Resolution Number 22 proclaiming: "The mockingbird is declared and everywhere recognized as the state bird of the State of Arkansas," according to the Encyclopedia of Arkansas. But it's an odd bird, and not unique to Arkansas. The mockingbird is also the state bird of Florida, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas. "The mockingbird can sing for hours on end; unmated males sing at night," according to the Arkansas encyclopedia. "Moreover, these birds can mimic other bird species as well as dogs, sirens and even squeaky gates -- thus their scientific name, Mimus polyglottos, or 'mimic of many tongues.'" And yes, it is against the law to kill a mockingbird. Maybe even a sin. "Shoot all the blue jays you want, if you can hit 'em, but remember it's a sin to kill a mockingbird," Atticus Finch told his son Jem in a book by Harper Lee. WARBLER? If Arkansas is going to change its state bird, the Cornell Lab of Ornithology has a suggestion: the Kentucky warbler. "Despite its name, the Kentucky warbler would be a great choice for Arkansas state bird: a full 14% of the global population breeds in the state," bird experts at Cornell wrote in the spring issue of Living Bird magazine, https://bit.ly/3KZIFVJ. But that could cause a flap. "I'd have a better chance of getting Dumbo as the state bird," said state Rep. Brit McKenzie, R-Rogers, who proposed the mallard in the last legislative session. "I get it: theirs is a very noble and academic pursuit, and that's awesome. It's the Kentucky warbler. That's never gonna happen. That one would be dead on arrival." State Rep. Grant Hodges didn't like the sound of it either. "I think our friend the warbler might be disqualified with that name," said Hodges, a Republican from Centerton. "Maybe if it would consider changing its name to Arkansas warbler?" Hodges said he wants the people of Arkansas to make the state bird decision. He proposed the painted bunting as a placeholder so his House Bill 1842 could go to interim study and give people a couple of years to think about it before the 2025 session of the Legislature. McKenzie filed his House Bill 1849 shortly after Hodges filed his bird bill. But for McKenzie, the mallard isn't a placeholder. "I'm an outdoor enthusiast and a lifelong duck hunter," he said. "This bird does mean a lot to our state, our economy and our culture. People have been waterfowling here for hundreds if not thousands of years for this bird that ends its migration in Arkansas." And the mockingbird? "I'll be as blunt as I can," said McKenzie, "I don't think the mockingbird has generated one red nickel for the state of Arkansas." According to the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, duck hunting has an economic impact of about $70 million a year in Arkansas. That averages out to about $1 million each day duck season is open. The number of mallards in the Delta region of Arkansas hit a four-year high during aerial observations conducted in early January. "Observers estimated 929,248 mallards and more than 1.74 million total ducks on transect lines in east Arkansas," according to the commission's annual midwinter waterfowl survey. "Arkansas is the duck hunting capital of the world," said McKenzie. "I think the case for this is not only financial or cultural. This bird has an identity, and this identity reflects Arkansas." Hodges said he's not a bird expert or bird watcher. A birder asked him to propose the legislation and suggested the painted bunting as the placeholder. "I think this could be a fun, lighthearted conversation that can engage our citizens and bring more interest into the symbols we've chosen to represent the Natural State," said Hodges. "I would love to see Arkansans, especially kids, discover an interest in nature and the outdoors, and maybe even learn something about the legislative process. "If we set out to have fun and learn something, the future of our state could be as bright as a painted bunting's beautiful feathers." Glen Hooks, policy manager for Audubon Delta, said he reached out to the legislators about the bird proposals. He wants to get Hodges and McKenzie to do a "battle of the birds debate." "Having a more Arkansas-centered bird would be a great thing," said Hooks. "We're all for a wild and lively debate on what the proper Arkansas bird is. I think there's a lot of good opportunity there to have some fun but also to do some bird education for the general public." Hooks said hummingbirds are also popular in Arkansas. And tufted titmice. The General Federation of Women's Clubs started a campaign in the 1920s to get states to designate their state birds. Now, all 50 states and the District of Columbia have official birds. But there's a lot of repetition. Three species -- cardinals, mockingbirds and meadowlarks -- represent 18 separate states. According to the Living Bird article, seven states share the northern cardinal, six claim the western meadowlark, and five honor the northern mockingbird. Only 20 states have unique state birds, and there are more than 700 native bird species to choose from. WOODPECKER? What about the ivory-billed woodpecker, which may or may not have been seen in the ancient cypress-tupelo swamp forests of east Arkansas over the past couple of decades? Hooks said that might open a can of worms. "I suspect we will have some people propose that and we'll have fun with it, but I can't push for that one considering that it might not be around anymore," he said. McKenzie was blunt again. "I think a lot of people would think we're tin-foil hat crazy if we tried to put the ivory-billed woodpecker because it's an extinct bird," he said. "I think people would take it as an un-serious pursuit." John W. Fitzpatrick, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Cornell, said he would consider advocating for the pileated woodpecker, "which is almost as majestic" as the ivory-billed woodpecker. It's "very common in the forested areas of Arkansas and a wonderful emblem for Arkansas wilderness," he said. "Plus, surprisingly, no other state has grabbed it yet. What a coup that would be for Arkansas!" Fitzpatrick also likes the mallard idea. "Mallard has a lot going for it, given the outsized importance of duck hunting as an economic driver in Arkansas," he said. "It would also be unique, if a little more boring than a huge woodpecker." Florida also considered grounding the mockingbird. In December, a bill was filed to change the state bird from the mockingbird to the Florida scrub-jay. That bill died in the Environment, Agriculture & Flooding Subcommittee, according to the Florida House of Representatives website. "I strongly favor switching from the ho-hum, occurs-everywhere northern mockingbird to the charismatic, state-endemic Florida scrub-jay," Fitzpatrick was quoted as saying in the Living Bird magazine article. "Seeing this remarkable and world-famous bird is a sublime privilege that is unique to the state."  Print Headline: Next state bird up in the air Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         ROCKIN' RELIEF FUNDRAISER Country singer Justin Moore will headline a show Wednesday to raise money for the Arkansas Hunger Relief Alliance for those affected by the March 31 tornadoes. "Rockin' Relief" is scheduled for 6-10 p.m., at Stickyz Rock 'n' Roll Chicken Shack in the Little Rock River Market. The event came about after radio stations 103.7 The Buzz, where Moore is part of the "Morning Mayhem" show, and The Point 94.1 teamed with Stickyz to help the nonprofit alliance. Scheduled to join Moore on the bill will be Bad Habit, Blane Howard and another act that wasn't announced before we had to turn this in. A $20 minimum donation will be collected at the door, and auction items will also be available for bid "with 100% of the proceeds benefiting hungry Arkansans," according to a news release. Donations can also be made online. Talking about the event last week, Stickyz co-owner Chris King said: "We've been through a lot the last few years, and we like to open our doors to help others in the community. We're really grateful that the folks at Signal Media reached out to us to work on this one. There are a lot of people hurting in a lot of different ways and we're happy to do something community-based and lend some support." ROCKIN' FLEETING GLIMPSE And speaking of Stickyz, the venue makes a brief appearance in "Running With Our Eyes Closed," director Sam Jones' documentary about musician Jason Isbell that debuted April 7 on HBO. At about the 54-minute mark, a baby-faced Isbell, cigarette dangling from his mouth, can be seen with his old band, the Drive-By Truckers, onstage at Stickyz during a show in the early 2000s. King hasn't seen the documentary, but has been inundated with screen shots of the scene and remembers the show. "My main memory is my partner here, Suzon Awbrey, demanding they do an encore of 'The Company I Keep,' from their 'Pizza Deliverance' album. They played it, and it was great." email: sclancy@arkansasonline.com  Print Headline: LR relief event set for Stickyz Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         Though not even built yet, the Anthony Timberlands Center for Design and Materials Innovation is already winning awards. The Timberlands Center, part of the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville's Fay Jones School of Architecture and Design, was recently named the Overall Winner in the AR Future Projects Awards 2023, announced by The Architectural Review, according to the university. Named the Future Project of the Year 2023, the center was the only North American project recognized, and it also won the award for education, a new category this year. "Itself a lesson in timber construction, the building aims to educate new practitioners and inspire the use of wood in construction, consolidating the prominence of Arkansas in the timber industry," according to The Architectural Review. The Timberlands Center, expected to open next fall, is a "tremendously accomplished piece of architecture, and a great building in which to learn about timber technologies," as well as a "fascinating progression of [Grafton Architects'] work away from concrete," the magazine said. The center is being designed by Grafton Architects, a Dublin-based firm whose co-founders won the 2020 Pritzker Prize, considered one of the top prizes -- if not the top -- in the field of architecture, according to the university. It will be located not on the main UA-Fayetteville campus, but, rather, in the university's new Windgate Art and Design District, on Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard in the southern part of the city, and when it opens, it will join -- among other university buildings -- the Studio and Design Center, which opened for classes in January. The Timberlands Center will house the Fay Jones School of Architecture and Design's graduate program in timber and wood. It will also be an epicenter for its multiple timber and wood initiatives, as well as the home for the school's existing design-build program and an expanded digital fabrication laboratory. The latest cost estimate for the center is $33.5 million, a majority of which is covered by private donations, with the rest paid by university funds. The four-story, 44,800-square-foot center will include studios, seminar and conference rooms, faculty offices, a small auditorium and a public exhibition space. Launched in 2002, the AR Future Projects awards are a window into "tomorrow's cities," according to the university. Spanning a dozen categories, they celebrate excellence in unbuilt and incomplete projects, and the potential for positive contribution to communities, neighborhoods and urban landscapes around the world. The Architectural Review is "one of the world's leading architectural journals," and receiving this recognition "positions the university and the state to an international dimension," Peter MacKeith, dean of the Fay Jones School, said in a news release from the university. "Our selection of Grafton Architects and Modus Studio, together with the entire team of consultants, has paid dividends time and again over the last several years, and this award augurs well for the long-term significance of the undertaking." The Timberlands Center will feature a fabrication shop as its largest and most active space, encompassing a large central bay with a metal workshop, seminar room and small digital lab, as well as a dedicated space for a large CNC router, according to the university. A pair of covered outdoor teaching terraces and a 12,000-square-foot pedestrian plaza known as Anthony Way will be located on the western side of the center, an area that will also include a grove of softwood and hardwood trees of the same species that represent those native to the state and commonly used in manufacturing and construction.

         Artist Joan Benefiel is a committee's choice to create the next sculpture at the Clinton Presidential Center to take the place of a sapling from Anne Frank's chestnut tree originally dedicated to her in 2015. Benefiel's unnamed prototype features a large chestnut tree branch "violently broken off" to symbolize the horror of the Holocaust. She said she hopes to have the community vote on a name for the piece. Inscribed on the tree is a quote from Frank: "What is done cannot be undone, but one can prevent it from happening again." Benefiel said she only wished her husband, Jeremy, could have been in Little Rock to celebrate because it was "a partnership and a collaboration for our studio together." Figuration Studio is Benefiel's artwork space in the Brooklyn borough of New York City. "Our family is really excited," she said. "As artists and people in general to get to do a project like this, to get to do something that really means so much, is everything for us as artists. So we're thrilled." Benefiel's husband is Jewish and she said their children are "old enough now" to be "curious" and "wanting to learn" about their heritage. "It's just been such a great opportunity for us to start to have those conversations," she said. "Which is just like a little example of, I think, what it will be for all kinds of folks, all kinds of families and people of all ages, so it's really meaningful." Her sculpture will be enclosed by five 10-foot-tall etched glass panels. One is dedicated to Frank, one contains excerpts from President Bill Clinton's second inaugural address and the rest convey messages from three other violent, discriminatory acts -- the Indian Removal Act of 1830, the Central High crisis and the internment of Japanese Americans in Arkansas during World War II. The Sculpture at the River Market committee, the Clinton Foundation and the Sisterhood of the congregation of B'nai Israel will fund the artist's work and installation at an undecided location at the William J. Clinton Library and Museum. Jane Rogers, president of the committee, said the sculpture should be available at the center for visitors by next May. "An absolutely wonderful piece of public art was chosen to convey the important message from Anne Frank," Rogers said. "It shows an extension and good things happening at the end of a dark period. And I think that speaks to each one of the items, or each one of these situations on the panels that are already there at the Clinton Library."

         100 years ago April 16, 1923 ATLANTA -- "Reno" Hamlin, alleged confidence man, who offered to pay the reward for his own arrest, pleaded guilty in Superior Court here yesterday to a charge of larceny after trust, and was sentenced to serve from one to five years in prison. Hamlin was indicted together with Floyd Woodward and three other alleged bunco men for fleecing Wade Lamar of Aiken, S.C., out of $11,500. He was arrested recently in Muskogee, Okla. Hamlin told the authorities he intended to make full restitution for his acts, and offered to reimburse the state of Georgia for the reward offered for his apprehension. 50 years ago April 16, 1973 BENTONVILLE -- John Wallace Nail, 35, of Wagoner, Okla., one of the three escapees from a Muskogee, Okla., jail, was captured near here late Sunday night, State Police said. Officers said they found Nail hiding in a cave in a rugged mountainous area. He offered no resistance. Nail and Stanley K. Lyles, 21, and Michael Goodman, 22, broke jail and fled with a hostage Saturday. Lyles and Goodman, charged with a California murder, were captured near the Garfield community on U.S. Highway 62 Saturday night following a gun battle with State Police. ... At Fayetteville, the three stole a car after tying up a Fayetteville couple in their home, officers said. ... Officers said state trooper Keith Ferguson of Rogers encountered the three escapees north of Rogers on U.S. Highway 62 and a chase followed which ended at Garfield when bullets from State Police guns flattened the rear tires of the escapees' car. 25 years ago April 16, 1998 BENNINGTON, Vt. -- Two wooden crates that arrived unexpectedly at the Bennington Museum were found to contain seven Grandma Moses paintings that were stolen 14 years ago. Where the artworks have been --and exactly who sent them back and why -- are still a mystery. "It was someone who honestly loved them and wanted to own them and enjoy them," said Deborah Federhen, the museum's curator. "If they wanted to sell them, they would have broken them up and not kept them as a set of seven but tried to dispose of them one by one." The brightly colored New England landscapes were stolen in 1984 from the Rose Valley, Pa., home of Margaret Carr shortly after the woman's death. 10 years ago April 16, 2013 Five buildings and a parking lot in Fort Smith are subject to seizure by the U.S. Marshals Service to satisfy a $30 million judgment against imprisoned evangelist Tony Alamo, a judge ruled Monday. U.S. Magistrate Judge Barry Bryant's ruling came in response to a request by Seth Calagna and Spencer Ondrisek for a "writ of execution" allowing for the seizure and auction of the properties -- a church, gym building, a warehouse, a restaurant, a house and a parking lot. Deeds list multiple current and former members of the Tony Alamo Christian Ministries as the owners of each real-estate parcel.

         Storm-aid details available online The City of North Little Rock has a webpage to help people with information about disaster relief in the aftermath of the March 31 tornado. The webpage -- https://bit.ly/3GKenDK -- includes tornado relief information, assistance and links to agencies such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency, American Red Cross and Arkansas governor's office. The city is also providing updates on social media. Individual, robust storms developed from north central to west central Arkansas by mid-day March 31, according to the National Weather Service. One of the storms moved from Saline County into Pulaski County, the weather service stated. A tornado developed and rapidly intensified across portions of west Little Rock, then moved northeast across Little Rock, North Little Rock, Sherwood and Jacksonville before dissipating south of Cabot in Lonoke County. The tornado produced 165 mph winds at its peak and remained on the ground for more than 30 miles, the weather service said. 9 youths going to Governor's School Nine students from the North Little Rock School District have been selected to participate in Arkansas Governor's School. The Arkansas Governor's School is a four-week summer residential program for upcoming high school seniors. The program is scheduled for July 5-Aug. 1 at Arkansas Tech University in Russellville. Students are selected on the basis of their special aptitudes in one of nine fields: choral music, development engineering, drama, English/Language Arts, instrumental music, mathematics, natural science, social science and visual arts. The North Little Rock students are: Jerzey Banks, drama, North Little Rock High School, alternate. Ryan Estrada, mathematics, Center of Excellence, alternate. Tyler Green, development engineering, Center of Excellence. Sang Huynh, development engineering, Center of Excellence. Callen Leonard, visual arts, North Little Rock High School. Lily Madden, visual arts, North Little Rock High School. Towns Passmore, mathematics, North Little Rock High School. Carley Walker, drama, Center of Excellence.

         HOT SPRINGS -- The Hot Springs Board of Directors has authorized the donation of four city-owned parcels for the expansion of the Arkansas School for Mathematics, Sciences and the Arts. The enabling resolution was on the lengthy consent agenda the board adopted earlier this month. The Academic and Administration Building at 200 Whittington Ave. was among the pieces of property the city wants the board of trustees of the University of Arkansas to accept. It's part of the old St. Joseph's Hospital complex the city acquired in 1992 in expectation of the residential public high school, which is part of the UA System, locating its campus in Hot Springs. The city purchased the complex from St. Joseph's Regional Health Center for $300,000, according to the ordinance authorizing the purchase. The school began leasing the property for $1 a year in 1993, with the city donating pieces as the school implemented its redevelopment plan. Last summer the city donated land where the school's Student Center Courtyard and hospital's chapel and convent are located. The new administration building is under construction on the donated land that was split from the main hospital parcel facing Whittington. The city pressed the school to commit to a timeline for vacating the current administration building before it endorsed the donation last May. According to the agenda of the university board's March meeting, 200 Whittington is the school's primary classroom building. The city said the building accounted for most of the roughly $700,000 it's spent on maintenance and operation of the hospital complex over a five-year period that ended in 2021, including $366,809 for two new elevator systems. "The maintenance cost on that building is pretty extensive," City Attorney Brian Albright, noting that the school has helped with some of the costs, including a new roof, told the city board last month. "If this conveyance were approved, it would eliminate much of the maintenance costs the city has in relation to this building." The school told the city board last spring that it expected to vacate 200 Whittington and the balance of the hospital property by 2024. A letter the UA System sent its board last month confirmed the date. "2024 will bring a critical juncture as ASMSA completes the exit from the hospital complex," the letter seeking to hire an architect said. "That move sets the stage for crafting a shared vision of how ASMSA's campus will continue to grow and evolve in the decade ahead." The parking lot behind the dormitories and 9 undeveloped acres behind the parking lot were also included in the donation the city board authorized earlier this month. The city said it will need a ground lease and easement for its communications tower on the hill behind campus. The city agreed to demolish the old hospital complex after the school's exit. The nonbinding commitment was made in 2010 after the city donated more than 2 acres for the school's Student Center. The cost of razing and abating the complex represents one of the city's largest unfunded liabilities, notwithstanding the $2 million that's been set aside. A committee appointed by City Manager Bill Burrough to prioritize more than $40 million in unfunded capital needs ranked the demolition as the 12th most urgent of the 18 projects it was asked to consider. The city board is expected to ratify the rankings later this year. The city has said the 2010 estimate of $1.75 million to raze and clear the property has more than doubled.

         Storms brought high winds and hail to Arkansas on Saturday evening, with severe thunderstorm warnings extending into the night, National Weather Service forecasts showed. A system of storms expected to produce winds of up to 60 miles per hour and hail up to 1 inch in diameter was moving across the state by 6:45 p.m., a tweet from the National Weather Service in Little Rock showed. By 7 p.m., the storm was moving across the Little Rock metro area. Forecasters at the National Weather Service station in North Little Rock did not want to speak on the storm that was still developing Saturday evening, saying it might take a few more hours for them to have a full picture of the storm's effects. At 3:34 p.m. Saturday, the weather service reported golf ball-size hail as the storms moved east-northeast from Pope County into Searcy County. About four hours later, the weather service's website indicated that hail had been reported in more than a dozen counties, including Benton, Columbia, Crawford, Garland, Grant, Independence, Logan, Lonoke, Ouachita, Pope, Pulaski, Saline, Sebastian, Stone, Van Buren and Washington. More than 5,200 households in North Little Rock were without power about 7:30 p.m., according to the city Electric Department's website. Entergy Arkansas' online power outage map showed that about 4,000 customers in the Little Rock area and roughly 2,400 customers in the Russellville area were without power around 7 p.m. An outage map from the Electric Cooperatives of Arkansas reported about 9,100 customers without power in Central Arkansas by 7 p.m., most of them in Perry, Cleburne and Conway counties, with another 1,200 in the dark in Fulton County in the northern part of the state.

         HOT SPRINGS -- After three years of sitting unused at the plaza on the south entrance to the Grand Promenade on Reserve Street in Hot Springs, the Noble Fountain is flowing again. Named for John W. Noble, who was secretary of the Interior from 1889 to 1893 under President Benjamin Harrison, the fountain has a long history in Hot Springs National Park. "The Noble Fountain was designed in the 1890s, and why it's called the Noble Fountain is because the secretary of the Interior in 1892, when the money was appropriated, was a guy named John W. Noble," Tom Hall, museum curator for Hot Springs National Park, said. "When the fountain finally was installed in 1896, they named it after him because he had provided the money to create improvements in Hot Springs Reservation at the time, not just the fountains, but also Whittington Park, the formal entrance, several other improvements in trails and access." The waterlines and drain lines for the fountain had gotten clogged with mineral buildups over several years of use, Hall said. "The minerals in the water, as it's coming through the pipes, will build up on the inside of the pipes, so that eventually will close off the supply line," he said. "So maintenance people will have to come through and open up the supply lines again for water and get to the fountain. Plus, there can be leaks in the drain for the fountain, too. "The fountain itself has been clogged before, so it had been off for a while because different pieces of it needed to be repaired. Our maintenance staff just recently got it back in working order and got the supply line working and the drain line working, and it's now back in where people can drink from the fountain and interact with the water." The fountain was designed by Edward Kemeys, a well-known sculptor of animals whose works include the lions at the entrance to the Art Institute of Chicago. The fountain is not the only sculpture he has displayed in the national park. "So Kemeys also designed the eagles that are on top of the formal entrance pylons between the Fordyce and the Maurice [bath houses]," Hall said. "The fountain was designed in 1894, and then they finally got it built and installed in 1896." While most people are quite familiar with the fountain's current placement, that is its third home, having started at the end of the Magnolia Promenade in front of Bathhouse Row. "This fountain was originally at the south end of the Magnolia Promenade, the sidewalk in front of the bath houses, and there was a fountain at the other end, up by where the Arlington Hotel used to be on Bathhouse Row, called the Hoke Smith Fountain, which was created at a different time under a different secretary of the Interior, so it had a different name," Hall said, referring to Michael Hoke Smith, Noble's successor under President Grover Cleveland. "But the Noble Fountain was out near the street, which wasn't a problem early on, but as more and more vehicles began to show up and bigger and bigger trucks (were) going up the highway, they were afraid that fountain was going to get hit." The fountain was then moved in front of the Administration Building, where a small Magnolia tree is currently located, in 1945. "In the meantime, they were building the Grand Promenade, and they wanted this south entrance plaza to have a really good focus design feature," Hall said. "So they moved the fountain from down there to where it is now in 1957. Then the promenade was finished in the late '50s, so that's the plaza that we have today." Hall has been the curator for the national park's museum since 2011, and he is in charge of approximately 685,000 objects -- most of which are maps, photographs and other archival documents -- and helps design the exhibits in the Fordyce and Ozark bath houses.

         Northwest Arkansas and the River Valley need more inpatient psychiatric beds, according to local health leaders and community organizations. There are 286 inpatient psychiatric beds in Washington County, some of which are reserved for certain ages or people who have served in the military. There are none in Benton County. "The demand for inpatient behavioral health services is growing, commensurate with the general population growth we're seeing in Northwest Arkansas," said Christina Bull, spokesperson for Northwest Health. The primary need for inpatient psychiatric services in Northwest Arkansas is for mental health beds dedicated to child, adolescent and geriatric patients, though adult care could be better as well, according to Dr. Aaron Carson with the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences Psychiatry Clinic in Fayetteville. The increased numbers of patients with issues related to trauma, stress and substance abuse from the covid-19 pandemic continue to need more providers, according to Carson. "The population has outpaced our resources," he said. "We've had a high demand for care across the region." Sebastian County has 137 inpatient psychiatric beds. Crystal Lougin, director of behavioral health at Baptist Health Fort Smith and Van Buren, said there is a general need for more inpatient hospitalization opportunities for child and geriatric patients in the River Valley as well. Arkansas ranks 45th among U.S. states in access to mental health care, according to the nonprofit Mental Health America. According to the organization's October 2022 report, 230,000 Arkansans with a mental illness did not receive any treatment during the previous year. The number of psychiatric beds in the United States has dropped significantly the last 60 years, and a lack of access to treatment can lead to homelessness or involvement in the criminal justice system, according to the American Psychiatric Association. Assessing the necessary number of psychiatric beds in a given region is complex because it is impacted by the availability of other services, according to a May 2022 report by the association. The region also needs additional outpatient services, which are used by both patients transitioning out of inpatient care as well as those who have not needed inpatient treatment, said Jordon Babcock, chief executive officer of Springwoods Behavioral Health. A waitlist for such services can last months, he said. "If you have more access to outpatient care, it can reduce the need for inpatient care," Lougin said. "You're looking at preventative care in that regard." Ryan Cork with the Northwest Arkansas Council, a nonprofit organization with members from the region's largest business, education and health care organizations, said responses to the council's recent mental health care survey indicated access to care is lacking. BARRIERS TO CARE Affordability may be an issue as well. The federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration found in a report from a 2020 national survey cost was the most common reason Americans did not receive mental health services. Next to child care, mental health care was reported as one of the least affordable essential services, according to a 2021 national survey by management consulting firm McKinsey & Co. Among Arkansans enrolled in large employer health plans, adults with a mental illness averaged higher out-of-pocket spending than adults without mental illness, according to 2021 data analyzed by the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation. Some community organizations have said it can be difficult to find inpatient care for people experiencing a mental health crisis. "It's kind of like an alignment of the stars," said Debbie Rambo, executive director of Samaritan Community Center in Rogers. "For a lot of families, the lack of inpatient facilities is pretty stifling. That has societal woes. They start missing work, then lose their job and then lose their housing." One in five Americans experiences a mental illness, and one in 25 Americans lives with a serious mental illness like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or depression, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Dr. Upton Siddons, family doctor with Baptist Health Family Clinic in Greenwood, said mental health care addresses a common need, albeit one brought about by everyday stressors, life experiences and family histories. People diagnosed with serious mental illnesses may need inpatient behavioral health treatment, where they can stay in a safe and separate environment for several days. A common criteria for inpatient psychiatric care is that the patients are at extreme risk of harming themselves or others, according to Lougin. Inpatient behavioral health programs like the one at Northwest Medical Center in Springdale are intended to help those experiencing mental health crises that have left them unable to safely care for themselves, Bull said. The length of stay and the specific care will vary between individuals, but the goal is to help each person recover and return to the community or a lower level of care, she said. NWA FACILITIES Northwest Medical Center is the only acute care hospital in the area with an inpatient psychiatric unit. The unit opened with 15 beds in 2009 and has expanded several times over the years. Its 77 beds saw more than 1,600 patients in 2022, according to Bull. The unit is currently 90% full and consistently maintains a high occupancy, she said. Springwoods Behavioral Health in Fayetteville has had 80 beds since 2009, according to Babcock. Half of the beds are reserved for adolescents – ages 12 to 17 – and half for adults, he said. Springwoods saw an estimated 2,000 patients last year through its inpatient services, which are running at about 75% capacity, he said. The facility sees "pretty heavy demand" for inpatient services and sometimes has a waitlist for adolescent beds during the school year, he said. Springwoods has seen increased demand in the areas of substance abuse and adolescent care in recent years, he said. Its psychiatric emergency room last year saw three times as many patients for substance abuse compared to 2018, he said. Vantage Point Behavioral Health Hospital in Fayetteville has 114 beds, according to the state Department of Health. The beds are available for ages 5 and up, the facility's website states. A Vantage Point representative declined to speak about the facility. Acadia Healthcare, the company that owns Vantage Point, did not respond to calls. Veterans Health Care System of the Ozarks has a behavioral health unit with 15 beds reserved for veterans in its 22-county coverage area. The Fayetteville behavioral health unit has recently seen an average daily patient population of five people, which is representative of last year, though that number can be deceiving, said Dr. Reba Glidewell, associate chief of staff, mental health service. Sometimes the beds have been nearly empty while they have all been full at other times, she said. The Northwest Arkansas Crisis Stabilization Unit, a partnership between Washington County and the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, is an alternative to inpatient psychiatric hospitals, emergency departments and jails, according to program Director Kristen McAllister. The unit, one of four crisis stabilization units in the state, has 16 beds for people experiencing behavioral health crises. The crisis stabilization unit receives people from inpatient units and may transfer someone to inpatient psychiatric facilities if their condition worsens, she said. RIVER VALLEY Baptist Health Fort Smith is the only geriatric inpatient psychiatric unit in the River Valley, according to Lougin. The facility opened in 2003, and its 23 beds are reserved specifically for people 55 and older, she said. The unit admits 45 patients a month and averages about 18 patients staying in the unit each day, she said. There is typically not a waitlist for the facility, she said. The facility saw a decline in patients about eight months into the pandemic and is just beginning to see a return to pre-pandemic numbers this year, Lougin said. The numbers do not necessarily indicate a decline in need for services, she said. Many of the facility's referrals come from assisted living centers and nursing homes, many of which were not sending out patients at the time but have since resumed. Valley Behavioral Health System in Barling has 114 beds, according to the state Health Department. A representative of Valley Behavioral, which is owned by Acadia Healthcare, declined to comment. The Sebastian County Crisis Stabilization Unit in Fort Smith, an alternative to inpatient psychiatric units, has 16 beds. PIECES OF THE PUZZLE Health care providers and community organizations are aiming to address the demand for mental health care in a variety of ways. At the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Carson is leading an effort to begin a psychiatry residency for medical students in Fayetteville. Retaining and recruiting psychiatrists has been a national issue to which the region has not been immune, he said. The goal is to start the residency in 2025, though that timeline is not certain, according to Carson. Veterans Health Care System of the Ozarks is building a new 20,321-square-foot facility for inpatient behavioral health. The $13 million building, scheduled to open this fall, will provide a better layout and facility for the VA's inpatient care, but will not expand its capacity, according to Glidewell. A mental health counseling center with providers and student interns will be a part of the Samaritan Community Center's new 41,000-square-foot facility in southeast Rogers, according to Rambo. Inpatient care will not be a part of the counseling center. Services at the counseling center not covered by Medicaid will be charitable care, she said. The construction project is planned for completion in September, she said. Springwoods Behavioral Health is looking at expanding with two new outpatient locations in Northwest Arkansas, Babcock said. The Northwest Arkansas Council is in the early stages of working with the University of Arkansas' McMillon Innovation Studio with hopes of creating an inpatient psychiatric bed dashboard. Cork, executive director of the council's health care transformation division, said he has heard a story about a health care provider having to make 90 calls before finding an available bed in a behavioral health unit. Judd Semingson, chief executive officer of Springdale-based Community Clinic, said he expects the inpatient psychiatric bed dashboard to help clinicians. "There is a need, and I don't think it's going to be one piece of the puzzle that any of us solves," he said.  None  Mental and behavioral health in Arkansas Members of the Arkansas Legislature are conducting an ongoing study of the strengths and weaknesses of the states mental and behavioral health care. The Arkansas Legislative Study on Mental and Behavioral Health, established by Act 802 in 2021, will lead to policy recommendations to the General Assembly. The timeline for the study was extended by the recently signed Act 512 of 2023, which determined that the committees involved in the study will continue the study and submit a final written report no later than Oct. 31, 2024. Recommendations in the report will be considered by the legislature during the 2025 regular session, according to the law. The House Committee on Public Health, Welfare, and Labor and the Senate Committee on Public Health, Welfare, and Labor are studying access to and availability of mental and behavioral health care in Arkansas; existing mental and behavioral healthcare facilities in the state; Medicaid programs regarding mental and behavioral health and other public and private medical reimbursements for mental and behavioral healthcare providers and facilities; best practices for provision of mental and behavioral health services; mental and behavioral health programs in other states; the utilization and financial condition of the crisis stabilization units and the Arkansas State Hospital; transportation of mental and behavioral health patients in Arkansas; the rate of deaths by suicide of school-aged children in the state; mental health screenings and suicide prevention measures for children in kindergarten through high school; and other matters related to mental and behavioral health services.

         Stolen gun found after traffic stop The Arkansas State Police on Friday arrested a man who they say illegally had two guns, one of which was stolen, during a traffic stop. A trooper pulled over Cleo Nellum, 41, of Jacksonville around 10 p.m. on U.S. 67/167 near Redmond Road because he was speeding, according to an arrest report. Nellum had a felony warrant out of Jacksonville, and a search of the vehicle uncovered a Glock pistol under the driver's seat and a .357 magnum revolver in the trunk which had been reported stolen by Little Rock police, the report says. Nellum faces two felony counts of possession of a firearm by a certain person and a felony charge of theft by receiving of a firearm. Nellum was taken to the Pulaski County jail Friday night, but he did not appear in the jail's online inmate roster Saturday evening.

         Honor Flight of the Ozarks has extended its reach into Arkansas to give more veterans a chance to see the memorials built in their honor in the nation's capital. Thirteen Arkansas counties -- Benton, Washington, Carroll, Madison, Newton, Boone, Marion, Searcy, Baxter, Stone, Fulton, Izard and Sharp -- were added to the Ozarks hub as were Oregon and Shannon counties in Missouri, according to a March news release from Honor Flight of the Ozarks. Honor Flight Network, a national organization, expanded the territory of Honor Flight of the Ozarks, according to the release. The hub previously had covered all of southwest Missouri, said Gary Ellison, a volunteer for Honor Flights of the Ozarks. "We believe there are a whole lot of veterans from Northwest Arkansas who have not gone on an Honor Flight," Ellison said. Jeff Miller and Earl Morse created Honor Flight Network in 2005 with the simple mission of honoring the nation's veterans by bringing them to Washington, D.C., to visit the memorials built to commemorate their service and sacrifice. While initially focused on America's World War II veterans, Honor Flight Network has expanded its mission to include those who served during the Korean and Vietnam wars and veterans of any service era who are critically ill, according to the website honorflight.org. According to U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs statistics, 167,284 of the 16 million Americans who served in World War II were alive in 2022. Each Honor Flight takes a veteran and guardian on a daylong trip to Washington, D.C., to see the World War II Memorial, the Korean War Memorial, the Vietnam Memorial, the Lincoln Memorial, the Air Force Memorial, the Marine Corps Memorial and the Changing of the Guard at Arlington National Cemetery, according to the release. Honor Flight Network is a national nonprofit organization composed of independent hubs that work together to achieve the Honor Flight mission, according to honorflight.org. The 124 hubs serve 44 states and have transported more than 260,000 veterans since the program started, according to the website. "It's a wonderful program that gives our veterans the chance to experience our nation's monuments that were erected in their honor," said Patrick Robinson, Benton County Veteran Services director. It's a long day as each group meets at the Springfield-Branson National Airport around 5:30 a.m. and returns to the airport around 10 p.m., Ellison said. Honor Flight of the Ozarks, which began operating in 2014, took three flights to Washington, D.C., last year after being grounded because of covid-19 in 2020 and 2021, Ellison said. The next flight for Honor Flight of the Ozarks set for May 17 is full, Ellison said. Other trips scheduled in August and September are mostly filled out, he said. There are vacancies for next year, and eligible veterans are urged to fill out an application, he said. Applications can be found online at honorflightoftheozarks.org, according to the release.

         JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. -- Missouri conservation officials are preparing to launch a program aimed at ridding the waters of the Mississippi River of an invasive species. In a request for bids issued last week, the Missouri Department of Conservation is seeking a vendor to manage a program that will pay commercial fish harvesters an incentive to sweep two sections of the river of four types of carp. The department claims populations of invasive carp, including bighead, black, grass and silver, have rapidly expanded throughout the state and the Mississippi River basin, including places like Creve Coeur Lake in Maryland Heights. "Management and control of invasive carp is necessary to reduce their impact on native species, the ecosystem and the economy," bidding documents note. The fish typically starve out native sport fish and wipe out endangered mussel and snail populations. In some cases, the fish will jump out of the water and injure boaters. Under the plan, the vendor will contract with commercial fish companies and pay them between 7 and 10 cents per pound for invasive fish that are being sold to a processor, wholesaler or other buyers. Cost estimates for the program were not immediately available, but 1 million pounds of fish would equate to a payout of $100,000 from the state. The focus will be on two sections of the Mississippi River on Missouri's eastern border, including a southern stretch along the Bootheel region from the Arkansas border to the confluence of the Ohio River near Cairo, Ill. The northern stretch covers the river between Hannibal and the Iowa border. Conservation Department spokesman Joe Jerek said the vendor will make money on the project by charging the state a fee for "project management." Funding is coming from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Jerek said this is the first time Missouri has initiated a program like those that have netted millions of pounds of fish in other states and waterways. The aim of an Illinois River program is to stop the fish from entering Lake Michigan and proliferating in the Great Lakes. In September 2019, for example, a similar effort on the Illinois River resulted in the removal of more than 500,000 pounds of carp from the Peoria area. In each of the next two years, fish harvesters hauled in more than 5 million pounds of the fish, according to the Illinois Department of Natural Resources. In Tennessee, state wildlife officials said 10 million pounds of fish have been removed since an incentive program was launched there in 2018. The invasive species migrated to waterways in the state via locks at Kentucky and Barkley dams on the Cumberland River in Kentucky. Once caught, the fish are typically sold to processing companies that produce fertilizer, catfish and crayfish, bat and fish oil. There also is a push to get the carp onto more dinner plates. In Illinois, officials launched a rebranding effort last year to rename the fish "Copi," in an attempt to get more people to consume carp. The new name is a play on the word "copious." Changing a fish's name has been a successful strategy for other fish. Orange roughy was originally known as slimehead; Chilean sea bass was known as Patagonian toothfish; and peekytoe crab was once known as mud crab.

         7 in state finalists for teaching award Seven Arkansas teachers have been named 2023 state finalists for the Presidential Awards for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching. The National Science Foundation, on behalf of The White House, oversees the program that recognizes outstanding teachers who have demonstrated a commitment to professional development, innovative teaching techniques and technology use in their classrooms. The teachers are now eligible to be considered for recognition by the national committee. Mathematics finalists are: Laura Tinsley, Conway High School, Conway School District. Morgan Trevathan, Annie Camp Junior High School, Jonesboro School District. Theresa Watson, Arkansas School for Mathematics, Sciences and the Arts. Science finalists are: Christopher Coker, Camden Fairview High School, Camden Fairview School District. Melisha Griffin, North Little Rock Center of Excellence, North Little Rock School District. Patrycja Krakowiak, Arkansas School for Mathematics, Sciences and the Arts. Mary Maris, Central High School, Little Rock School District. Each year a national committee of scientists, mathematicians and educators recommends up to 108 teachers to receive presidential excellence awards in mathematics, science and computer science. Winners are chosen from each state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. territories, and schools operated in the United States and overseas by the Department of Defense Education Activity. Teachers who are selected as national presidential excellence awardees each receive a $10,000 award, a presidential citation and a trip to Washington, D.C., for a series of recognition events, professional development activities and an awards ceremony. Applications taken to operate district The Arkansas Department of Education has set noon April 18 as a deadline for organizations to notify the agency of their interest in serving as a third-party operator of what is now the state-controlled Marvell-Elaine School District in Phillips County. The state Board of Education voted on Thursday to assume authority of the 306-student district and directed Education Secretary Jacob Oliva to explore entering into a transformation contract with a third party to operate the district as permitted by the new Arkansas LEARNS Act. Act 237 of 2023 authorized a school district that has a D- or F-rated school or is in need of "Level 5 --intensive support" to be exempted from sanctions if the school board contracts with a charter school or another entity to operate a public school district transformation campus. A commissioner's memo was distributed Friday inviting organizations to submit an intent to negotiate for the contract, which would go into effect in the 2023-24 school year. Those intentions are to be submitted by email to Stacy.Smith@ade.arkansas.gov. Quiz Bowl finals set to air on PBS Quiz Bowl 2023, which is the annual Arkansas Governor's Academic Competition for high school students, will be broadcast April 22 on Arkansas PBS, beginning at 9 a.m. Additionally, the event showcasing the intellect of high school students across the state will be livestreamed at myarpbs.org/watch. The first rounds of the contest will be from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m., and the second round will be from 1:30 p.m.-4:30 p.m. A total of 14 teams in seven conferences will compete in the state finals for scholarship money. The first round of matches will include in order of appearance: 7A -- Fayetteville High School vs. Conway High School. 4A -- Bauxite High School vs. Arkadelphia High School. 5A -- Valley View High School vs. Batesville Charter High School. 3A -- Mountain View High School vs. Haas Hall Academy Fayetteville. Matches will resume at 1:30 p.m. and feature in order of appearance: 6A -- Russellville High School vs. Benton High School. 1A -- Sacred Heart Catholic School vs. Norfork High School. 2A -- Haas Hall Academy Bentonville vs. Life Way Christian School. Each match will last about one hour. Matches will be available to stream on YouTube at myarpbs.org/2023quizbowlplaylist in the week following the broadcast. "Quiz Bowl" has been an Arkansas PBS tradition since 1985. In a series of questions, players must display their knowledge in literature, math, science, history, art, music and economics. Teams from across the state compete for the chance to represent The Natural State in national tournaments. The Arkansas Governor's Quiz Bowl Association holds regional tournaments around the state in March. Teams are assigned to a site, and a random drawing places the teams on the pairing schedule. A percentage of teams in the tournament advance to the state tournament. The top two teams from each classification advance to the State Conference Finals.

         FORT SMITH -- Hopes are high as the Fort Chaffee Redevelopment Authority prepares to launch its next round of monthly outdoor markets. The Chaffee Crossing Farmers and Artisans Market will kick off its third season with a Hispanic fiesta-themed event May 13, according to the authority. The markets will run from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. on the second Saturdays of May through October in the Chaffee Crossing Historic and Entertainment District at 7300 Ellis St. Lorie Robertson, director of marketing for the authority, which oversees development of the Chaffee Crossing area, said the market is a community-building event that allows people to come together and both showcase their talents and sell their work. It also gives residents a chance to come to Chaffee Crossing and enjoy the sense of community that comes with the markets. "It has such a warm, welcoming, friendly vibe to it," Robertson said. "People just enjoy coming and staying. They enjoy visiting with the vendors, with the farmers, with the food service providers and listening to the live music, as well as just visiting with their neighbors, encountering people they haven't seen in years or perhaps making new friends." The market's focus is homegrown, homemade and handmade products; original art, designs and creations; and local musicians and performers, according to Robertson. The authority is interested in having more farmers participate. Robertson said the authority expects this year's markets to start strongly May 13. At least 60 vendors were registered as of April 3. Robertson believes it will "easily" have more than 100. "We have a lot of repeat vendors, but we also have new vendors, and we have quite a few folks that are signing up to be season vendors because they see the value of the market," she said.    Robertson said the first Farmers and Artisans Market in May 2021 featured 15 vendors and capped that initial season with about 120 vendors in October 2021. More than 150 vendors attended the most recent market in October, with the 2022 season seeing more than 250 total unique vendors participate, according to a news release. One such vendor is Payton McMahan, owner of Payton's Custom Designs in Chaffee Crossing. McMahan said 2023 will be her third year as a season vendor for the market, meaning she's set to sell her wares at every event. Payton's Custom Designs makes a variety of items, such as T-shirts, hats, cups and bags. McMahan said she enjoys seeing the market grow. She believes her participation as a vendor has given her confidence. "I don't think that my business would be what it is today without the market, 100 percent, just because of how many people have come out and told me, 'We came just to see your booth,'" McMahan said. "Things like that are what give small businesses the courage to keep doing what they're doing, take that leap of faith every day because you never know how business is going to be with this world being the way it is." Each market will carry a specific theme. Robertson said the authority wants to showcase and celebrate the Hispanic community in the River Valley with its fiesta kickoff. The authority is organizing the event with two senior students from the University of Arkansas at Fort Smith: Angel Fernandez and Daniel Lafuente. "Dr. Kristin Tardif teaches a community leadership class at UAFS and she contacted us and asked if we could work with two students who are doing a capstone project, and they had the idea to do a Hispanic fiesta," Robertson said. Fernandez and Lafuente are both pursuing business administration degrees. They said Tardif told them and their classmates they would come up with some type of project to work with community leaders that would also involve the community at large. Lafuente said Tardif connected him and Fernandez to Robertson after they thought about doing something in detail with the Hispanic community, which led to their involvement in the market. Fernandez said they didn't realize the full scope of the event until Robertson explained it to them. "It was definitely surprising," Lafuente said. "It was a bit more than we probably anticipated, but looking at it now, if it works out the way we imagine it to, then I can see it being something really, really good for the community. I mean, it would help out a lot of people." Fernandez said one of his objectives with the Hispanic fiesta is to have the Hispanic community involved at Chaffee Crossing to increase the community's awareness of the area. Lafuente said he wants the event to foster greater collaboration between Hispanic-owned businesses. "I feel like there's a lot of us out here, but we're all just separated and doing our own thing, so it would be nice to see these businesses working together and helping each other, boost each other up and bring the Hispanic economy up in Fort Smith even more," Lafuente said. The fiesta will feature local Hispanic music, food trucks and other forms of entertainment and vendors, according to Fernandez and Lafuente. The musical groups slated to perform include Inseparables De San Luis and Fuego Cruzado, with Fernandez being part of the former. Vendors have until May 5 to register for the kickoff event, according to the news release. They can apply online at chaffeecrossingfam.com or ask for an application by emailing market@chaffeecrossing.com or calling (479) 452-4554.

         FORT SMITH -- Leaders in river, rail and highway shipping discussed transportation challenges and the need to work together at a Western Arkansas Intermodal Authority and U.S. Maritime Administration round-table event Wednesday. Discussion during the event, held at the Peak Innovation Center, largely revolved around how the different shipping industries need to work together to succeed. Aimee Andres, executive director of Inland Rivers, discussed as moderator for the maritime panel how river transportation has fast and slow movement depending on water level, and the industry needs to be resilient to ship goods. "We are in the maritime world, we are in the river industry and everyone up here is an expert in the river industry, but we can't do it without trucks, we can't do it without rail because it's a transportation system," she said. Andres said river travel is as important as trucks. She said in 2020, 10 million tons of goods were shipped upstream on the Arkansas River. One truck can deliver only 22.5 tons of goods, she said. "But we still need those trucks to go to and from the terminal, to the warehouse, to the farm, et cetera. Our trucks matter and our river matters, so I truly wanted to put that into perspective," Andres said. Marty Shell with Five Rivers Distribution, a transportation and warehouse company based in Van Buren, agreed they couldn't be truly intermodal without the trucking and railroad industries. He said that will continue to improve in the River Valley once the Interstate 49 expansion is completed. The Arkansas Good Roads Foundation and the Arkansas Department of Transportation co-hosted a meeting last summer to inform highway commissioners about the economic impact the I-49 extension will have. The new section of I-49 will be built in phases and is expected to be four lanes and nearly 14 miles long, costing an estimated $800 million, according to the Department of Transportation. A new 7,800-foot bridge over the Arkansas River is priced at $250 million. Lorie Tudor, director of the Transportation Department, said during the meeting the bridge is the first phase of construction and will begin in 2024. The entire project is expected to be completed by 2030. Shell noted the River Valley has had several large floods in the last decade but has continued to rebuild and grow. "What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, and the River Valley is very, very resilient in making sure we are able to protect and conquer and bring more infrastructure into the area," he said. Andres said the River Valley went from shipping 14 million tons of goods per year before the historic flood in 2019 to a low of 7 million tons. She said that number has started to increase back to 10 million tons. "So building out and investing in our ports and our terminals that move those commodities that are sustainable, that can be resilient to these disasters, is crucial," she said.

"Quiz Bowl" has been an Arkansas PBS tradition since 1985. In a series of questions, players must display their knowledge in literature, math, science, history, art, music and economics. Teams from across the state compete for the chance to represent The Natural State in national tournaments. The Arkansas Governor's Quiz Bowl Association holds regional tournaments around the state in March. Teams are assigned to a site, and a random drawing places the teams on the pairing schedule. A percentage of teams in the tournament advance to the state tournament. The top two teams from each classification advance to the State Conference Finals.

         West Fork wanted a new bridge to replace the aging structure that carries Main Street over the West Fork of the White River next to Centennial Park, a popular swimming hole. So it struck a partnership with the Arkansas Department of Transportation to speed up the process, a growing trend in the region under the agency's partnership program. West Fork passed a resolution Feb. 22 to partner with the department, which owns the bridge, and the agency added the job to its list of projects, according to Chad Adams. Adams heads up Division 4 for the Transportation Department, which includes Washington County. "So we are still in the very early stages," Adams said. "We are currently targeting 2026 for this work." Mayor Heith Caudle said the city will get its bridge and, in exchange, will take over future maintenance of it and Arkansas 170, Main Street, through the city. "It's been something that we've been needing for a while. We'd been trying to get some traction for quite some time going through normal channels, and we weren't getting anywhere," Caudle said. "The state wasn't interested." Caudle said a friend with Brown and McDonald, an engineering firm, introduced him to the partnership program and offered to pitch the project to the department, free of charge. Within 60 days, the department said it was interested in partnering, Caudle said. "Our original bridge design was a three-lane bridge with pedestrian paths on both sides. The state said there's no way in the world they're going to build a bridge like that in West Fork," Caudle said. "So, we compromised, and we are getting a two-lane bridge with a 10-foot walkway on the north side of it." Caudle said the existing bridge was built in the late 1960s and is reaching the end of its life. He expects to see the state start survey work on the project in the summer. "It's been in bad shape. That deck on it, every time it rains it opens the pot holes," Caudle said, adding that maintenance on the bridge is "almost a full-time project." Caudle said because of the partnership program, the city won't spend any money building a new bridge. "What the partnership is, is we are going to take possession of Highway 170 from Interstate 49 to Highway 71," Caudle said. "They will basically do some improvements to that strip of road. They will replace the bridge with a new bridge and after that, maintenance of that piece of road will fall on the city of West Fork." Caudle said it's similar to the agreement Fayetteville made on U.S. 71B and Farmington made on U.S. 62B through those cities, which takes the roads off the state's plate, giving it fewer miles to maintain. The agreement will also free the city to make some other improvements on the street, Caudle said. "As it stands, if we want to do sidewalk improvements or anything like that, we've gotta go through the state authorities just to get permission to put a sidewalk within so many feet of it. There are some drainage issues that have been problems forever that the city can't fix," Caudle said. "It's going to give us the opportunity to do some things that really need to be done on that strip of road anyway and potentially better maintain it." Caudle said a safe way for pedestrians to cross the bridge is also badly needed. Owning the bridge does have one potential downside, he said. "The only scary part is in 50 years, the citizens of West Fork are going to have to figure out how to replace that bridge," Caudle said. "Whatever its lifespan is, that's going to fall on the city the next time it gets replaced. To me, that's the only downside, and we hope that we'd have enough economic growth between now and then to be able to replace it." EVERYONE BENEFITS Jared Wiley, assistant chief engineer for planning at the Transportation Department, said the partnering program, which began in the 1990s, speeds up the process and makes the department's money go further. It also provides incentives to local entities to participate and get projects done. Highway projects using federal money typically require a 20% state match, Wiley said. The partnering program has allowed the department to partner with entities that have a little bit of cash to bring to the table, Wiley said. "It accelerates projects because with the limited revenue that we've had, historically, a project would have to wait until the funding becomes available," Wiley said. "A lot of times partnering funding puts us over that fiscal hump, and we're able to begin project development" much earlier, he said. Wiley said today, the partnering program also gets $25 million a year from a dedicated road tax passed by state voters in 2020. Wiley said there's no one-size-fits-all partnership; they're all different. Sometimes it's cash. Several counties have passed local sales taxes to help fund projects. Other times, it may be a city will take over maintenance of a road, removing it from the state system, which is the case in West Fork. "That really helps us long-term," Wiley said, adding that because Arkansas has the 12th largest highway system in the country, "any relief we can get there certainly helps." Northwest Arkansas leads other areas in the state when it comes to partnering with the department. "Traditionally, we've seen a lot of interest in partnering from our friends in Northwest Arkansas," Wiley said. "I think it's just a matter of they have a lot of needs up there with the population growth they've seen over the past few decades, and they have been willing to contribute to projects to try to expedite the work that needs to be done." Tim Conklin, executive director at the Northwest Arkansas Regional Planning Commission, concurred. Projects around the region that have seen, or are currently undergoing, such partnerships include: improvements to U.S. 71B/Walnut Street in Rogers, U.S. 71B/College Avenue in Fayetteville, U.S. 62B in Prairie Grove, the J Street interchange in Bentonville, Arkansas 170 in Farmington and Arkansas 12/Arkansas 59 in Gentry. Older projects included Arkansas 265 through several cities on the east side of the metro area. "All four major Northwest Arkansas cities have all stepped up with local funds to advance ARDOT projects to improve mobility within their city and throughout the region," Conklin said.

        Artist Joan Benefiel is a committees choice to create the next sculpture at the Clinton Presidential Center to take the place of a sapling from Anne Franks chestnut tree originally dedicated to her in 2015. Benefiels unnamed prototype features a large chestnut tree branch “violently broken off” to symbolize the horror of the Holocaust. She said she hopes to have the community vote on a name for the piece. Inscribed on the tree is a quote from Frank: “What is done cannot be undone, but one can prevent it from happening again.” Figuration Studio is Benefiels artwork space in the Brooklyn borough of New York City. Benefiel said she only wished her husband, Jeremy, could have been in Little Rock to celebrate because it was “a partnership and a collaboration for our studio together.”  “Our family is really excited,” she said. “As artists and people in general to get to do a project like this, to get to do something that really means so much, is everything for us as artists. So were thrilled.” Benefiels husband is Jewish, and she said their children are “old enough now” to be “curious” and “wanting to learn” about their heritage. “Its just been such a great opportunity for us to start to have those conversations,” she said. “Which is just like a little example of, I think, what it will be for all kinds of folks, all kinds of families and people of all ages, so its really meaningful.” Her sculpture will be enclosed by five 10-foot-tall etched glass panels. One is dedicated to Frank, one contains excerpts from President Bill Clintons second inaugural address, and the rest convey messages from three other violent, discriminatory acts — the Indian Removal Act of 1830, the Central High crisis and the internment of Japanese Americans in Arkansas during World War II. The Sculpture at the River Market committee, the Clinton Foundation and the Sisterhood of the congregation of Bnai Israel will fund the artists work and installation at an undecided location at the William J. Clinton Library and Museum. Jane Rogers, president of the committee, said the sculpture should be available at the center for visitors by next May. “An absolutely wonderful piece of public art was chosen to convey the important message from Anne Frank,” Rogers said. “It shows an extension and good things happening at the end of a dark period. And I think that speaks to each one of the items, or each one of these situations on the panels that are already there at the Clinton Library.” Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        With a thunderstorm bearing down on Oaklawn Racing Casino Resort in Hot Springs as the gates flew open, Clairiere stormed past rival Secret Oath in the final lengths to win Saturday's Grade I $1 million Apple Blossom Stakes for older fillies and mares. Secret Oath, the winner of last year's Kentucky Oaks after taking third in last year's Arkansas Derby, took the lead from Hot and Sultry at the head of the stretch in Saturday's four-horse field and appeared headed to win with jockey Tyler Gallalione for Hall of Fame trainer D. Wayne Lukas. But Clairiere and jockey Joel Rosario charge down the stretch to win by a neck, giving trainer Steve Asmussen his third win in the Apple Blossom. Clairiere paid $5 and $2.40. Secret Oath paid $2.10. Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.  This document may not be reprinted without the express written permission of Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        The National Weather Service on Saturday extended a severe weather warning for parts of north Arkansas, while issuing a severe weather warning for Russellville, Dardanelle and Atkins. The warning for those three communities was set to last until 5:45 p.m., while the extended warning for Mountain View, Clinton and Fairfield Bay was set to expire at 5:30 p.m. Saturday. Hail as large as 2 inches had been reported in north Arkansas, and hail the size of golf balls was reported at 5:08 p.m. Saturday as the storm moved into Stone and Cleburne counties. A severe weather warning was also issued for Mount Ida, Oden and Crystal Springs until 5:45 p.m. Saturday. The National Weather Service reported that the storm in that area could produce quarter-sized hail and 60 mph winds. The warnings followed a severe thunderstorm watch issued at around 4:15 p.m. Saturday. That covered most of southern Arkansas, the Central Arkansas area around Little Rock and a large portion of northeast Arkansas, and was set to expire at 10 p.m. Saturday. 3:50 p.m.: Hail reported in multiple Northwest Arkansas counties as storms move through state Hail was reported in Northwest Arkansas on Saturday afternoon as a line of severe storms moves through the state. At 3:34 p.m. Saturday, the National Weather Service reported hail the size of golf balls as the storms moved east-northeast from Pope County into Searcy County. That report followed one from the service shortly after 3 p.m. that hail stones of up to 2 inches had been reported in the Fort Smith area.  11:05 a.m.: Forecasters: Risk of severe weather for most of state on Saturday A line of severe storms that could produce high winds and large hail is in Arkansas' forecast Saturday evening, according to the National Weather Service.  The weather service has issued a severe thunderstorm watch for Northwest Arkansas and the River Valley until 7 p.m. Saturday. [WEATHER RADAR: Click here for updates » arkansasonline.com/radar] The storm front — which has a majority of the state under an enhanced risk of severe weather — could contain golf ball-sized hail and winds as strong as 80 mph, a severe weather briefing from the weather service in North Little Rock said. The National Weather Service defines an enhanced risk as several severe storms that could produce very large hail, damaging winds or a tornado, a tweet from the weather service said. "The primary hazards with these storms will be large hail and damaging winds; however, a tornado cannot be ruled out," the briefing said on Saturday morning.  According to the National Weather Service, the entire state has the potential to see large hail, but latest trends show these thunderstorms being most impactful across western and central Arkansas. In Central Arkansas, the area is forecast at having up to 44% chance of seeing hail. According to the weather service's modeling, the storms will start to develop around 4 p.m. and will begin forming into a line as they approach the Little Rock metro around 6 p.m.  By 7 p.m., the storms could form into an organized line stretching across the state. The forecast has the storms starting to leave the state around 9 p.m., the briefing said.  "Discrete cells that develop ahead of the main line of storms will have the potential to produce tornadoes," the briefing said.  Central and eastern Arkansas could see up to an inch and a half of rain as a result of the storm.

        Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Friday announced she had vetoed three bills and partially vetoed a fourth, objecting to measures ranging from the creation of a heart attack task force to stipend raises for members of a state board. The vetoes, which Sanders announced in letters addressed to the top lawmakers in the Arkansas Senate and House of Representatives, are the first the Republican governor has made since she was inaugurated Jan. 10. House Bill 1189, which aims to create a state-based license for behavior analysts, is among the bills Sanders vetoed in its entirety. Behavior analysts are professionals who help treat patients with mental and social disorders such as autism. In a letter, Sanders said the legislation "creates unnecessary and overburdensome regulation" for behavior analysts. The governor noted these professionals are already subject to regulation and certified by the Behavior Analyst Certification Board, a nonprofit corporation that provides certification on a national level. "Creating duplicative licenses with new fees attached is additional red tape that does not ensure additional protections for the public," Sanders said in the letter. The bill's sponsor, Rep. Nicole Clowney, D-Fayetteville, said on Friday she had worked on the legislation publicly for months without opposition from the governor. She noted the bill had received bipartisan support in both state chambers and was broadly backed by Arkansas behavior analysts. "At the end of the day, what I'm most disappointed by is that Arkansans who need protection won't get it," she said in an interview. [DOCUMENTS: Read three of the bills vetoed » arkansasonline.com/415hbsbveto/] Under the current certification system, Clowney said Arkansans have to bring complaints against certified behavior analysts to a board outside the state. "That national board is not serving Arkansans as well as an Arkansas board would," she said. The state license system would require analysts to undergo criminal background checks, which Clowney said is not a part of the national certification. She also said she was unaware of any state laws that require analysts to receive certification before practicing in Arkansas and noted the certification is not a license. She said that all states surrounding Arkansas require licenses for analysts. While Clowney said she does not plan to challenge the veto, she said she and other supporters still feel a fix is needed. HEART ATTACK TASK FORCE Sanders also vetoed House Bill 1622, which aims to create a heart attack task force, saying it would duplicate the Arkansas STEMI Advisory Council. The STEMI Advisory Council, which is overseen by the Arkansas Department of Health, was formed to tackle ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction, a type of heart attack. The voluntary panel consists of health care providers and public health professionals, according to the Department of Health's website. Rep. Andrew Collins, D-Little Rock, who sponsored House Bill 1622, said in an interview Friday that the veto was an unfortunate decision and represented a misunderstanding of what he intended to accomplish with the bill. The heart attack task force would not duplicate the STEMI Advisory Council. Rather the council would serve as the core of the task force, he said. Collins said he was disappointed Arkansans would not benefit from the positive impact he expected the task force would have in addressing the high rate of heart attack mortality in Arkansas. "It seems like a task force is a nonstarter for this governor regardless of what it does or how useful it is," he said. "That's the signal I'm getting from this veto." Collins said he did not plan to challenge the veto. [DOCUMENT: Read the full appropriations bill partially vetoed » arkansasonline.com/415hb1176/] STIPENDS Sanders vetoed Senate Bill 509, which would boost the maximum permitted daily stipend for members of the Arkansas Board of Corrections from $85 to $110. In a letter, Sanders said the increase "cannot be justified to Arkansas taxpayers." "As Governor, I made a commitment to the State of Arkansas that I would look for ways to reduce government waste and ensure that tax dollars are spent wisely," Sanders said. "Elected officials have a responsibility to eliminate unnecessary spending at every level of state government." Rep. Jack Fortner, R-Yellville, who sponsored the bill, said he was disappointed by the decision, noting the increase in his bill was minimal. Nevertheless, Fortner said he understood the stance Sanders has taken to reduce government. "Governor Sanders and I are good friends and have worked together all session," he said. "This will not affect our relationship." APPROPRIATION Sanders vetoed a section of House Bill 1176, advanced by the Joint Budget Committee, that would provide an appropriation of $5 million for pandemic-related expenses for the Arkansas Department of Corrections. "During my first days in office, I terminated several existing Executive Orders related to the COVID-19 pandemic," Sanders said in a letter. "I believe in freedom and personal responsibility – not COVID mandates or shutdowns. The COVID-19 pandemic is over." Sen. Jonathan Dismang, R-Beebe, said the section of the bill Sanders vetoed was an unfunded appropriation that would have no impact on the Department of Corrections. The vetoes send the bills back to the General Assembly where lawmakers may override Sanders' objections with a simple majority vote in both chambers. The Senate and House of Representatives voted April 7 to recess the regular session until May 1 or sooner.

        The sentencing of Richard "Bigo" Barnett in connection with the U.S. Capitol riot has been postponed from May 3 to May 24. U.S. District Judge Christopher R. Cooper filed an order Friday morning granting a motion from the defense to postpone Barnett's sentencing hearing. Federal prosecutors opposed the request. After a two-week trial in January, a jury in Washington, D.C., found Barnett guilty of eight charges in connection with the riot that occurred two years earlier, on Jan. 6, 2021. Barnett faced enhanced charges for carrying a stun gun into the Capitol, where he posed for photos with his foot on a desk in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office suite. Barnett faces a maximum penalty of 47 years in prison. Jonathan Gross, one of Barnett's attorneys, filed a motion Monday night saying a 107-page decision issued last week by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia "raises new issues that directly and specifically impact Mr. Barnett's case." Gross requested more time to "properly review and analyze the complicated decision" in United States v. Fischer and decide whether he needs to file supplements to Barnett's motions for acquittal or a new trial. In a filing Wednesday, federal prosecutors said, "No such continuance is justified." They argued that the appeals court decision in Fischer concerns defendants who "assaulted" police officers during the Capitol riot, and Barnett wasn't accused of assault. Regarding the Fischer decision, the prosecutors wrote, "The Circuit court confirmed that the government may charge individuals who allegedly assaulted law enforcement officers while participating in the Capitol riot with corruptly obstructing, influencing, or impeding an official proceeding, specifically Congress's certification of the Electoral College vote, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1512(c)(2). "The defendant -- who was not alleged to have assaulted law enforcement officers but who was convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. § 1512(c)(2) on a different theory -- asserts that the Fischer decision 'raises new issues that directly and specifically impact' his case but does not identify the issues or explain the impact." The Fischer decision doesn't affect Barnett's sentencing guidelines calculation or other sentencing factors, according to the prosecutors. Sentencing memoranda in the case are now due May 17.

        For the past two weeks, churches, nonprofits and other aid groups in Arkansas have adapted on the fly to meet the changing needs of hundreds of residents whose lives were upended by tornadoes. Now that survivors' immediate necessities have largely been met and the outpouring of donations and volunteers has started to subside, though, these leaders say their organizations must continue to adapt as Arkansans begin the lengthy, often exhausting process of rebuilding in the wake of a major disaster. For some of the people who were affected by the two EF3 tornadoes that swept through Pulaski and Cross counties on March 31, such efforts could take months or years. Some local groups who are providing aid, however, say they are committed to ensuring survivors continue to get support throughout the process, however long it takes. First Baptist Church in Jacksonville was among dozens of religious organizations, nonprofits and government agencies that quickly moved to offer aid to people affected by the tornadoes. Seth Tucker, senior pastor at First Baptist, was out of town when the tornado reached Jacksonville. One of the church's deacons called him to ask if their building could be opened up as a shelter. "The next morning, there's stuff being just left at the church," he said. First Baptist quickly became not only a shelter, but a source for hot meals and needed supplies. Donations began pouring in, along with other offers of help. Within a week, Tucker estimated the church had received at least $75,000 in donations of material goods, with an additional $10,000 in monetary donations. The donations, which ranged from clothing to bedding to hygiene supplies, quickly piled up on tables and along walls. In one room, clothes had even been draped across a piano. "The truth is, we didn't plan any of this," he said. Once the church started to fill up with donations, Tucker said members began writing posts on Facebook that emphasized what continued to be essential, rather than what was no longer needed. By Monday, the number of donations exceeded affected residents' demands. Church leaders stopped requesting donations on social media, and First Baptist has stopped accepting clothing. Tucker said the church plans to donate excess clothes to organizations that are better able to give them away, such as the Care Channel, also in Jacksonville. First Baptist will continue to store and distribute nonperishable food, diapers, hygiene products and other goods likely to remain necessary in the weeks after the tornado, according to the pastor. In Little Rock, similar aid was offered at the Immanuel Baptist Church City Center. Two days after the tornado struck, the site became a family assistance center in partnership with the city and other community organizations, providing food, water and other needed supplies. Officials and representatives were also at the site to address survivors' immediate financial and legal concerns. City officials provided identification for residents who lost theirs to the storm, while the state Division of Workforce Services had set up a trailer in the parking lot with officials supporting survivors with storm-related employment needs. Entergy Arkansas provided power-related assistance, and Federal Emergency Management Agency officials helped with insurance and Small Business Administration loans. By Monday, the City Center had served as many as 5,000 families, said Matt Hubbard, Immanuel Baptist Church's missions pastor and overseer of the site. The center already had an operating food pantry, clothes closet and dental clinic, so its staff already knew how to provide a number of services that are useful in disasters, and how to quickly scale such efforts. "We go from one to one thousand real quick," Hubbard said. Though donations were still coming in, the center had started to slow down its collection, according to the pastor. Like Tucker, the center's overseer acknowledged that clothing donations are often hard to deal with. "A comment we often give to donors is, 'Would you give this to your son or daughter to wear?'" Hubbard said. "We don't want to become a dumpster." The City Center has connected with other aid groups or local businesses to redirect excess items to places where they have a better chance of being used. Hubbard said that approach "still appreciates the donor" without interfering with the center's more critical operations. While the site continues to give away a lot of clothes, diapers and food, they shifted their donation collection to focus on what people who came to the center for aid said was most useful, such as baby formula and batteries. "We had to put ourselves in a position to say 'no' to what might be good but isn't best," Hubbard said. Even as some of the volunteers helping with supplies had been taking on similar efforts for 30 years, the City Center has had to learn about some of the residents' most critical needs "on the fly," Hubbard said. For instance, batteries were important for the thousands of people whose homes remained without power for days. Battery charging packs quickly became another critical item as they can significantly extend a battery's use. "We've adapted and responded as we've heard from people coming through the line," Hubbard said. Goodwill Industries of Arkansas President Brian Marsh explained that one of the reasons clothing donations can quickly build up is that people who have lost their houses don't immediately need much clothing because they have nowhere to put it. In addition to providing vouchers for those affected by the tornadoes, Goodwill has given transportation and storage support to the city of Little Rock and entities such as Walmart and Amazon that don't have the space to hold large volumes of donated resources. The nonprofit has also been in contact with the American Red Cross of Arkansas and tornado-affected communities across the state, and has been sending its staff to process donations at centers that don't have enough volunteers. While many aid groups accepted donations of material goods in the aftermath of the March 31 tornadoes, the Red Cross has been requesting that people give money. "The main thing we try to get is financial donations," organization spokesman Joe Zydlo said. "That's what really helps in situations like this." That money goes to providing financial assistance to families, setting up shelters and providing other comfort and care, added Josh Egbert, another Red Cross spokesman who was in Little Rock on Monday. "If someone gives us $100, we can get 20 blankets for someone," he said. "We can buy coffee, we can buy cots, we can buy these things that these people need and provide them with financial stability to start their recovery process." Heart of Arkansas United Way has also encouraged financial donations. "Donations of money are more helpful because they allow organizations that are on the ground to respond to the needs that they see on a daily basis," said Mollie Palmer, vice president of communication and engagement at the organization. Palmer said she has seen groups and companies partnered with United Way grapple with excess donations. Kimberly-Clark told them they had donations of wipes and feminine hygiene products. "Our first response to that, knowing the problem," she said, "is finding out if this is useful." Palmer said she thinks people want to do something generous in response to disasters, and they sometimes donate things "that aren't necessarily needed just yet." Furniture, for instance, is of limited immediate use to people whose homes have just been destroyed, according to the vice president. She encouraged people who want to make a material gift to "just ask what it is they might specifically need at the time." SHIFT TO LONG-TERM SUPPORT The City Center in Little Rock is in transition, re-assessing current needs and working to determine what will be needed in the months to come, Hubbard said. While the center will scale back some of its short-term efforts, such as collecting donations of lower priority items, they will also deploy to hard-hit areas to assess what longstanding assistance survivors will likely require. Hubbard said the center will have a better understanding of what those long-term needs will be once its teams connect with affected residents "on an individual level." In Jacksonville, First Baptist is moving from "disaster emergency" status into "recovery" mode. Tucker, the church's pastor, said they had seen a drop off in shelter residences, and that they were working to find permanent opportunities for those who remained without homes. In addition, many of the people who lost material goods have been able to acquire most of their needed food and clothing. Federal Emergency Management Agency representatives also remained in Jacksonville, according to Tucker. "It's organized," he said. "And we're trying to make it something more sustainable." The church has used donated money to get electricians to homes that were no longer connected to power, and to pay deposits for apartments for a couple of families, "and we're going to keep doing that," Tucker said. "That's the kind of thing that I think will last for months and months and months," he said. According to the pastor, these longstanding needs will become the church's emphasis. "This isn't a two-week mission trip," he said. Tucker described a friend who lost his home during Hurricane Harvey, which caused devastating flooding in Texas and Louisiana in 2017. The pastor said he asked his friend what he had needed after the storm, and that the man replied, "Everybody helps early, but when it was month four and I was sitting on a slab where my home used to be, no one was with me. And I needed someone there." The pastor said he wanted his church, and Christians in general, to be there for their cities when no one else is. That initial influx of donations and volunteers in the wake of a disaster, followed by a dip in both as time passes, is common, according to Marsh. "Everybody wants to be first to help," he said, but added that, in the days and weeks after the disaster, people often "get on with their lives." Because survivors' needs change over time, Goodwill began issuing vouchers that affected Arkansans can use to replace belongings lost in the storms when they are in ready to do so. The vouchers, which do not expire, can be redeemed for goods in any Goodwill retail store in the state. "Most people who have been displaced by the tornadoes are in immediate need of food, water and shelter," Marsh said in a release issued Monday. "It may be several days to weeks before they are in need of clothing and other household items. But when they are ready, these vouchers can be used anytime, at any location, for any item." Donations collected by the nonprofit are offsetting the vouchers, ensuring there's an ample supply of both vouchers and product, according to the president. Marsh said his nonprofit has been using vouchers in response to disasters in Arkansas since 2014, when a tornado that cut through Faulkner, Pulaski and White counties destroyed over 3,000 homes and killed 16 people. The Red Cross of Arkansas also emphasized its continued dedication to residents affected by the tornadoes. "[Donations] slowly start to drop off, but we want to remind people that we're going to be here for a while," Egbert said. "We're not going to just pack up and leave." This week, the Red Cross opened recovery centers for survivors, according to a news release from the organization. The centers are located at Calvary Baptist Church in Little Rock; the Bill Harmon Recreation Center in Sherwood; the Jacksonville Community Center and the Assembly of God Church in Wynne. Tornado response donations made to Heart of Arkansas United Way will go to the state's long-term recovery efforts, Palmer said. The money will continue to provide support after insurance companies and FEMA are done with their work, according to Palmer.

        A new website meant to be a "one-stop shop" for Arkansans looking for information about the state's education overhaul is now publicly available, Arkansas' education secretary said Friday. Education Secretary Jacob Oliva introduced the site during an Arkansas Board of Education work session at the state Capitol, during which the board also received an update on work groups that will develop recommendations for the LEARNS Act's rules and policies and discussed plans to update the state testing system. The session came one day after the board met at the Marvell-Elaine School District, during which they took control of the district and directed Oliva to explore entering into a "transformation contract" with a third party to operate the district. Oliva said in February that he anticipated the development of an information dashboard to keep the board and public up to date on LEARNS' implementation. The education secretary said one of the portal's goals is to help people "see how all these puzzle pieces" fit together by providing the information in one place. The mobile-friendly site can be visited at learns.ade.arkansas.gov. While he initially introduced the site, the agency's chief information officer, Arijit Sarkar, walked the board through its specific features. Sarkar said the agency quickly realized the portal needed to be that one-stop solution for not only the present, but for years to come. Included on the site are an overview of LEARNS, "transparency dashboards" with real-time statistics, details on work groups and a breakdown of action items and reports related to the law. The site also includes a section for education-related executive orders. The portal's home page displays the interactive dashboards, which are divided into three categories: enrollment range, school letter and ESSER. Below the dashboards are statistics about students, school districts and staff members. The home page also includes links to the text of Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders' executive order, which laid the groundwork for the education overhaul, and the text of the law itself, Act 237. During his presentation, Sarkar also highlighted the four tabs at the top of the site: The portal's "overview" page describes the goals of the law, and is broken into by the topics that make up the LEARNS acronym: literacy, empowerment, accountability, readiness, networking and safety. Each section of the overview describes the goal related to that topic, as well as the Education Department's commitments in those areas. The "accountability" section, for instance, says the law is intended to "reward good teachers with smart incentives, like higher pay," and that the agency is committed to "launch teacher residencies, waive initial licensing fees for first-time teachers, increase licensing transparency and efficiency and update workforce management provisions." The "executive orders" page provides a link to each of the listed executive orders, as well as summary reports and the ability to download the orders. The "action items" page, which is again organized by the LEARNS acronym, lists action items for each topic, along with due dates and, if the deadline has passed, related reports. The "reports" page also provides quick access to reports based on each of the action items. Board member Adrienne Woods, who expressed interest in how many students opt to private or home schooling under LEARNS, asked whether the portal would ever include information on private and home schoolers. Sarkar answered that the information could be integrated into the dashboard. Information about early education would also be available under the dashboard, Oliva said. However, he added that the transition to migrate that information "is a few months out." Ivy Pfeffer, deputy commissioner for the Education Department, also updated the board on the work groups being created for the purpose of developing recommendations for the overhaul's rules and policies. The agency received about 1,300 applications, with about 1,000 individuals submitting applications. According to Pfeffer, about 300 of the submissions were duplicate applications that may have come from people who applied for more than one group. The work groups will be divided by specific topics: school safety; early learning; parental empowerment; teaching and learning; educator workforce and career readiness, according to an earlier memo from the agency. The agency hopes to have work groups of about 10 people each, Pfeffer said. Stacy Smith, who is also a state deputy education commissioner, said that some topics, such as teaching and learning, will probably have several work groups formed "underneath that individual umbrella." Pfeffer said she anticipates the first work groups will be announced and get going in May. The workforce and parental empowerment groups are likely to be among the first to begin, according to the deputy commissioner. The rest of the groups will probably be formed during the summer, she said. Experts from different areas of education will likely be involved in the work groups as well, according to Pfeffer. She also said that education cooperatives are also being encouraged to create similar work groups to review the implementation process, as some aspects of LEARNS won't get underway until the 2025-26 school year. "This is something that's going to be ongoing for some time," she said. During the work session, Oliva also described the agency's efforts to revise the state's standards and the assessments used to measure how well these standards are met. "With the new standards we're writing out a new blueprint," Oliva said, adding that the blueprint would be shared with districts. Oliva highlighted a new state testing system for grades three through 10 that will replace the ACT Aspire in the 2023-24 school year, which will be developed by Cambium Assessment Incorporated, or CAI. CAI was selected from among six companies that responded to a request for proposals to help in developing the state-required tests in literacy, math and science. The Cambium choice was announced by Smith and Hope Worsham, state director for Elementary and Secondary Education Emergency Relief, in February 2022. The online Aspire tests are being discontinued after the 2022 and 2023 spring testing seasons by the ACT, which produces the college entrance exam. "Cambium is the vendor, but this is really going to be Arkansas having a say in their investment and customization for us," Smith said during the 2022 announcement. "The vendor has a lot of assessment questions that are aligned [to Arkansas academic content standards] but we really made it clear in the RFP -- because we really listened to teachers who said they wanted a say and 'we want to make sure the alignment pieces are there.'" During Friday's work session, Oliva said the Cambium-based assessment will ensure teachers have access to "real-time information" with which to make decisions about students' education, which he described as a priority for the agency.

         Three finalists presented their sculpture prototypes at the Clinton Presidential Center on Friday to have the chance to permanently take the place of a sapling from Anne Frank's chestnut tree that was dedicated in her memory in 2015 at the center. Because of Arkansas' climate, the tree did not survive. The selected sculpture will be centered around five 10-foot-tall etched glass panels. One is dedicated to Frank, one contains excerpts from President Bill Clinton's second inaugural address and the rest convey messages from three other violent, discriminatory acts -- the Indian Removal Act of 1830, the Central High crisis and the internment of Japanese Americans in Arkansas during World War II. The Sculpture at the River Market committee, the Clinton Foundation and the Sisterhood of the congregation of B'nai Israel will fund the artist's work and installation at an undecided location at the William J. Clinton Library and Museum. Stephanie Streett, executive director for the foundation, said this gives them an opportunity to have something physical that folks can see. "It also gives us a platform to bring in speakers to have dialogue, public conversations, student conversations; it's been really amazing and we've continued to do that even without the tree," she said. Donors for previous sculpture installations through the Sculpture at the River Market committee and other Little Rock community members visited with the artists and voted on which sculpture they thought should be selected. The winner will be announced this morning. Finalist Clay Enoch, a sculptor from Memphis, created a prototype titled "Indefatigable," which shows a couple bracing themselves for the impact of "catastrophic hatred and oppression." He said the pose "just kept grabbing me, something about the interaction between the couple, the expression, the emotion that it captures." "I hope it would bring someone in to think through some things but also if you're with someone, maybe it inspires a conversation," he added. "I think that's one of the things missing from our culture right now; there's not enough dialogue. Usually, we find out that we're more similar than different. If you really take the time to get to know someone and hear their story, instead of just kind of throwing bombs from social media, from behind a screen." Finalist Tim Smith, an artist from Kentucky, said he was inspired by his daughter's handwriting practice for his sculpture submission. "My daughter used to write cursive, to pretend, because she wasn't old enough yet. She was like 5 years old, but she was competing with her older brother, and she would tell herself stories," he said. "I was always intrigued, so I did a Sarah series that deals with this sort of gestural mark, and that's what I wanted to capture here. It's like you're sketching a tree in two seconds." Smith said his prototype sculpture represents seasonal changes, both outside and inside. The green twisting base of the sculpture winds through rectangular panels and is titled "A Space Within." Smith said he had been asking around what people thought of his design and a few said it shows hope. "I wanted that, but I hadn't expected them to say something like that," he added. "It is this idea of change and transform -- and part of me, what got me thinking about this is, I realized, I'm a classic white guy -- how can you compare with the legitimacy of their concerns?" Smith said the tree itself has a symbolic association with Anne Frank, but where it started was rocks, "under a mountainside, the sedimentary layers." "That shows the creation of the earth, those seeds of change, were fluid -- I've always been intrigued with this idea that what we think is permanent is really something in transition, and in the innocence of transformation to become -- it was so profound to those communities that were affected." Smith said it's about an "internal and external struggle" and how we respond. Finalist Joan Benefiel, a sculptor from Wichita, Kan., said this project is personal to her because her husband is Jewish. Her unnamed piece centers a "violently broken off" chestnut tree branch inside the five panels to symbolize the Holocaust with the top stemming branches blooming in silver. The sculpture would tower over a circular bench that is broken off for an entrance and fits a symbolic Jewish star of David and an American star inside. Benefiel said she wanted a way to incorporate the chestnut tree without it being a full tree because she thought it was important that the sculpture alludes to the fact that Little Rock received one of the 11 saplings from the original tree outside Frank's annex. "It's not hopeless, it's not dead, so it's sort of this unlikely discovery that it's still blooming, it has new life coming from it," she added. "That's the thing that most people associate Anne Frank is, is the hope that she maintained through that most dire, horrifying, [experience] for two years." Inscribed on the tree is a quote from Frank: "What is done cannot be undone, but one can prevent it from happening again." "It was very clear to me in this call, that it was important to acknowledge what's happened, but not just be done with saying, 'Well, we can still hope it doesn't happen again.' That's not good enough," Benefiel said. "You want to be actively working on making sure it doesn't happen again." Benefiel added that she wanted to create something that would be a learning tool and a place for people of all ages to discover something from. "What I really hope, it's a welcoming place, number one, it draws people in, it's of a scale that I think works in this outside environment," Benefiel said. "But what I hope will happen is someone comes in to read the text on the arc there and while they're there, you're reading that text, you're touching it, you're interacting with it, and then you look up at this bright new silver part, thinking about what that means. And what you're doing in that moment is you're standing and doing exactly what Anne did in her attic through her window." Benefiel believes this will spark empathy in visitors and allow them to talk about what that empathy means.  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        Honor Flight of the Ozarks has extended its reach into Arkansas to give more veterans a chance to see the memorials built in their honor in the nation's capital. Thirteen Arkansas counties -- Benton, Washington, Carroll, Madison, Newton, Boone, Marion, Searcy, Baxter, Stone, Fulton, Izard and Sharp -- were added to the Ozarks hub as were Oregon and Shannon counties in Missouri, according to a March news release from Honor Flight of the Ozarks. Honor Flight Network, a national organization, expanded the territory of Honor Flight of the Ozarks, according to the release. The hub previously had covered all of southwest Missouri, said Gary Ellison, a volunteer for Honor Flights of the Ozarks. "We believe there are a whole lot of veterans from Northwest Arkansas who have not gone on an Honor Flight," Ellison said. Jeff Miller and Earl Morse created the Honor Flight Network in 2005 with the simple mission of honoring the nation's veterans by bringing them to Washington, D.C., to visit the memorials built to commemorate their service and sacrifice. While initially focused on America's World War II veterans, Honor Flight Network has expanded its mission to include those who served during the Korean and Vietnam wars and veterans of any service era who are critically ill, according to the website honorflight.org. According to U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs statistics, 167,284 of the 16 million Americans who served in World War II were alive in 2022. Each Honor Flight takes a veteran and guardian on a daylong trip to Washington, D.C., to see the World War II Memorial, the Korean War Memorial, the Vietnam Memorial, the Lincoln Memorial, the Air Force Memorial, the Marine Corps Memorial and the Changing of the Guard at Arlington National Cemetery, according to the release. The Honor Flight Network is a national nonprofit organization composed of independent hubs that work together to achieve the Honor Flight mission, according to honorflight.org. The 124 hubs serve 44 states and have transported more than 260,000 veterans since the program started, according to the website. "It's a wonderful program that gives our veterans the chance to experience our nation's monuments that were erected in their honor," said Patrick Robinson, Benton County Veteran Services director. "Some of the veterans may have never experienced these monuments and would never have the opportunity without the Honor Flight program. "It also offers the camaraderie to travel and experience these monuments with fellow veterans that can relate to their military experiences. I've spoken with several veterans that have taken an Honor Flight. It's easy to tell that the experience is a very positive and emotional experience for the veterans." Ben Dykes, veteran services director for Washington County, said there are about 23,000 veterans in Benton County and 20,000 veterans in Washington County -- the second and third largest numbers in the state. Pulaski County has about 30,000 veterans, he said. Honor Flight of the Ozarks has taken more than 1,700 veterans to the nation's capital, Ellison said. It costs Honor Flight of the Ozarks $82,000 to rent a plane for each trip. Four charter buses are needed when in Washington, D.C. Eighty-one veterans go in each trip, he said. The group gets no government funding and uses fundraisers and donations to pay for the trips, he said. It's a long day as each group meets at the Springfield-Branson National Airport around 5:30 a.m. and returns to the airport around 10 p.m., Ellison said. Honor Flight of the Ozarks, which began operating in 2014, took three flights to Washington, D.C., last year after being grounded because of covid-19 in 2020 and 2021, Ellison said. The first flight for Honor Flight of the Ozarks set for May 17 is full, Ellison said. Other trips scheduled in August and September are mostly filled out, he said. There are vacancies for next year, and eligible veterans are urged to fill out an application, he said. Applications can be found online at www.HonorFlightoftheOzarks.org, according to the release.

        SPRINGDALE -- No injuries were reported when a Springdale school bus carrying children was involved in an accident on Sonora Road early Friday morning. Deputies responded to 20199 Sonora Road at 7:56 a.m. on a report of a school bus accident, according to information from the Washington County Sheriff's Office. Kelly Cantrell, spokesperson for the Sheriff's Office, said a Springdale school bus and one other vehicle were involved in the accident. Cantrell said there were children on the bus, but no injuries were reported. Trent Jones, director of communications for the Springdale School District, confirmed the information from the Sheriff's Office. Jones said a vehicle struck the school bus on Sonora Road, which runs in front of Sonora Elementary School, before the students were dropped off. "Once the police released the scene, the kids were delivered to school," Jones said.

         FAYETTEVILLE -- As the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville prepares to embark upon a national search for the next dean of the Sam M. Walton College of Business, the university has named an interim leader from within the college. Brent Williams will serve as interim dean starting Aug. 14, the same date current Dean Matthew Waller set for himself to step down and return to a faculty position as a professor of supply chain management. Waller, who took over as dean in the spring of 2016 after serving as interim dean since 2015, announced his plans early last month. The university announced the appointment of Williams on Friday. Williams, who received his Ph.D. in business administration -- with a concentration in supply chain management -- from UA-Fayetteville, is currently senior associate dean and Garrison Endowed Chair in Supply Chain Management in the Walton College, overseeing the business school's academic departments, student success initiatives and insights and analytics function, as well as leading Walton College's strategic planning process and several strategic initiatives, according to the university. He has chaired the department of supply chain management and led the early development of the McMillon Innovation Studio and Walton College in Little Rock. "I am energized by the opportunity to serve as interim dean," Williams said in a news release from the university. "I am grateful to Provost Terry Martin for his confidence in me and to Dean Matt Waller for his mentorship and support." Martin appointed Williams to the interim dean position and said in the news release that he's confident Williams "will continue the great work" Waller has started, "as well as continue to position Walton College as one of the best business schools in the country." In recent years, the Walton College of Business has received plaudits from U.S. News and World Report, including being named one of the "Best Business Schools" and having one of the "Best Undergraduate Business Programs," according to the university. Gartner Inc., cited the college for having the country's top undergraduate program in supply chain management in 2020 and 2022. In addition, The Princeton Review credited the university for having one of the top graduate entrepreneurship programs in the country this year, its first appearance in those rankings. It was ranked 35th among the 50 schools listed in the rankings, co-published in November by The Princeton Review and Entrepreneur magazine, and number five in the South region. Under Waller's leadership, Walton College has developed seven new master programs, established myriad endowments, and created four new online bachelor's degree programs. It's also led the way in the university's recent enrollment uptick, as it's up 600 students -- a far larger increase than any other school -- this year, to 2,417 students, according to Suzanne McCray, vice provost for enrollment and dean of admissions. Williams, who has also been on the faculty at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth and Auburn University in Alabama, has led research on how retail supply chains can develop and redesign planning and execution processes to meet the demands of today's changing marketplace, according to the university. He's also published more than 30 articles in several leading business journals. "I am incredibly proud of the accomplishments and growth we have achieved together at Walton College during my tenure as dean, [and] as I transition back to the faculty, I am confident that (Williams) will excel in his new role as interim dean," Waller said in the university's news release. "His extensive experience, dedication, and innovative spirit make him the ideal candidate to lead Walton College into the future, [and] I look forward to witnessing the continued success of our institution under his capable leadership."

        A 47-year-old Little Rock man linked to a 2017 home invasion where two people were shot and the fatal attempted ambush of an off-duty police officer one month later accepted a 25-year no-parole sentence on Friday. In exchange for the 25-year term imposed by Circuit Judge Karen Whatley, Kevin Lamont Pitts pleaded guilty to manslaughter, aggravated robbery, aggravated residential burglary, committing a terroristic act, two counts of first-degree battery and three counts of aggravated robbery for the two attacks about 2½ years apart. One of the links is the gun, deputy prosecutor Scott Duncan told the judge. Duncan said the same weapon was used in the January 2017 home-invasion robbery on Shadybrook Drive where husband and wife Latoria and Kwesi Montaque were shot that was used in the February 2017 robbery attempt on North Rodney Parham Road where Gregory Childers was killed trying to rob an off-duty Little Rock officer transporting state revenue funds. Duncan said Pitts, represented by attorneys Leslie Borgognoni and Camille Wright, could not qualify for parole as the result of a 1996 conviction for aggravated robbery, which means Pitts will not be eligible for early release until he is 68, given credit for time served since his arrest in July 2019. The 1996 case involved Pitts' participation at age 19 in the October 1995 armed holdup of a Little Rock convenience store on Cantrell Road that drew him a 12-year sentence. His co-defendant was sentenced to 10 years. According to police, the Montaque home was the subject of a pre-dawn raid that began when Latoria Montaque was accosted by a gunman when she was starting her car. When she started to go back inside, Montaque heard someone yell her name and when she turned back she saw a stranger rushing towards her, just as she was shot in the left hand. Montaque ran inside and locked the front door, screaming for her sleeping husband, Kwesi Montaque, as she heard glass breaking and more gunshots. The shooter broke out a window to get inside the house while Latoria Montaque climbed out a bathroom window to escape the home and ran to a neighbor's house to call for help. Kwesi Montaque, awakened by his wife's screams and gunshots, found an armed man in the living room. The robber demanded his money, guns, car keys and any drugs in the house. Kwesi Montaque said he was trying to give the robber what he wanted but that when the assailant turned away from him he went for the robber's gun. In the ensuing struggle, the .45-caliber pistol fired several times, wounding Montaque in the right shoulder. The robber got his gun back and left with Montaque's keys, wallet and cellphone, taking Latoria Montaque's 2012 Lexus with him. Investigators found the car about 11 hours later on Cobb Street with Pitts' blood on the steering wheel. His blood was also found at the couple's home on the broken window that the intruder used to get inside the house. About a month later and 6 miles from the Shadybrook home, a shirt covered in Pitts' blood was found in the passenger seat of a stolen sport utility vehicle that 44-year-old Gregory Lamont Childress had used to launch an attack on Angela Everett, an off-duty police detective who was transporting state monies while in uniform from the state revenue office in the Ashley Square shopping center to a bank. She was walking to her unmarked police car with the money when a Chevrolet Tahoe raced up, suddenly stopping to release a masked gunman. The robber demanded Everett give up the money, leading to a shootout that killed the robber, who turned out to be Childress. He had fired his .45-caliber pistol six times during the exchange of gunfire. The sports utility vehicle raced down Reservoir Road, with police finding the Tahoe abandoned about a half-mile away with the bloody shirt inside. Pitts was already a robbery suspect so detectives had him under surveillance with a tracker device on his car, and that tracker showed that his vehicle had been across the street from the shopping center and then in the center parking lot at the same time as the attack on Everett. Childress was on parole at the time from a 40-year-prison sentence for aggravated robbery he received at trial in September 1997 at age 25. He and his older brother, Jeff Childress Jr., had participated in the January 1995 carjacking of a Little Rock man on South Oak Street. The brothers were arrested 30 minutes later. Jeff Childress pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of robbery and was sentenced to five years of probation. Gregory Childress had been in trouble before that, court records show. In August 1990, an 18-year-old Childress and Malcolm Eugene Hodges, also 18, were involved in firing a sawed-off shotgun from their car through the windshield of a second vehicle, with the broken glass injuring a 4-year-old girl. Both teenagers received probation after pleading guilty to second-degree battery and aggravated assault a couple of months later. A 16-year-old boy was also charged but his record has been expunged. In May 1993, Childress' brother, 17-year-old Durrell Ray Childress, shot and killed an off-duty Little Rock police officer, 62-year-old Henry Callanan, while trying to rob Callanan at a McDonald's on West Roosevelt Road. Callanan was taking the restaurant's cash to the bank. Durrell Childress was convicted of capital murder and aggravated robbery, receiving a life sentence from a Pulaski County jury the next year. In September 2020, Durrell Childress' sentence was converted to a 20-year prison term after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that barred no-parole life sentences for juvenile offenders. The reduced sentence made Childress immediately eligible for release.  Print Headline: Man gets 25-year term for two 17 shootings Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         Dear Mahatma: A whole bunch of people are moving here from California. Did you know that? They sell their houses for a lot of money there, and buy in Arkansas for a lot less. Ask anyone in real estate. -- Anecdotal Evidence Dear Anecdotal: Way back when, in a previous century, this newspaper would use cost of living data to persuade journalists to leave their squalid coastal cities and come to beautiful Arkansas. The data was compelling to many. Not to mention all the trees, mountains, lakes, streams and other wonders we have in the Natural State. It's tough to go back to Philadelphia after a visit to the Buffalo River or Petit Jean State Park. What does this have to do with traffic, or driving, or highway construction? Ha! We asked the Department Finance and Administration, of which the Office of Driver Services handles driver's license transfers, for data from 2022. We learned that a total of 53,519 people transferred their licenses from other states to Arkansas. A breakdown of the top 10 transfers turned out this way: 1. Texas: 9,441. 2. California: 5,234. 3. Oklahoma: 3,305. 4. Florida: 2,840. 5. Tennessee: 2,427. 6. Louisiana: 2,265. 7. Colorado: 1,953. 8. Arizona: 1,773. 9. Illinois: 1,698. 10. Mississippi: 1,446. Way lower on the list was Rhode Island, with 39 transfers, a mere 25 from the District of Columbia, 210 from Alaska and 144 from Hawaii. Please allow us to analyze (that is, speculate wildly and without corroborating information) these numbers. We deduce that of course our neighboring states of Texas, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Louisiana would account for many transfers. So many from Texas -- we reckon there are an equal or much greater number of Arkansans moving to Texas. This trend has persisted since the early 19th century, when Arkansans and people from other states would carve into their doors and fences the letters GTT -- Gone to Texas. But California? Not exactly a neighboring state. Light is shed by data from the Missouri Economic Research and Information Center, which tells us that Arkansas is the 11th-cheapest state in which to live, with a composite score of 90.6, 100 being average. Mississippi, the cheapest, is at 85.0. California checks in at 49th, at 137.6. What goes around comes around. The Dust Bowl and Great Depression saw a wave of migration from Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri and other states to California. These poor folks, no matter from which state, were generally known as Okies and Arkies. Have the prodigals returned? Dear Mahatma: For your expired hall of fame license plates. Seen at Walmart on Arkansas 10. -- Robert Dear Robert: Thanks for sending the photo of a Honda with a temporary plate dated June 23, 2021, about 10 dog years ago. Continued use of this plate suggests the driver hasn't paid his 6.5% state sales tax on the vehicle. Although the vast, vast majority of others have.

        100 years ago April 15, 1923 PINE BLUFF — The Lincoln County Bank of Star City filed suit in Chancery Court here today, against K. L. Fish and E. C. Norton, formerly cashier and assistant cashier respectively of the bank, for the recovery of $16,992.50, which according to the complaint, the defendants wrongfully withdrew and appropriated to their own use. It is charged that the money was taken from the bank while the defendants were cashier and assistant cashier, and its withdrawal concealed from the directors of the bank. … The discrepancy was not discovered by the directors of the bank until the latter part of 1922. 50 years ago April 15, 1973 BENTONVILLE — Two escapees from a Muskogee, Okla., jail were captured by State Police near here Saturday night, but a third escapee remained at large. A State Police spokesman said Trooper Keith Ferguson apprehended the two after a high speed chase on U.S. Highway 71 north of here, in which several shots were fired at the troopers car. … Washington County police also suspect two of the escapees robbed a grocery near Fayetteville earlier Saturday, taking $1,000 from the store and four customers. 25 years ago April 15, 1998 Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., sidestepping a class-action lawsuit, must offer free trials of such services as Caller ID to 6 million customers in Arkansas and four other states. The trials are part of a settlement of a lawsuit filed in St. Louis by a group of customers who alleged that Southwestern Bell misrepresented its In-Line and InLine Plus home and business telephone repair services to customers. Although Southwestern Bell agreed to the settlement, approved Dec. 3, the company did not admit to any wrongdoing, said Michael Slatin, a company spokesman. The states involved are Arkansas, Missouri, Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas. … The proposed settlement will give current and former customers of Southwestern Bell Wireless Inc. and its sister company, Cellular One, $15 credit vouchers that can be applied to merchandise at the companies retail stores. The vouchers can also be used for new or renewal service contracts, or additional service. 10 years ago April 15, 2013 A bill approved Wednesday by the Arkansas Legislature will open the door for the General Education Development test, which has long been paid for by the state, to cost students as much as $120. Act 1063, which was introduced March 11 as House Bill 2201, grants the Department of Career Education the authority to determine fees for the test, which must then be approved by the State Board of Career Education. Though the department has paid the existing $20.46 cost of the test, the act allows the department to charge students the higher cost of the GED Testing Services examination beginning Jan. 1, 2014, when the nationwide program is scheduled to shift from pencil-and-paper format to computer-based system.

         FAYETTEVILLE -- Graffiti becomes street art when the property owner welcomes it. Fayetteville hopes to encourage street artists by setting up a sanctioned surface for spray paint art at a defunct pump station already prone to graffiti. A community art wall is planned on Poplar Street southeast of the intersection with Chestnut Avenue, near the Razorback Greenway. The spot is a grassy piece of city right of way on which a decommissioned wastewater pumping station sits. The idea came after City Council member Teresa Turk proposed starting a graffiti abatement program in December. The proposal has undergone some revisions after discussion among council members and members of the city's resident-led Arts Council. The proposal has appeared on the City Council's agenda four times and will again be on the agenda for Tuesday's meeting. The Arts Council suggested providing a sanctioned space for street artists to express themselves as an alternative to painting surfaces illegally. Joanna Bell, the city's arts and culture director, set about finding a suitable place. The plan is to try a six-month pilot program, likely in place by fall, she said. The Arts Council approved using $10,000 out of the city's arts and culture budget to put toward the project. The budget may increase depending on whether the city receives grants for programming, Bell said. If awarded, the City Council would have to approve the grant amount to receive the money. Artists would be able to paint the pump structure itself, along with a couple temporary walls on stilts, Bell said. The walls would be on stilts because the grass sits in a floodplain, she said. The site would go largely self-regulated, Bell said. A sign would outline codes of conduct such as not leaving spray paint cans or litter behind, only painting the sanctioned surfaces and refraining from painting hate speech, she said. "Our hope is that we encourage creative expression in a way that's a little more out in the open and a little more vibrant and results in something that feels a little more welcoming," Bell said. Potential programming may include trucks serving some kind of food or refreshments from a gravel driveway at the site or workshops led by local artists. It can be difficult for aspiring artists to learn how to make public art, said Olivia Trimble, a local artist with a background in sign painting who is frequently commissioned for public art pieces. The best way to learn is through experience and having guidance along the way can be immensely helpful, she said. The region lacks formal training in public art, so any workshops the city could host at the space would go a long way in helping artists hone their skills, Trimble said. Providing a sanctioned space for street artists to practice their craft likely would cut down on the amount of graffiti illegally placed on public or private property by providing an outlet for expression, she said. Communities in other cities typically do a good job of controlling their own sanctioned art spaces, Trimble said. If someone paints something that people may find offensive, local artists usually quickly go to work to paint something else over it, she said. "I just think it will go toward giving more depth and dimension to our arts community, which is rapidly growing and changing," Trimble said. "We want those more interesting, deeper, sometimes complicated components." Sanctioned spaces for graffiti-style artwork are commonplace in the United States and elsewhere. Matador Network, a travel and tourism destination website, lists a few. The Plaza District in Oklahoma City turned a once crime-addled alley into a place for rotating artists to show their work, according to Matador. Different artists paint walls near 16th Street and Indiana Avenue on a monthly basis, giving visitors a reason to come back regularly. The Deep Ellum arts district in Dallas has turned more than 8,000 square feet of wall into artwork for passersby to enjoy. The 42 murals project there in 2012 had local artists paint more walls in the district, which serves as home to live music venues, shops and restaurants. Atlanta has several sanctioned spaces for street art throughout the city. The BeltLine Eastside Trail is particularly known for its dozen or so pieces along a pedestrian-only pathway. The continually changing walls serve as a frequent attraction for visitors, according to Matador. Fayetteville's project aligns with the gathering and place-making goals set out in the city's newly adopted parks and recreation master plan, said Alison Jumper, the city's director of parks, natural resources and cultural affairs. Participants in surveys that helped shape the plan ranked creating places with focused activities highly among priorities for parks, she said. The project also touches on some other goals in the plan, such as taking advantage of under-used city-owned spaces and treating trails as a sort of linear park, Jumper said. "It kind of creates this node where people can hang out, spend time together, enjoy art, participate in art and also have more of a respite along the trail," she said. Sonia Harvey, a member of the City Council and the Arts Council, said she remembered talking about the possibility of creating a sanctioned community art wall when the city developed its Fayetteville Forward economic plan in 2009. The idea seems like a no-brainer for the city, she said. Harvey said she thought of the project like an outdoor art gallery. She said she hopes the project will encourage street artists who otherwise may operate under cover of darkness to come out and show off their skills in a way that benefits the community. "For the people who have a true talent for this type of art form, we'll be able to see who they are, what they do and what they're capable of doing, and say, 'Yeah, knock yourselves out. Go do something amazing,'" Harvey said. [https://bit.ly/matadorstreetart]  Print Headline: Sanctioned street art considered again Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         Two people were killed in wrecks on Arkansas roads Thursday afternoon and Friday morning, according to preliminary fatality reports from the Arkansas State Police. An unidentified man was killed in a single-vehicle crash at 4:46 p.m. Thursday on Arkansas 365 north of Hensley after the 1997 Chevrolet pickup he was driving left the road and struck a tree, causing it to catch fire and burn, according to a report. Michael Wiggins, 62, of Knoxville died in a crash about 8:45 a.m. Friday on Arkansas 27 near Mount Ida when the 2015 Volvo he was driving left the road, overturning and landing on its passenger side, according to a report. State troopers investigating each crash reported that the weather was clear and the road was dry at the time.

        The city of Little Rock will waive all permitting fees in areas affected by the March 31 tornado that hit the metro area, Little Rock Planning and Development Director Jamie Collins announced at a City Hall news conference Friday. Officials have designated a zone of eligibility for waived fees that contains the tornados path, along with a half-mile buffer around it, Collins said. Additional staff have been assigned “as needed” for permitting and inspections, he said.  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        A Saline County man convicted last year of heading up a cocaine distribution conspiracy in Central Arkansas was sentenced to 35 years in federal prison this week. On Thursday afternoon, U.S. District Judge Brian Miller sentenced OC Rawls, 50, of Benton, to 420 months' imprisonment. Rawls was indicted in late 2019 along with five other people after a five-month investigation conducted by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration utilizing controlled narcotics buys, covert surveillance and wiretaps that prosecutors said implicated Rawls and several other people in cocaine trafficking in Central Arkansas. Investigators began looking into the drug-trafficking activities of Rawls and several others beginning in January of 2019. Using a confidential informant, DEA agents made three controlled purchases of cocaine from Rawls. During the investigation, agents learned that Rawls and other members of his drug trafficking organization were traveling to Houston, Texas, to purchase kilogram quantities of cocaine for redistribution in the central-Arkansas area. In May 2019, agents executed search warrants at Rawls' residence and the residences of several co-conspirators, confiscating cocaine, marijuana, firearms, ammunition, and approximately $19,000 in cash. A federal grand jury handed up an indictment in November 2019 charging Rawls with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and crack cocaine, and three counts of possession with intent to distribute and distribution of cocaine. He was convicted of the charges following a two-day jury trial in July 2022. Four of his co-defendants, including Rawls' brother, Tauji Laewon Rawls, 47, pleaded guilty to charges ranging from felon in possession of a firearm to conspiracy to distribute cocaine and have been sentenced to prison. Tauji Rawls pleaded guilty July 20, 2022, to one count of felon in possession of firearms and was sentenced to time served and three years supervised release last September. Kevion Littlejohn pleaded guilty June 1, 2022, to one count of conspiracy to distribute cocaine and was sentenced last September to 78 months in prison. Shonquelous Burnett pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute cocaine June 4, 2021 and was sentenced to 46 months in prison in October 2021. Kenneth Johnson pleaded guilty October 30, 2020, and was sentenced to 12 months and 1 day in prison in May 2021. A fifth co-defendant, Bobby "Bird" Burks, is missing and considered a fugitive. Rawls has a prior federal criminal conviction for possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute, for which he received 150 months' imprisonment in 2006. Because of the prior conviction Rawls' minimum sentence on the conspiracy count was increased from 10 years to 15 years and the minimum term of supervised release was increased from five years to 10 years. In addition to the 35-year prison sentence, Judge Miller sentenced Rawls to serve ten years of supervised release following imprisonment and to pay a $400 special assessment. Following the hearing, Rawls was remanded back into the custody of U.S. marshals to await transport to prison.

         Toward the end of Thursday's Watson Chapel School District board meeting, Superintendent Tom Wilson announced some good news that wasn't. Wilson said he was informed Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed Senate Bill 355, which would have delayed the requirement for new campuses to add storm shelters to Jan. 1, 2025. Wilson found out after the meeting that wasn't the case, going from excitement to original disappointment when he informed the public earlier in the meeting the unsigned bill would result in an extra expense in the district's high school building project. The district has yet to start constructing a new high school, toward which patrons voted for a 5.7-mill increase to 39.8 last August. Watson Chapel, however, along with other districts in similar positions, have faced rising construction costs, meaning the $23 million set aside from state partnership and local millage funding a 92,500-square foot campus is not enough. The district projects about $39.48 million will be needed to cover the entire project cost due to the inflation in building material costs, a far cry from the $17.25 million the Arkansas Department of Education approved the district (for a then-estimated $23 million campus) in December 2021. In a presentation given Thursday, Wilson broke down funding sources for the $39.48 million: $15 million in state partnership funds $8 million in local millage funding $4 million in second-lien bonds $6 million from the district building fund $6.48 in additional funding for facilities, if approved by the Education Department's facility department by May 1. A storm shelter will cost the district anywhere from $3.5 million to $4 million to house secondary school students and about $8 million to house all the district's students, Wilson estimated. The WCSD could apply for financial assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Wilson said. "We should be able to get in line and get money to build a safe room, and we have to pay 25% of that," Wilson said. "They [FEMA] pay 75. That would be huge for the district." The uncertainty in when construction will begin likely changes the projected opening date for the high school from February 2025 to the following fall. The district hopes to approve a final building plan by May 15 of this year and send those plans to state officials for approval by July 25. DISTRICT PLANS RECONFIGURATION In hopes of starting construction soon, the WCSD released its reconfiguration plan of grade levels, which officials say must be submitted to the Education Department by June 1 for approval. Under the proposed plan: Children in grades K-2 will attend Edgewood Elementary (presently K-1) Children in grades 3-6 will attend Coleman Elementary (presently 4-6) Children in grades 7-8 and pre-kindergarten will attend the L.L. Owen Elementary campus (presently 2-3) And freshmen through seniors will attend Watson Chapel High. L.L. Owen was chosen as a temporary junior high campus because of its proximity to the high school for activities, Wilson said. John Hayden, executive director of support services, said pre-kindergartners will be separated from the junior high students, and added the construction partnership with the ADE requires the district to place freshmen at the high school. That will increase the number of students on that campus to 666, as the school has housed as many as 750 students, Hayden added. MONEY TALK A new salary schedule that reflects the state-mandated increase in minimum teacher salary, regardless of degree attained, to $50,000 was passed during Thursday's board meeting. The Arkansas LEARNS Act, which Governor Sanders championed and signed into law March 8, provides for the increase, as well as a minimum $2,000 bump in each salary of $48,000 or more. The new salaries, which go into effect for the 2023-24 school year, are based on a 190-day teacher contract and does not provide additional funding for those on extended contracts. As a result, the WCSD board voted compensate those teachers by taking $2,000 and dividing it by 190, then multiplying the quotient by the number of days in an extended contract to figure the amount to add to the base salary. Board members voted to table a motion that would have authorized Wilson to reject a change in faculty and staff pay frequency from once per month to twice to next spring. Frankie Hemphill of the Watson Chapel High Personnel Policy Committee suggested to board members for months to consider twice-monthly pay, but Wilson contended that to do so would lead to extra costs for the district, citing consultation. "Personally, I'd rather them table it than to vote it down," Hemphill said. "Although I would have rather them voted for it, to have tabled it is fine for me for next year. What I don't like is that you have some people who don't understand what it's like, as board member [Connie] Compton said, to have a one-paycheck household. They need that every two weeks. I remember what it was like in my younger years when I started teaching. That once-a-month was a killer, but twice a month would have been better." WILDCAT WARRIORS Members of the district's Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps were honored as Wildcat Warriors for April: Jyria Williams placed first in drill competitions in the state and she leads her JROTC company, comprised 95% eighth-graders. MaKayla Earl placed first in the new cadet drill competition in the state and was the top female physical fitness competitor. She is said to always be one of the best platoon sergeants in the school's JROTC. Haywood King has been a Cadet of the Quarter as a Let 1 cadet and was part of the New Cadet Drill Team that won its third state championship in a row. His platoon finished third overall. Destiny Hines has been a Cadet of the Quarter as a Let 2 cadet and was drill commander of the first-place unarmed exhibition drill team in state. Chelsea Grigsby is a member of the unarmed drill team that was second in drill competitions and is said to be one of the best sergeants in the school JROTC. Instructors Darryle Small and Sgt. Jimmy Stocker lead the Watson Chapel JROTC. Small and choral music instructor Janet Johnson were named Employees of the Month. PERSONNEL MOVES The district accepted letters of retirement from custodian Williestine Bates and district nurse Rose Sullivent, as well as resignations from elementary teacher Stephanie Hayslip, nurse Michelle Jefferson and Edgewood Elementary Principal Annette Neely.

        Belinda Hendrix, who has coached three softball teams to National Junior College Athletic Association Division I championships, will launch the Southeast Arkansas College softball program as its first head coach, the Pine Bluff school announced Friday.  Hendrix, 47, is also the second head coach in Southeast Arkansas Colleges nascent athletic history, following athletic director and mens basketball leader Chad Kline. Hendrix coached 17 seasons at Chipola College in Florida, leading the Indians to NJCAA Division I championships in 2007, 2015 and 2019. Six of her teams have won championships in the NJCAA's Region 8, which covers Florida, and shes been Coach of the Year in that region six times. In addition, Hendrix won 10 Florida Panhandle Conference titles and was named Coach of the Year in that league 10 times. “I am honored and excited to join the SEARK family as the womens softball head coach,” Hendrix said in a news release. “I look forward to building a program that reflects the core values of SEARK and developing student-athletes who are successful both on and off the field. Together, we will work towards achieving great things and creating a legacy of excellence.” Hendrix said earlier this week that Chipola is similar to Southeast Arkansas College in terms of size, and that Hendrix recruits players who are “serious” about softball and academics and who have something to prove. Hendrix has a 723-187 career collegiate record, has coached more than 50 NJCAA All-Americans, and has graduated 90% of her student-athletes. She left Chipola for East Tennessee State University in July 2021, but she was fired from that job in November. Hendrix earned an associates degree from Thomas University in Georgia and a bachelor of science degree from Troy University in Alabama. She began her career in the Florida panhandle at Vernon High School in 2001. She was selected over Cecilia Kolesar, assistant coach at the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff. “We are thrilled to have Belinda Hendrix join the SEARK family,” Southeast Arkansas President Steven Bloomberg said. “Her experience and accomplishments speak for themselves, and we believe she will be an exceptional addition to our athletics program. We look forward to seeing the impact she will have on our student-athletes and the SEARK community.” Added Kline: “Belinda Hendrix is an outstanding coach who has achieved numerous milestones in her career. We are confident that she will continue to develop and inspire our student-athletes, as well as elevate the softball program to new heights.” Kline said the college will hold off on announcing its head baseball coach at least until Monday. Georgia Highlands College assistant Tucker Hughes and Steven Adams Jr., Eastern Kentucky University's director of baseball operations, are the finalists for that position.

        Walmart Inc.s chief merchandising officer will leave the company at the end of May, Walmart said Friday. John Furner, president and chief executive of Walmart U.S., said in a memo to employees that Charles Redfield will serve through the end of April but stay on through May in an advisory role. Furner said Redfield will “begin a new chapter in June spending more time with family.” The company will release information about Redfields successor soon, Furner said. Redfield is a 32-year Walmart veteran, but just moved into his current job in January 2022. Starting as a cashier at Sams Club while a student at the University of Arkansas, Redfield was brought on full time after graduating. After serving in a number of leadership roles in operations and merchandising, he was named chief merchandising officer for Asda, Walmarts U.K. subsidiary, in 2010. Redfield returned to the United States in 2012 to serve as executive vice president of merchandising at Sams Club. In 2015, he was named executive vice president of food at Walmart U.S., a role he held until becoming chief merchandising officer in 2022. Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        The city of Little Rock will waive all permitting fees in areas affected by the March 31 tornado that hit the metro area, Little Rock Planning and Development Director Jamie Collins announced at a City Hall news conference Friday. Officials have designated a zone of eligibility for waived fees comprised of the tornado's path, along with a half-mile buffer around it, Collins said. Additional staff have been assigned "as needed" for permitting and inspections, he said.   Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.
