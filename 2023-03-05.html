         FAYETTEVILLE -- Planning commissioners expressed frustration last week when owners of two new housing units near a historic neighborhood requested to use their dwellings as short-term rentals. They rejected both requests. Commissioners said when the city rezoned about an acre on Fletcher Avenue northeast of Dickson Street in December 2020, they envisioned smaller, more attainable homes would be built to potentially provide workforce housing for long-term residents. Ten homes were built -- five two-story townhomes with two units apiece sharing a wall. However, two of the property owners want to use them as short-term rentals most of the year, with a third request pending for the commission's March 13 meeting. That means 30% of the new homes would function essentially as businesses, rather than providing relief to the city's tight housing market, commissioners said. The development is indicative of a larger trend in the city, where out-of-town investors are turning new homes into money-makers instead of places to live, some commissioners said. One commissioner suggested the city put some sort of time restraint on when owners of a new home could turn their dwellings into short-term rentals. The pool of working-class people who want to live in the city is smaller and at a disadvantage financially compared to a much larger group of out-of-town investors who have good credit and an interest in visiting the city occasionally, Commissioner Porter Winston said during Monday's meeting. "It's a David and Goliath situation, and we've got to find some way to level the playing field," he said. "It's just way too out of balance." What's the problem? About 10 neighbors spoke in opposition to the pair of requests for short-term rentals on Fletcher Avenue, saying they felt like victims of a sort of bait-and-switch. Many of those neighbors also opposed the rezoning proposal that enabled the development of the townhomes in 2020. Justin Minkel, who lives northeast of the townhomes, said planning commissioners and City Council members who supported the rezoning at the time pitched the idea as being worth the pain of neighbors because the development would increase the city's affordable housing stock. However, those homes sold at top dollar, and now three of the 10 could become short-term rentals, he said. So far nine of the 10 units have sold at an average price of $465,000, according to Washington County property records. The range has been $370,000 to $530,000. The average cost of a home sold in the city in the first half of last year was $388,208, according to the latest Arvest Skyline Report. The average value of new building permits, a closer reflection of new home cost, was $413,174. "I think we all kind of came to peace with the idea that we're doing this sacrifice, whether we want to or not, for a good reason. We're going to increase housing, we're going to increase workforce housing," Minkel said. "It doesn't feel like that's what's happening." Sterling Hamilton, the developer behind the townhomes, said the project delivered what the city wanted. Homes in the area, many of which lie within the Washington-Willow Historic District to the west, are typically worth more than $1 million. By that measure, the townhomes are comparably affordable, he said. A developer can't help what a property owner does after he buys a home, Hamilton said. The frustration over three of the townhomes potentially becoming short-term rentals indicates the city's severe lack of supply to meet housing demand, he said. In order for developers to build smaller, more attainable housing anywhere near downtown, they typically have to rezone the land first. It can be an arduous process where developers get stuck between what the city says it wants and neighbors who oppose new development, Hamilton said. "If rezonings weren't the standard to get infill, then perhaps we would have enough infill where short-term rentals were a smaller percentage of it," he said. Infill development refers to the practice of building on vacant or underused lots within the core of a city, typically within its downtown. If it were easier for developers to build new homes close to the city's downtown, then maybe short-term rentals wouldn't cause such a problem, Hamilton said. "It's kind of like you're saying that the rezoning is causing it, and I'm saying the restrictive land use is what causes it," he said. There once stood two single-family homes where the townhomes are now. Even if three of the townhomes become short-term rentals, that would leave seven for new homeowners, a net gain of five homes from before, Hamilton said. The two owners who had their requests for short-term rentals denied by the Planning Commission could appeal the decision to the City Council. It would take three council members to sponsor an appeal. Mike Scott of Little Rock is one of the property owners whose request was denied. He said the arguments presented to deny his request didn't make sense. The commission approved six other short-term rental requests Monday for properties likely less valuable than his, he said. If the commission is concerned about taking away from the affordable housing stock, it should have denied all the other requests, Scott said. Scott said he and his wife planned to stay at the residence when they're in town visiting their son, a freshman at the University of Arkansas. The couple was looking for a source of income to supplement the mortgage. Plus, renting the home out long-term would mean they couldn't visit when they want, since long-term leases typically last a year, he said. He saw his purchase as a positive for the city because using the unit as a short-term rental would bring in tourism dollars. "I'm sure there is an affordable housing issue, but that seems to be more because of the zoning aspect, not the short-term rental aspect," Scott said. Trusting the process The City Council adopted regulations for short-term rentals in April 2021. Before that, the rentals were illegal, although hundreds were in operation. City code describes short-term rentals as properties rented out to tenants for fewer than 30 days. The city classifies the rentals as either Type I or II. Type I rentals have a full-time occupant on the premises with a room rented out. Type II rentals have guests most of the year without a full-time occupant. Owners of short-term rentals must get a business license and building safety inspection to operate legally in the city. Type II rental owners have to take the additional step of getting a conditional use permit from the Planning Commission. A maximum of 2% of all dwelling units in the city are allowed to become short-term rentals. However, properties in a zoning district that allows hotels do not count toward the cap. According to an online map, there are 351 Type II rentals registered to operate in the city and 87 Type I rentals, totaling 438. There are 44,706 dwelling units in the city, according to the American Community Survey of the U.S. Census Bureau. A 2% cap results in a maximum 894 short-term rentals allowed. Among the total dwelling units in the city, 40,104 are occupied and 4,602 are vacant, meaning the city has an 11.5% vacancy rate. That's about average nationally, said Scott Bernstein, founder of the Center for Neighborhood Technology, a national organization that advises cities on how to create equitable, sustainable and resilient neighborhoods, according to its website. However, vacant just means a living space is unoccupied. The dwellings may be dilapidated, or in an inconvenient or undesirable location or priced to a point most people can't afford them, he said. Based on the American Community Survey data, the city has far more detached single-family homes than any other housing type, with about two-thirds of households having one or two people living in them, Bernstein said. That means the city's housing stock is not meeting the demand of people seeking smaller homes, he said. "For places, and Fayetteville is one of them, where you could end up with a large fraction of one- to two-person households, do you need homes to be that big? The answer is no, you don't," Bernstein said. "So you're not building housing types that are the right size for the population. I think that may be where the short-term rental thing may be hurting you." The city doesn't have data to know what percentage of housing developments built within the last few years have become short-term rentals, said Jessie Masters, development review manager. However, it does happen. Planning commissioners said Monday they believed most of the short-term rental requests they considered that night likely were new developments. Concerns such as the impact to affordable housing is why the city adopted regulations for short-term rentals and established a process to consider them, Masters said. "We're lucky in Fayetteville that we do have an ordinance that allows us to regulate short-term rentals, and we can take a look at these things," she said. "The conditional use permit process does give the Planning Commission some discretionary decision-making over whether a short-term rental is appropriate. I think you did see that play out at Fletcher." The Planning Commission voted 7-1 to deny the two requests for short-term rentals on Fletcher Avenue. Winston, Joseph Holcomb, Andrew Brink, Mary McGetrick, Matt Johnson, Mary Madden and Jimm Garlock all voted to deny. Chairwoman Sarah Sparkman was the lone dissenter. Quintin Canada was absent Monday. Sparkman said she supported the requests because the City Council has set narrow criteria for considering the appropriateness of short-term rentals, such as parking capacity, concentration of other nearby short-term rentals and any prior zoning or city code violations associated with the property. Both requests met those requirements, she said. Additionally, the City Council has reversed the Planning Commission's denial of past short-term rental requests, and Sparkman said she wanted to follow the council's policy. The city's rules surrounding short-term rentals may not matter soon. A bill sponsored by state Sen. Joshua Bryant, R-Rogers, that would prohibit cities from regulating short-term rentals is making its way through the Legislature. The bill has passed the Senate and is sitting in a House committee. Johnson told his fellow commissioners if the bill becomes law, the frustrations people have about short-term rentals will only become worse. "It'll be incredibly disruptive to our communities," he said.

        FAYETTEVILLE — The Sam M. Walton College of Business, which has grown rapidly under the stewardship of Dean Matthew Waller, will need a new leader later this year, as Waller plans to step down in August. Waller sent a letter notifying faculty and staff within the Walton College on Wednesday of his intent to return to faculty as professor of supply chain management effective Aug. 14, said John Thomas, director of media relations and core communications at UA-Fayetteville. “Reflecting on my eight years in this role — one as interim dean and seven as dean — fills me with immense gratitude.” Waller wrote in his letter. “I am proud of the remarkable progress we have made in establishing a dynamic and creative learning and research environment,”  I am in awe of the tremendous growth of the Walton College of Business, which is a direct result of the hard work and dedication of our students, faculty, and staff.” Provost Terry Martin will gather advice from Walton College faculty, staff, and students regarding the process and timeline for replacing Waller, as well as the process for naming an interim dean, later this spring, Thomas said. Martin said that Waller “has shown exceptional leadership over the past eight years as dean of the Walton College of Business; under his guidance, the college has experienced immense growth and great success. Waller established seven new masters degree programs, named multiple endowments, launched online degree programs, and developed initiatives that encourage innovation and entrepreneurship. Im grateful to [him] for serving the university as dean for nearly a decade, and Im grateful he will continue serving the university as a professor.” Waller took over as dean in the spring of 2016 after serving as interim dean since 2015. He first joined the university as a visiting assistant professor in 1994, becoming a full professor in August 2007, according to the university. He became chair of the Department of Supply Chain Management when it was established in July 2011 and served as interim associate dean for executive education. Chancellor Charles Robinson said he was grateful for Wallers service to the College of Business, “which is stronger than ever thanks to his leadership and the faculty and staff in the college.” “His influence on students, faculty, and staff has helped the Walton College grow to epic proportions, not only driving our university forward, but also supporting the state of Arkansas as a leading force for business education and research,” Robinson added. The School of Business has led the way in the universitys recent enrollment uptick, as its up 600 students — a far larger increase than any other UA school — this year, to 2,417 students, according to Suzanne McCray, vice provost for enrollment and dean of admissions. In recent years, the Walton College of Business has received plaudits from U.S. News and World Report, including being named one of the “Best Business Schools” and having one of the “Best Undergraduate Business Programs,” according to the university. Gartner, Inc., cited the college for having the countrys top undergraduate program in supply chain management in 2020 and 2022. In addition, The Princeton Review credited the university for having one of the top graduate entrepreneurship programs in the country this year, its first appearance in those rankings. It was ranked 35th among the 50 schools listed in the rankings, co-published in November by The Princeton Review and Entrepreneur magazine, and number five in the South region. “The epic group of leaders I work with have been instrumental in the colleges successes, and I am confident that the Walton College of Business will continue to be a leading force in business education and research,” Waller wrote in his letter. “It is a privilege to have been a part of this journey and to help our students achieve their academic and professional goals. I am certain that the college will continue to reach new heights.” Waller has a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration from the University of Missouri and his Master of Science and Ph.D. — both in business — are from Penn State, according to the university. He was a partner and co-founder of Bentonville Associates Ventures in 1996-2002 and chief strategy officer and co-founder of Mecari Technologies in 1998-2002. Waller, 58, co-authored “The Definitive Guide to Inventory Management: Principles and Strategies for the Efficient Flow of Inventory across the Supply Chain.” An academic paper he co-authored on total quality management is one of the most cited in the journal Decision Sciences, according to the university. Waller, the Sam M. Walton Leadership Chair, received the 2020 Distinguished Service Award from the Council of Supply Chain Management and the Whitney M. Young Award from the Urban League of Arkansas for his efforts to improve the lives of underserved Arkansans. He obtained a $10 million endowment for the creation of the William Dillard Department of Accounting, he was recognized as part of Arkansas Business Publishing Groups 250 Most Influential Leaders of 2020 in the State of Arkansas, and he was appointed by then-Gov. Asa Hutchinson to the Governors Transformation Advisory Board to make the organization and processes of state government more efficient and effective, according to the university. Hes on the board of directors of the Winthrop Rockefeller Institute and Private Equity Advisory Board of Natural Capital. Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        Colin Boerger and Jessy Sorrick are the winners of the 2023 Little Rock Marathon, according to the marathons Twitter page.   [Trouble viewing video? Go to https://youtu.be/fd31eSkSKzM] 10:52 a.m. | LITTLE ROCK MARATHON: Executive director Geneva Lamm is all business about the medals Beginning shortly after 11 a.m. Sunday and continuing into the afternoon, finishers of the 21st Little Rock Marathon will trickle across the finish line on La Harpe Boulevard.  Im camped out at the finish line for the @LRMarathon. It sounds like were closing in on a mens winner. Plenty of half-marathoners coming across at the moment. pic.twitter.com/0TfuN0d4PV   Their legs plenty tired after completing the 26.2-mile course, runners will take a couple hundred more steps, following the signs directing them inside the back of the Statehouse Convention Center. The runners will pose for pictures, then go grab a snack to refuel or some more water. Others might go for a celebratory Michelob Ultra -- or two -- before seeking out their friends and family for a hug. But before any of that, each finisher will find a smiling volunteer and bow their head, awaiting one of the hundreds of oversized, sparkly, brightly-colored medals that will be placed around their neck. Since its third edition in 2005, the Little Rock Marathon has awarded those who complete the race with a distinct, intricate prize -- enormous in size while also extravagant in detail. This year's medal is no different, measuring in at more than 8 inches wide and nearly 3 pounds. Inspired by the theme, "Peace, Love, Little Rock Marathon," it features an interlocking peace sign and heart surrounded by symbols associated with the hippie movement such as flowers, doves, music and a van, brought to life with an array of bright, sparkly colors as is tradition for executive director Geneva Lamm. Year after year, Lamm attempts to one-up herself with a unique and elaborate design, ensuring that each runner -- everyone from Searcy native Tia Stone, winner in five of the last seven women's races, to the final finisher -- has something to appropriately commemorate their accomplishment. The idea spawned from a race Lamm ran in southern Texas shortly after beginning her role with the Little Rock Marathon in 2002. Lamm had just finished the marathon and her friend had completed the 5K race. "When we finished, we got the same medal, and I was like, 'Oh, no, no, I did the marathon. I didn't do the 5K,' Lamm recalled. "They're like, 'No, that's the medal for everybody.' " That didn't sit right with Lamm. She believed that everyone should get a medal the size of their individual achievement. So, Lamm set out to make that the case for her race in Little Rock. She sketched out what she wanted of the first medal -- mostly in stick figures -- but quickly discovered that the companies bidding to produce them had a different idea of what it would actually look like. That led Lamm to teach herself how to use the Adobe Creative Suite so she could specifically design the medals on her own. In 2006, she produced a sparkly version of the race's corporate logo, which Lamm calls "The Shield." From there, the medals took on a life of their own, and each year, Lamm tasks herself with designing something one-of-a-kind to fit that race's theme. In 2008, it was "Six in the City" to celebrate the race's sixth edition. In 2012, the theme was disco. The 2015 race was pirate-themed -- perhaps Lamm's favorite to date -- and as is the case each year, Lamm and race organizers encourage runners to dress in costume. But idealizing and designing the medals is one thing. It's another to produce them, especially as the race has grown as large as 10,000 total runners across the different competitions -- marathon, half-marathon, 10K and 5K. Steve Hasty, owner of Hasty Awards in Ottawa, Kan., has worked in conjunction with Lamm on and off for the last 12 years. It's not guaranteed Hasty will be the one chosen to produce the medals each race -- because the Little Rock Marathon is a fundraiser for the City of Little Rock's Parks and Recreation Department, Lamm has to run an annual blind-bidding process to determine who will get the contract for a given year. But Hasty holds a special place in his heart for Little Rock because the medals are such a passion project for Lamm. "There's no question that the Little Rock Marathon is the most fun race," Hasty told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. "[Geneva] is an educated customer, which makes it a lot easier." The bidding typically begins in June, and for an early March race, Hasty likes to begin production no later than September. For the marathon medals, the die-casting process begins by forcing each of the different colors of zinc-based alloy into the molds. Each of the different colors, many with glitter -- a Lamm specialty -- is allowed to dry before Hasty moves on to the next color. All told, creating the Little Rock Marathon medal takes about 50 days. That's before the ribbon is hand-sewn on, all adding up to a cost of $13 per medal and leaving little profit margin for Hasty. The goal is then to have all the medals completed and in Little Rock no later than January. Across the different competitions, that's between 9,000 and 10,000 medals -- almost a 400% increase from the 2,502 that participated in the inaugural race in 2003. Lamm keeps a notepad on her desk at home with ideas for future themes, and she's already thinking about concepts and designs of medals for at least the next five years. After 19 years, it's nothing but "a labor of love." "It's always on my mind," Lamm said. "We're always trying to figure out how to do something better and new. ... The payoff for me and my staff is seeing those people cross the finish line."   Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         With Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders' education overhaul bill nearing the end of its legislative journey, state lawmakers will soon turn their attention to a proposed public safety overhaul package and other projects. Monday will be the 57th day of the 94th General Assembly's regular session. The Arkansas House and Senate have approved a resolution for the chambers to recess starting March 16 and ending March 29 to coincide with the spring breaks of high schools as well as a resolution to extend the regular session beyond 60 days and to recess April 7 or at an earlier date agreed upon by the House and Senate. It would require a three-fourths vote of the 100-member House of Representatives and 35-member Senate to extend the regular session beyond April 7. After factoring in the spring break recess, "we've got four weeks to work," said state Rep. Lane Jean, R-Magnolia, when asked whether there is any way for state lawmakers to wrap up the regular session by April 7. "We have a lot to do, so long weeks, long hours," said Jean, who is a co-chairman of the Joint Budget Committee. "I am not going to be say it can't be done, because it can. But we've got to get on the stick." House Speaker Matthew Shepherd, R-El Dorado, said he's still working toward completing the regular session April 7. "Once the education bill is finished, then I think a lot of these other things are probably going to be a little easier to move forward," he said Thursday. Asked about ending the regular session by April 7, Senate President Pro Tempore Bart Hester, R-Cave Springs, said Thursday that "I think it is becoming more of a challenge every day. "We have to keep a goal or we'll never get to somewhere, but we are probably looking at mid-April at this point just because we pushed real hard on the education bill and we just need to give members time to process through all the things that are important to them," he said. April 7 would be the 89th day of the regular session. The regular session lasted 118 days in 2021 and was 30 days longer than the 88-day regular session in 2019. The regular session lasted 86 days in 2017 and 82 days in 2015. "We're really thinking we'll come back from spring break [and] we'll do constitutional amendments, tax cuts and RSA [the state's Revenue Stabilization Act], but you got to have some idea of RSA before you can do criminal justice," Hester said. The state's Revenue Stabilization Act prioritizes the state's distribution of general revenue of state-supported programs in each fiscal year. Sen. Jonathan Dismang, R-Searcy, a co-chairman of the Joint Budget Committee, said Thursday that "I am waiting on a balanced budget proposal" from Sanders' administration for fiscal 2024, which starts July 1, 2023, and ends June 30, 2024. Asked when the governor is going to present her proposed general revenue budget for fiscal 2024, Sanders spokeswoman Alexa Henning said, "No announcements at this time." In November, then-Gov. Asa Hutchinson proposed a $314 million increase in the state's general revenue budget to $6.33 billion in fiscal 2024, starting July 1, 2023, with $200 million of the increased general revenue earmarked for public schools to help boost teachers' salaries. At that time, the former Republican governor said his proposed budget for fiscal 2024 would represent a 5.2% increase over the current budget of $6.02 billion, leaving a projected general revenue surplus of $254.9 million at the end of fiscal year 2024. Considering inflation was more than 8% last year, limiting the growth of the state's general revenue budget to 5.2% reflects conservative budgeting in these challenging times, he said. EDUCATION REVAMP On Monday after the Senate adjourns, the Senate Education Committee is scheduled to consider the version of Sanders' education overhaul legislation that the House amended. The House on Thursday voted 78-21 to approve Senate Bill 294 by Sen. Breanne Davis, R-Russellville. The legislation is the Republican governor's wide-ranging education overhaul bill that would boost the minimum salary for teachers from $36,000 to $50,000 a year and includes state funds that students could use to attend a private, parochial or home school. Among other things, the legislation would give $2,000 raises for teachers making more than the new proposed minimum teacher salary. Teachers also could receive up to $10,000 in bonuses for high test scores, or teaching in a geographical area or a subject matter in high demand. "It will be on the Senate floor Tuesday and to the governor's desk," Hester said. Asked if there is a date for a bill-signing ceremony for the proposed LEARNS Act, Henning said Saturday that "The Governor will sign the boldest education reform as soon as it passes the Senate [this week]." The Senate's agenda on Monday includes Senate Bill 262 by Sen. John Payton, R-Wilburn, which is aimed at no longer requiring the state Board of Education to administratively consolidate school districts with fewer than 350 students into one or more school districts. The bill cleared the Senate Education Committee on Wednesday. School districts with fewer than 350 students may still voluntarily agree to administratively consolidate with or be annexed to another school district and districts, and the state Board of Education would be required to promptly consider petitions submitted by these school districts under the bill. Under Act 60 of 2004, school districts with fewer than 350 students are required to consolidate. Act 377 of 2015 allows school districts with student enrollment that falls below 350 that are not in financial, academic or facilities distress to apply to the state Board of Education for a waiver to continue to operate independently. Payton said Friday school districts with fewer than 350 students still would be required to meet the state's financial and academic standards under his SB252. He said some rural school districts are worried about the possibility of being consolidated as a result of expanded school choice, and "this [bill] is trying to alleviate those concerns." PUBLIC SAFETY OVERHAUL Rep. Jimmy Gazaway, R-Paragould, said Friday that lawmakers are still discussing the sweeping public safety package, which is expected to cover topics ranging from "parole reform" to prison expansion. "Education just sucked so much oxygen out of the room," he said. "Now I think we can squarely focus on it." But Gazaway said he didn't expect the bill to be filed this week. While he anticipates the filed bill to be longer than the 145-page education bill passed by the House on Thursday, he said technical changes will likely make up a significant portion of the measure. The public safety package is expected to cover legislative proposals from the Arkansas Prosecuting Attorneys Association and the state Department of Corrections, Gazaway said. Other groups, including The Council of State Governments and the American Legislative Exchange Council, also have offered suggestions, said Gazaway. The bill would include "progressive reforms" intended to reduce recidivism rates and increase funding for specialty courts, he said. Gazaway said discussions over prison expansion have contributed to the delay in the bill's filing. "We have to be careful with the budget. We want to be wise stewards of the money we have," he said. "Now that we have some clue as to what the education package is going to cost, now we can have a better idea of what we can afford in terms of public safety." OTHER BILLS The Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday is scheduled to consider Senate Bill 270, which would establish criminal penalties for a person who knowingly remains in a bathroom of the opposite sex while a minor is present. It will be the second time in as many weeks the panel has reviewed the legislation. Payton, the bill's sponsor, pulled the measure from the Senate floor on Wednesday after some lawmakers raised concerns about a drafting error. SB270 would generally criminalize instances where a person 18 or older knowingly "enters into and remains in a public changing facility that is assigned to persons of the opposite sex while knowing a minor of the opposite sex is present in the public changing facility." On Tuesday, the House Judiciary Committee is expected to consider Senate Bill 81, which aims to regulate obscene materials in public libraries, and Senate Bill 199, which would allow civil lawsuits against health professionals who perform "gender transition procedures." They are scheduled for a special order of business on the panel's agenda. Senate Bill 81 by Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Jonesboro, would strike a defense statute from state law protecting public library staff from criminal liability for distributing obscene material. It also aims to standardize the process for challenging the "appropriateness of material" available at public and school libraries. Senate Bill 199 by Sen. Gary Stubblefield, R-Branch, would permit a person who was injured as a minor by a "gender transition procedure" to sue the health professional who performed the procedure. At the top of the agenda for the Senate State Agencies and Governmental Affairs Committee's meeting on Tuesday is Sullivan's amended Senate Bill 71, which is aimed at ending affirmative action programs in state and local government in Arkansas and giving state agencies two years to implement the bill, if it's enacted into law. Under the bill, "The state shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, an individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin in matters of state employment, public education or state procurement," under a section of the bill which states that it would only apply to an action taken after the effective date of the measure. The bill states this section of the bill does not prohibit consideration by the state of bona fide qualifications based on gender that are reasonably necessary to the normal functions of state government, public education or state procurement; invalidate a court order or consent decree that is in force at the effective date of this measure; prohibit an action necessary to establish or maintain eligibility for a federal program if ineligibility would demonstrably result in a loss of federal funds to the state; or preempt state discrimination law or federal discrimination law. Under SB71, a person who negligently violates this section of the bill would be guilty of a Class A misdemeanor. HOMESTEAD PROPERTY TAX CREDIT On Monday, the House is scheduled to consider legislation that would increase the homestead property tax credit from $375 per parcel to $425 per parcel after the measure cleared the House Revenue and Taxation Committee on Thursday. House Bill 1032 by Rep. Lanny Fite, R-Benton, would be effective for assessment years starting on or after Jan. 1, 2023. The homestead property tax credit reduces the amount of real property taxes due on a property owner's qualified homestead for each assessment year, the state Department of Finance and Administration said in a legislative impact statement on HB1032. To claim the credit, a property owner registers with the county assessor and provides proof of eligibility for the credit. The finance department projects that HB1032 will cost $34 million in calendar year 2024 and $34.8 million in calendar year 2025. In the 2000 general election, voters approved Amendment 79 to the Arkansas Constitution to create the homestead property tax credit. In response, the Legislature enacted a half-cent sales tax, effective Jan. 1, 2001, and the revenue is credited to the property tax relief trust fund. The Legislature established the initial homestead property tax credit at $300 per parcel before voting in 2007 to increase it to $350 and then voting in 2019 to increase it to $375. The 2019 law also allows the transfer of excess funds in the property tax relief trust fund to the state's catastrophic reserve fund. TUNNEL TO BIG MAC The Legislative Council's Executive Subcommittee is scheduled to discuss the option of the Bureau of Legislative Research issuing a request for qualifications for architectural and engineering design services for a state Capitol tunnel project, according to the General Assembly's website. The proposed tunnel would be from the state Capitol building to the Multi-Agency Complex, which is commonly known as Big MAC, and security concerns have prompted consideration of the project, said Legislative Council Co-Chairman Rep. Jeff Wardlaw, R-Hermitage. He said the request for qualifications would help determine the cost of the proposed project. As to whether lawmakers, their staff and the general public would be able to use the proposed tunnel, Wardlaw said, "I think that's all to be determined." If the proposed tunnel would be opened to the general public, they would have to go through security at the state Capitol building or at Big MAC, he said. Marty Garrity, director of the Bureau of Legislative Research, said $2 million in state funds has been appropriated annually for the proposed tunnel. In September of 2009, the Legislative Council signed off on a plan with an estimated $1.8 million price tag to construct a pedestrian tunnel between the state Capitol building and Big MAC before the project was scrapped. At that time, then-Democratic Gov. Mike Beebe described the project as unnecessary, citing the state's tight economic times.  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         Thirty years after he first enlisted in the National Guard and after roughly 27 years as part of the Arkansas National Guard, Maj. Gen. Jonathan Stubbs formally became the 54th adjutant general of Arkansas on Saturday. Stubbs took part in an Assumption of Command ceremony held at the Camp Robinson's Professional Education Center. The ceremony was overseen by Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Sanders nominated Stubbs to be the adjutant general in January. "Major general, if there is anyone who understands service and understands sacrifice, it is you," Sanders said to a room filled with a couple hundred dignitaries and service members. "You can look every single member of our National Guard in the eyes and say that you have been in their shoes. You know what they're going through." Sanders said "the quality of our National Guard can be the difference between life and death. ... I know that Maj. Gen. Stubbs is the man to lead our National Guard into the future." Stubbs and his family, including wife Jane, return to Arkansas after he spent two years stationed at the Pentagon in Washington D.C. as deputy director of Operations, Readiness and Mobilization. In an interview before the ceremony, Stubbs called his elevation to adjutant general "a little bit overwhelming" and "incredibly humbling." "To be able to represent this incredible organization as the adjutant general, to represent over 8,400 soldiers and airmen of this storied organization, just humbled, grateful," Stubbs said. "Incredibly excited for the future." "You think about where you started in the organization as a very young officer and now to be selected and appointed as the adjutant general this many years later and everything that happened in between, it's a lot to take in." Stubbs first enlisted in National Guard in October 1993 in Company A, 4-117th Infantry Battalion in Lexington, Tenn., as a private first class. His family had a long history in the armed forces, including his father -- a Methodist preacher -- serving as a National Guard chaplain. "He was the first soldier I ever knew and I grew up just kind of with the idea of serving," Stubbs said. "And I just finally worked up the courage ... going into my senior year of college to join and to do it." While he didn't necessarily envision becoming an adjutant general, he did enlist "with very specific goals to become an officer." Stubbs has spent the last two months getting "reoriented" with the organization he "grew up in." "Doing a lot of listening and just evaluating and just understanding where the organization is, and kind of crafting my vision and my priorities for the future," Stubbs said. In the interview and during the ceremony Stubbs laid out his five priorities: People, recruiting/retention, readiness, relevance/modernization and innovation. As he detailed each, Stubbs occasionally rapped his right fist on a raised table to emphasize his points. "Taking care of people. That's my No. 1 priority," Stubbs said. "It's always gonna be my No. 1 priority. And when I talk to people, I'm talking about soldiers. I'm talking about airmen. I'm talking about their families. I'm talking about all of our civilian employees that we have within the Arkansas National Guard. And I'm also talking about the employers that are out there in our communities that provide their respective employees to our organizations." As far as relevance and modernization, Stubbs was asked if there were any specific facilities he wants to see introduced in Arkansas. "I want to make sure that we're postured to build new readiness centers in our community," Stubbs said. "So we're really excited about the possibility of building a new Army National Guard readiness center in Pulaski County. Stubbs said that center, or armory, would be outside Camp Robinson. "It's all tied to the military construction timeline," Stubbs said. "So within the next, say, five to seven years, we want to get something like that."

         Arkansas is set to join the ranks of West Virginia, Arizona, Utah and Iowa as states that have recently passed universal voucher measures, with Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders' education proposal moving one step closer to passage. Senate Bill 294 easily passed the Arkansas House on Thursday with a 78-to-21 vote and will head to the Senate this week for a vote to concur on the bill's amendment. If approved, which is likely, the bill will be sent to the governor's office to be signed into law. While voucher programs exist in states across the country, including Arkansas, the Republican governor's voucher proposal would eventually be open to every student in Arkansas. Sanders' education plan, commonly referred to as the LEARNS Act, would allow students to use state dollars to help with the cost of attending a private or home school. In January, the Utah and Iowa legislatures passed similar universal school choice laws that would tie state dollars on education to students, allowing them to spend the money at private or charter schools. Arkansas' bill followed a similar effort in Arizona, which passed an expanded voucher program last year. Robert Enlow, president of Ed Choice, a pro-voucher education nonprofit based in Indianapolis, said the school closures during the covid-19 pandemic helped catalyze a renewed national push for what he called a "customization model" in education. With many students sitting at home following along with classroom instruction via Zoom, the experience made parents realize they want more control over their child's education, Enlow said. "I think the pandemic certainly had something to do with that," he said. "It's really not about school choice, it's about educational choice [for families]." Arkansas already has a limited school choice program, the Succeed Scholarship, which offers state funding for students with disabilities or who are in foster care or the children of an active-duty military service member. The LEARNS Act's voucher program, called Educational Freedom Accounts, will be phased in over three years, beginning with the 2023-2024 school years. Students who receive an Educational Freedom Account will receive 90% of the state's per-pupil funding from the previous year. For the 2022-2023 school year, the state's per-pupil funding was $7,413. In the first year of the program, Educational Freedom Accounts will be open to students who are eligible for the Succeed Scholarship, enrolling in kindergarten for the first time, and those attending an F-rated school. In the second year, the program will be open to students enrolled at a D-rated school, and in year three it will be open to all those eligible to enroll in a public school. The Educational Freedom Accounts would cost $46.7 million in the first year, with the state anticipating 7,000 students will enroll in the program in its first year. The cost increases to $97.5 million in the second year with an estimated 14,000 students enrolled in the program, according to a fiscal study by the Arkansas Department of Education. Robert Brech, deputy director of budget at the Department of Finance and Administration, said the program will cost the state an estimated $175 million in the third year. The omnibus bill caps the number of students who can receive an Educational Freedom Account, with 1.5% of the total public school enrollment in its first year, and 3% in its second year. In year three, when the program is open to all students, "there shall be no limitation on student participation in the Arkansas Children's Educational Freedom Account Program," according to the bill. If the number of students applying for vouchers exceeds the amount the state has set aside, the Department of Education will establish rules promulgating which students get priority. The Department of Education's fiscal study did not include projections for how many students would be enrolled in year three of the program when each public school student would be eligible. However, Enlow said enrollment in voucher programs tends to grow exponentially to include 4% to 6% of the state's student age population. Enlow said Ed Choice consulted with Arkansas lawmakers and gubernatorial staff who crafted the LEARNS Act. For the National Education Association, the nation's largest teacher union, Sanders' school choice initiative is not a novel solution to an old problem, but rather a continuing ideological fight over public schools. "This has been proposed in Arkansas, and every time it has been defeated because of the Legislature's support for their rural schools," said Mary Kusler, the association's senior director for advocacy and policy. "We also know that this an ideological goal for many -- for many in the right-wing ... so often we see elected leaders take this on as their big signature item." While some states have approved universal voucher programs in recent years, states such as Idaho and South Dakota have voted down expanded school choice programs. Like Arkansas' bill, Utah's school voucher bill includes raises for teachers. Utah teachers will see a $6,000 salary and benefits bump. Sanders' bill includes a $14,000 increase in the starting salary for teachers, and $2,000 raises for teachers already making more than the proposed $50,000 a year minimum. Kusler said lawmakers included popular proposals such as higher wages for teachers to help make unpopular ideas like vouchers more palatable to voters. "The only way they were able to pass vouchers, or in the process [of passing] in Arkansas, was because they attached it to something that has bipartisan support, [such as] stepping up and supporting our educators," Kusler said.

         A Little Rock public relations executive last year quietly pursued a partnership with a firm that was set to get an airport advertising contract as the deal appeared to be stalled at the Little Rock Municipal Airport Commission while intimating that his involvement could help secure the contract, records show. Myron Jackson is the president and chief executive officer of The Design Group, a public relations and marketing firm based in Little Rock with close ties to Little Rock Mayor Frank Scott Jr. At one point, Jackson left a voicemail for the proposed advertising firm in which he cited the "concerns" of the Airport Commission surrounding the project and suggested that "we can really help each other and kind of solidify this opportunity for your organization as well as for mine." His efforts were unsuccessful in the end. The head of the firm says she did not call Jackson back, and the Airport Commission, in a 4-2 vote, authorized a contract in July 2022 without any designated role for the Design Group. When asked about Jackson's outreach, in a statement provided by a spokesman, airport Executive Director Bryan Malinowski said, "The airport encourages outreach and collaboration before a proposal is submitted to the airport. However, after we receive a submittal, it is inappropriate for third parties to attempt to insert themselves in a proposal in which they were not originally included." Nevertheless, since then Jackson has sought to deepen his involvement with the state's largest airport. On Jan. 4, he submitted an application to be appointed to the Airport Commission, the seven-member panel that oversees Bill and Hillary Clinton National Airport/Adams Field. Members are appointed by the mayor, subject to confirmation by a three-fourths majority of the Little Rock Board of Directors. The city board has yet to confirm someone to the open seat on the commission for which Jackson has applied.   "I am a small business owner, and every day I must actively pursue new relationship opportunities, as any successful business person or salesman would," Jackson said via email in response to written questions from the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. "In this case, I pursued a new business relationship and attempted to leverage my experience as an airport vendor of eight years" -- he later acknowledged the Design Group was a vendor for 10 years, not eight -- "and expertise of the local marketplace. My role was as a vendor of a vendor, and I'd hoped to continue doing work for the airport. I was encouraged by Airport staff to call all the established potential RFP respondents. And that I did; if you call them and ask, there may be records of those calls and/or emails as well." With regard to his application to join the commission, Jackson said he believed that "my past experience as a vendor gives me an advantage as a commission-candidate. Very few current commissioners have that experience." PAYMENTS The previous holder of the advertising concession in Little Rock typically paid the Design Group thousands of dollars per month, records show. For 10 years starting in 2012, the concession to sell in-terminal advertising was held by Clear Channel Airports, the airport-advertising brand of Clear Channel Outdoor. Under the airport's advertising concession with Clear Channel, the Design Group was tapped as a subcontractor because the firm was considered a disadvantaged business enterprise, or DBE. DBEs are defined as "for-profit small business concerns where socially and economically disadvantaged individuals own at least a 51% interest and also control management and daily business operations," according to the U.S. Department of Transportation's website. As a way to encourage fairness for disadvantaged contractors that might otherwise face discrimination on highway, transit or airport projects receiving federal assistance, the Department of Transportation requires recipients of funding to develop a DBE program. The Airport Concession Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (ACDBE) program operates under a separate set of regulations from the general DBE program, but their overall goals are the same. The initial agreement between the airport and Clear Channel signed in April 2012 laid out a goal for the concessionaire to rely on the goods, services or products of DBEs equal to 15% of the dollar value of the agreement. "Clear Channel selected The Design Group as a DBE and managed the relationship, which included payments," airport spokesman Shane Carter wrote in an email. "The goal, which was based on gross revenue, remained at 15% with exception to six months in 2020 when it was decreased to 7.5% due to concerns over declining advertising revenue during the COVID-19 pandemic." Records from Clear Channel show the firm paid the Design Group, or Design Group Marketing, a total of roughly $656,812 between 2012 and 2022. The Design Group was not certified as a DBE in the lead-up to the Airport Commission's deal with Departure Media, according to the Arkansas Department of Transportation. Department official Joanna P. McFadden said the Design Group is not currently certified as a DBE or ACDBE. The firm was previously DBE certified from Nov. 10, 2010, to March 28, 2012, and Sept. 15, 2015, to April 1, 2019, she said via email. According to an April 1, 2019, letter addressed to Jackson from the Arkansas Department of Transportation, the DBE certification of Design Group Marketing, LLC was removed because of a failure to submit an annual affidavit. "The DBE just has to be certified at the time of the contract award," McFadden wrote in response to questions regarding oversight and possible penalties when a subcontractor loses its certification. "The prime contractor is not penalized if the certification is lost during the life of the project." Jackson told the Democrat-Gazette via email that "a DBE certification is at the desire of the business submitting for one. It is unrelated and not needed to do business as an airport vendor. Our firm did not 'lose' the status, we elected to not submit for renewal for business reasons." A five-year contract extension between the airport and Clear Channel was signed in June 2017. But when the end of the latest advertising concession neared, Clear Channel chose not to bid. After some earlier dialogue with Clear Channel about a contract, records show that Jackson in January 2022 sent a revised "teaming agreement" to a Clear Channel Airports official. Language in the draft agreement suggested Clear Channel would submit a proposal for an extension of the airport advertising concession in Little Rock with the Design Group as a proposed subcontractor. Among other things, the agreement would change the Design Group's fee to 15% of all gross revenues received by Clear Channel and supersede any prior agreements between the two firms. Emails show airport officials at one point planned to bring forward a five-year extension of the agreement with Clear Channel for adoption by the Airport Commission in March 2022. The proposed extension would have maintained the status of the Design Group and another designated DBE firm, Doyne Construction Co., as DBE partners with an increased DBE goal of 21%, records show. Malinowski told the Democrat-Gazette that new ACDBE goals are calculated every three years, per federal regulations. The Federal Aviation Administration approved a new goal of 21% for 2022-24, he said in a statement Carter provided in response to emailed questions. Asked about a March 2022 conference call that records show was scheduled between Malinowski, Jackson and a Clear Channel official, Malinowski said, "The parties were working toward a 5-year extension of the advertising agreement but were unable to reach a mutual agreement. Ultimately, there was no extension, and an RFP [request for proposals] was issued." In a May 6, 2022 letter to Abdoul Kabaou, the airport's director of procurement, a Clear Channel Airports official said the firm had "opted not to submit a proposal response at this time." The ACDBE goal of 21% of total gross sales contained in the request for proposals made the advertising concession's financial terms "commercially unfeasible," the letter said. (Clear Channel held the advertising concession through the end of May 2022 and then worked with the airport on a month-to-month basis until the new concessionaire took over on Oct. 1, 2022, according to Carter.) LEASE COMMITTEE For the new concessionaire, airport officials decided to tap Departure Media, a Charleston, S.C.-based firm that had held the advertising concession prior to Clear Channel. But when officials brought before the Airport Commission a measure to formally select Departure Media, they encountered resistance. At one point, commissioner Bill Walker -- a Scott appointee in his first term on the commission and chairman of the lease/consultant selection committee -- sought to have the advertising concession sent out for bids again in an attempt to solicit responses from other firms. During a June 14, 2022, meeting of the lease committee, members were informed that the airport had received two responses to its request for proposals for the advertising concession: Departure Media's proposal and Clear Channel's response that said the firm would not submit a proposal. Kabaou noted Departure Media's DBE participation was 100% and the response had been endorsed by an airport selection committee. Walker expressed concern with regard to the airport only receiving one bid, a fact that commissioner Tiffany Mays O'Guinn questioned, too. Responding to a question from Walker, Kabaou said he did not know what airport officials could do differently to generate more interest if they circulated the request for proposals again, explaining that they had "pushed it hard." Commissioner Stacy Hurst made a motion to accept the staff's recommendation, which failed for lack of a second. A decision was delayed until the following month. OUTREACH It was around this time that Jackson was reaching out to Departure Media, according to Leslie Bensen, the firm's chief executive officer. According to notes from a June 15 phone call between Jackson and a Departure Media official named Kerry Adams, Adams wrote that Jackson "is very well connected to airport staff, the local community, the ACDBE firm that currently handles maintenance, and key political players in the area. ... From his intel, he has heard talk that LIT is considering re-releasing the RFP for a chance at additional bidders/more local participation." She added, "I think he was trying to hold back from telling me 100% of what he has heard, but insinuated that he might be able to influence the decision/prevent a re-release if he can spread word that he will be partnering with us. Clear Channel must have not placed a bid." Bensen later provided what she said were Adams' notes to Kabaou via email, writing that Jackson had called several times, including in May 2022. In addition to numerous other records, pursuant to the Arkansas Freedom of Information Act, the airport provided the email that contained those notes to the Democrat-Gazette along with three voicemails Jackson left for Departure Media. In a voicemail on June 15, 2022, Jackson had called Adams back following a miscommunication related to his email address. He expresses hope that they can "move this project down the field and maybe have a great collaborative partnership." He left another voicemail for Departure Media on June 27, 2022, according to a copy of the message and Adams' notes. When the lease committee met again on July 12, 2022, with Bensen appearing via teleconference, Walker said he remained "extremely concerned" about only receiving one proposal. He also attributed his dissatisfaction to an absence of "local participation." Walker initially made a motion to start negotiations on the contract and later bring it back for approval, which was followed by some back-and-forth discussion with the airport's legal counsel. He ultimately made a motion to reissue the request for proposals, which was approved in a 2-1 vote. Walker and O'Guinn voted yes. Hurst voted no. In a voicemail on July 14, 2022, Jackson says he is trying to reach Bensen. He mentions his relationship with Clear Channel and the Little Rock airport. Jackson recalls telling Adams before about "how we can be supportive of each other potentially on this business in Little Rock, but in light of some things that I've been made aware of and the concerns of the commission around this RFP project, I think we can really help each other and kind of solidify this opportunity for your organization as well as for mine." He says he would "really love to talk with Ms. Bensen about a possible partnership" on the airport's advertising concession. The next day, in an email to airport commissioners, Malinowski wrote that a local television station as well as Jackson had requested recordings of recent airport committee meetings. Malinowski also provided them with a newspaper article about a $17.5 million federal jury award to an Atlanta businessman in 2010. The article said the man had claimed the city of Atlanta and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport "illegally steered a lucrative indoor advertising contract to a competitor with deep political connections." Malinowski told commissioners that the article had been shared with him, but did not identify the source. "Routinely, I communicate information with commissioners and staff in which I believe we can learn from other airports," Malinowski told the Democrat-Gazette when asked what message the article was meant to convey. DECISION When the full Airport Commission met on July 26, 2022, the measure to authorize a five-year contract with Departure Media was on the agenda despite Walker's earlier motion. Commission documents said that in addition to hiring a local sales ambassador, Departure Media intended to retain Doyne Construction Co. for display maintenance. The firm also intended to partner with Think Rubix -- a public-affairs firm connected to the mayor through his former chief of staff -- for brand strategy and community engagement work, meeting materials said. During the meeting, Walker initiated a lengthy discussion with Malinowski and the airport's attorneys about the committee process in light of an opinion issued by legal counsel. Attorneys had concluded that the item must be brought before the full commission and was not properly before the lease committee because of the scope of that committee's responsibilities. A motion to authorize the airport to enter into an agreement with Departure Media eventually was approved in a 4-2 vote. Commissioners Mark Camp, Hurst, John Rutledge and Patrick Schueck voted yes. Walker and O'Guinn voted no. "I did nothing improper, implied nothing improper, and did not communicate with any Commissioners about the status of Departure Media and the RFP," Jackson said in an email. "Now, I cannot speak to what Ms. Adams believes she heard, only what I communicated, which is that I was best suited to bring business to the airport as a local partner; and because I watched the commission meetings I was able to glean that the Commission was displeased with the number of respondents; this is public information and any citizen can access this. Additionally, I would hope that my experience and success in a previous vendor role would influence those voting on a potential vendor contract." Walker did not respond to questions regarding Jackson and the Departure Media deal via email. He ended a call with a reporter when reached by phone at one point. In a recent phone interview, Bensen, the head of Departure Media, said her impression of Jackson's outreach "was that it was unethical." She said she did not call Jackson back. Bensen's rationale was that her firm did not need any additional ACDBE participation for the Little Rock contract; according to her, Departure Media is the only woman-owned airport advertising concessionaire in the country. "I just got the impression that he -- if we did not partner with him, that the RFP process would have been halted, and I'm not sure what would've happened after that," Bensen said.

         Law enforcement in Pulaski County investigated three deaths as homicides in February, making it the county's least deadly month in over two years as Little Rock homicides fell, while police in North Little Rock investigated a higher-than-usual number of killings. The death toll last month was the lowest reported since July 2020, when police also investigated three killings, records from Little Rock and North Little Rock police showed. Monthly homicide totals from the Pulaski County sheriff's office for 2020 or earlier were not available. In February a year ago, Little Rock police investigated six killings while Pulaski County deputies investigated two. No homicides were reported in North Little Rock that month. Little Rock police investigated one of the killings in February, while North Little Rock police investigated the other two. So far this year, each department has investigated six killings. That's an unusually high number for North Little Rock, records provided by the department show. The last time so many killings were reported in the city during the first two months of a year was 2020, when police also investigated six deaths. In 2022, no homicides were reported in North Little Rock until March, with just one reported during the first two months of 2021. In 2018, police investigated seven killings during January and February, the most on record during that period since 1990. Two of the February killings in the county were shootings and one was a stabbing. The average age of victims last month was 39, higher than the average set so far this year, which is 33. The first homicide of the month was the Feb. 7 shooting of Justin Fletcher, 32, of Little Rock. Police following a report of a shooting about 3:19 p.m. at 2701 S. Scott St. found Fletcher shot near the intersection of Daisy Bates Drive and Broadway, about 1½ miles away from the shooting scene. Fletcher was taken to an area hospital where he died of his wounds. During the investigation, police learned that Mohamed Diop, 21, of Little Rock, was wounded in the same Scott Street shooting. Police did not give details on his condition. Police had yet to name a suspect in Fletcher's killing on Saturday. Roderick Allen, 46, of North Little Rock was fatally shot in the 2400 block of Parker Street on Feb. 20. Police found him lying in the road about 5:40 p.m. and he died of his wounds on the scene despite attempts by bystanders and paramedics to treat him. Detectives identified Derrick Colbert, 42, of North Little Rock as a person of interest in the killing and arrested him later that day. He was charged with capital murder and possession of a firearm by certain persons and was held in the Pulaski County jail without bail Saturday, on online inmate roster showed. Colbert pleaded innocent to both charges on Feb. 21, court records showed. A request made with the North Little Rock District Court for the criminal citation in Colbert's case or affidavits filed in his arrest was declined Friday, with a clerk stating that it was a "police arrest" and that the police department would have to provide an arrest report. In the past, homicide incident reports provided by North Little Rock police have not included a narrative of the arrest that might provide more details. Colbert's arrest report, viewed at the Pulaski County jail, referred to a narrative on other pages of the report, but those pages were not provided for inspection. The third homicide of February was the Feb. 26 stabbing of Nikista Jackson, 39, whom officers found lying on the ground in the 700 block of East Bethany Road about 2:36 p.m. Jackson died of his wounds in an area hospital later that day. Police detained Michael Williams, 57, who was at the residence when officers arrived to investigate the homicide report. Williams was arrested and charged with first-degree murder later that day. Williams was held in the Pulaski County jail Saturday without bail, the inmate roster showed. Williams has not yet made a plea in the case, court records show. A request with the district court for documents in Williams' case was similarly denied Friday. Both cases are set to be transferred to the 6th Judicial Circuit Court, the clerk said in an email. Also in February, North Little Rock police arrested a man who has been charged in a Jan. 2 shooting that left Brock Welch, 27, of Sherwood dead. Officers arrested Emil McCoy, 19, of Jacksonville on Feb. 9. McCoy faces a capital murder charge in Welch's death and was held Saturday in the Pulaski County jail without bail, the inmate roster showed. He pleaded innocent Feb. 14, court records showed. So far this year, Little Rock police have made arrests in three of their six homicide investigations. It seemed likely that a fourth case, the Jan. 16 shooting of Stacy Petty, 45, at 56 Epernay Circle, would be closed by exception because the suspect, Stacy's husband Nathan, killed himself after shooting her. North Little Rock police have arrested a suspect in five of the six homicides reported in their jurisdiction so far this year.  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         Little Rock's 911 center director says the first calls about a plane crash that killed five people went unanswered, making it an example of why her improvement plans are important. When the two-engine plane went down south of the Bill and Hillary Clinton National Airport/Adams Field on Feb. 22 amid noontime storms, first responders quickly knew it was serious, director Juana Green said. But calls about the crash came in with a flow of other calls from around the capital city, she said. The first three calls about the crash didn't get through to an operator immediately. Instead, call center employees returned the calls. KARK4 first published the details of the 911 calls, obtained from Little Rock police via an Arkansas Freedom of Information Act request. The center has not been under police control since January 2022. "We got a call from this number, is everything OK?" an operator can be heard asking. The first caller, an employee at Dassault Falcon Jet, reported seeing the plane crash in a fireball. "The airplane took off in crazy weather and it ended up just rolling into the ground," the caller said. A dispatch log indicates that the call was received at 12:02 p.m., less than a minute after the incident was entered in the dispatch system. Firefighters at the airport had simultaneously reported the crash and began responding, Green said. At 12:03, a call-taker returned the call of another person at the airport who witnessed the crash and spoke with a third caller who had seen the crash around 12:05. It took between one and two minutes for employees to return those calls, Green said. The crash site was in the Pulaski County sheriff's office's jurisdiction, and Green said its dispatchers may have gotten other calls. She didn't want to call the response to the crash typical, but said it went smoothly and wasn't unusual because of the regular volume of calls and the number of employees. Even if she filled all 11 seats in the call center with call-takers, Green said, a 12th caller would always have to wait or be called back. Five or six people typically work in the center at a time, she said, and while all of them can take calls if needed, some work as dispatchers or supervisors. "It's just the nature of the beast," said Green, who has worked in emergency communications for 20 years, including in her native New Orleans. Green doesn't want residents to lose faith in the 911 center because operators can't immediately take their calls, she said. Emergency call centers across the country are also swamped with calls. "That may not mean much to our residents because we are concerned with our 911 center -- I get it," Green said. It's not the first time concerns have been expressed about the system. Answering questions from residents about call wait times, police Chief Heath Helton on Jan. 12 said Green "came into some challenges" when she took over the system. Green said she's reorganized the way the emergency communications center works. When she showed up, some employees weren't even aware there were national standards for response time, and now the call center is on track for national accreditation. Green switched employees from eight-hour shifts to 12-hour shifts, she said, supplanting four-hour mandatory overtime that came with those shorter shifts and implementing four-day work schedules. Another big change will be the move to a standardized training regimen that ensures all the call-takers are asking the same questions and getting the same information. It helps cut down on dead air, Green said, and provides a consistent metric for employee performance. Finally, Green said she hopes to move to automatic call distribution, which means that instead of hearing the phone ring and having to manually pick it up to take the call, the next call in line will automatically drop into the operator's headset, shaving time off their response. On Feb. 25, a few days after the plane crash, six new call center employees completed their training, Green said. That was half of the dozen people that started the training program. The next application period was set to open this month, and their training would begin in May, Green said. She said she is optimistic that the new procedures and a continued influx of new employees can help ease residents' woes with the 911 system in Little Rock.

         FAYETTEVILLE -- Chris Jones has seen drug abuse from both sides, spending time in prison and going through drug court before finding a life helping others. "I believe recovery is possible for everyone, if they can stay alive long enough," Jones said in a recent interview. Jones, a certified peer support specialist in Arkansas, is working with Northwest Arkansas Harm Reduction to help people who are using drugs stay alive and work toward changing their lives. Part of the work being done by NWA Harm Reduction includes providing fentanyl test strips, syringes, condoms and naloxone overdose reversal kits to people who are using drugs. The group also helps people ready to find services to help them end their addiction. Brittany Kelly, founder of NWA Harm Reduction, said that since November the group has given out 372 naloxone kits, 401 fentanyl test strips, 490 syringes and 66 condoms. She said from information received from those who have used the services the group provides, she believes the work has saved at least 40 lives in that time. As part of their work, the group has also been lobbying for changes in the state's drug laws making possession or use of fentanyl test strips a felony. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the test strips can be used to detect fentanyl in many kinds of drugs and drug forms, both pills and injectibles, and reduce the risk of overdose. At least two bills are pending in the state Legislature to address the test strips' classification as drug paraphernalia. Kelly said she's pleased the effort to change Arkansas drug laws has gained support. "It will help people who are seeking help," Kelly said. Jones, 37, of Rogers said he has been in prison in Arkansas and Missouri for car theft and other crimes. Drug abuse was a part of his lifestyle from his teen years until he chose to change, he said. "I decided I was tired of tucking my kids into bed over the phone from prison," he said. Jones said the Benton County Drug Court program "saved my life" and after he completed that program, he wanted to help others. He remained active with the drug court program and began working for a local recovery center. Jones said he became aware while working in recovery support efforts that Arkansas law declared fentanyl test strips to be drug paraphernalia and decided he didn't care about the risk of going back to prison if he was helping save lives. "It's a risk I'm willing to take," he said. "I'm really tired of burying my friends because they didn't know what they were buying. I understand that what I'm doing is against the law. I understand that using drugs is illegal, but I don't believe it needs to be a death sentence." The CDC says fentanyl is a synthetic opioid up to 50 times stronger than heroin and 100 times stronger than morphine. It is often added to other drugs because of its extreme potency, which makes drugs cheaper, more powerful, more addictive and more dangerous. Jones said the risk of unknowingly ingesting fentanyl has changed the environment in which people use drugs. "When I was doing drugs, I knew I was going to wake up," he said. "People today don't have that option." According to the federal Drug Enforcement Administration, many people are overdosing on fentanyl who thought they were taking other drugs. The agency reported seven "mass-overdose events" involving 58 overdoses and 29 overdose deaths in just a two-month period of 2022. "Many of the victims of those mass overdoses thought they were ingesting cocaine and had no idea they were in fact ingesting fentanyl," the agency reported. Jones said he has been working for the past few years to persuade Arkansas legislators to change the drug paraphernalia laws to remove test strips from the description of drug paraphernalia. State Sen. Justin Boyd, R-Fort Smith, introduced Senate Bill 40, which would decriminalize test strips in Arkansas, excluding the test strips from the definition of drug paraphernalia. Boyd said an article in the Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette alerted him to the growing fentanyl problem. He said he gathered more information at a legislative conference on the nationwide opioid abuse issue and was also contacted by Kelly and others working with the Northwest Arkansas Harm Reduction Foundation. Boyd, who owns a pharmacy in Alma, said criminalizing the test strips makes no sense to him. "Why would the state say 'You're going to prison for possessing fentanyl test strips?'" Boyd said. Boyd said his bill would bring Arkansas law in line with what is happening in other states. He said he has "deferred" the bill because a larger bill also includes the test strip provision, but he will run his bill if needed. Senate Bill 283, also known as "The Fentanyl Enforcement and Accountability Act of 2023," is also pending in the state Legislature. The bill would establish a "death by delivery" statute meant to hold dealers responsible for any overdose deaths tied to their drugs. Those who deal fentanyl could be charged with "aggravated death by delivery" and face 20-60 years or life in prison and a $1 million fine if prosecutors can tie it to an overdose death. Another provision of the bill would change state law on fentanyl test strips so they would no longer be considered drug paraphernalia if the bill passes. The emergency clause attached to the bill, which would make it take effect immediately upon passage, states in 2021 the State Crime Lab did autopsies in 496 drug overdose deaths and, of those, 282 involved fentanyl. In 2016, according to the bill, there were 207 overdose deaths and only eight involved fentanyl. Boyd said he reached out to the state's prosecuting attorneys about the changes regarding the test strips and received no pushback from them. Washington County Prosecuting Attorney Matt Durrett is president of the state Prosecuting Attorneys Association. Durrett said the group discussed the proposed changes regarding the test strips and he heard no opposition to it. Durrett said he couldn't remember prosecuting a case involving the use of test strips. [DOCUMENT: Read the bill on fentanyl test strips » arkansasonline.com/35sb40/] "We were fully supportive of that bill," Durrett said of Boyd's bill. "The feeling was that it's a very good idea, especially in this day and age. Fentanyl is so dangerous and so deadly. A lot of the people overdosing on fentanyl are unknowingly taking it because it's mixed in with other drugs. Drug paraphernalia is generally meant to be things used to ingest, inject, inhale or otherwise to use drugs and to manufacture or sell a controlled substance. The use of test strips is a way to save lives." The criminalization of "testing equipment" under state and local drug laws goes back to at least the 1970s, according to information gathered by the Legislative Analysis and Public Policy Association in a report titled "Drug Paraphernalia: Summary of State Laws." According to information in the report, after many state and local drug laws were challenged in courts, the DEA drafted a "Model Drug Paraphernalia Act" in August 1979. That draft act, which included testing equipment in its definition of drug paraphernalia, was adopted by 38 states and the District of Columbia within a few years and remained largely unchanged for more than 30 years. Other states adopted similar laws. The Legislative Analysis report also said 49 states and the District of Columbia have "one or more criminal laws" pertaining to drug paraphernalia, with Alaska being the lone exception. As of March 2022, the use of test strips and/or testing equipment was legal for at least some individuals in 25 states and illegal for all individuals in 25 states unless the state had a "Good Samaritan" law, providing an exception in cases involving efforts to prevent fatal overdoses. In seven states, testing equipment is included in the definition of drug paraphernalia but there's no criminal penalty for using or possessing the equipment. According to the report, efforts to change the laws regarding testing equipment are underway in many states. In 2022, changes were approved or pending in at least 11 states where the use of testing equipment is not allowed -- including California, Washington, Utah, Kansas, Missouri, Louisiana, Georgia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and Connecticut -- while similar efforts failed in Florida, Mississippi and New Jersey. According to news reports, bills have been introduced in Texas and Mississippi this year to allow the use of test strips, and the governors of Ohio and Pennsylvania recently signed laws decriminalizing test strips. In a report released in April, the DEA described fentanyl as "highly addictive" and said it was found in all 50 states. The agency said drug traffickers are increasingly mixing fentanyl with other drugs -- in powder and pill form -- "in an effort to drive addiction and attract repeat buyers." The drug dealers sell their products as cocaine or as pills made to look like legitimate prescription pills. "This is creating a frightening nationwide trend where many overdose victims are dying after unknowingly ingesting fentanyl," the agency said in the report. "Fentanyl is driving the nationwide overdose epidemic," the agency reported. "The CDC estimates that in the 12-month period ending in October 2021, over 105,000 Americans died of drug overdoses and over 66% of those deaths were related to fentanyl and other synthetic opioids. Last year (2021) the United States suffered more fentanyl-related deaths than gun-related and auto-related deaths combined."

         A Scott County man died in flooding near Waldron, according to a news release from the Scott County sheriff's office. The sheriff's office reports it was alerted early Friday morning that the man was supposed to meet his grandson on Manorcrest Road but had never arrived and had not returned home. Deputies searched the area and tried to track the man's cellphone, but both efforts proved unsuccessful. After water levels began to recede later that morning, a motorist traveling on Arkansas 248 reported the top of a pickup visible in the Poteau River, according to the release. Deputies and other first responders went to the area and discovered a heavily damaged truck unoccupied and mostly submerged. Upon searching the area, first responders found the man's body a short distance from the truck just before 8 a.m., the release says. The sheriff's office said the initial investigation indicates the truck was likely swept from the road and into the river near Arkansas 80 and Manorcrest Road. The man's identity is not being released at this time.  Print Headline: Scott County man dies in flooding Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         BENTONVILLE -- The fate of a proposal to consolidate the Bentonville School District's bus stops should become clearer at the School Board's meeting next week. Board members have expressed some concerns about safety and requested additional information related to the plan. Superintendent Debbie Jones said if the board is not prepared to make a decision on the plan next week, she would recommend postponing implementation of it by a year and continuing with the bus stops as they are, at least through the 2023-24 school year. "Because I don't want to do this poorly. And it's going to take that amount of time to do it well," Jones said, during the board's last meeting on Feb. 21. The board's next meeting is set for 5:30 p.m. March 14. Administrators introduced the transportation proposal in January. The board discussed the proposal again for about 30 minutes at its February meeting. Jason Salmons, the district's transportation director, presented the proposal to consolidate multiple bus stops to locations such as parks, churches and businesses with large parking lots, within 1 mile of most homes. Exactly how many stops there would be and where has not been determined. He said this could reduce the number of bus routes from 118 to about 89 -- a 25% cut. Families would be able to register for a preferred bus stop and students would still be scheduled by elementary and secondary groups, according to administrators. Salmons said while parents would have to get more involved in getting their kids to and from the bus stop, it also would result in a more reliable transportation system. The district had 152 delayed routes and 149 canceled routes during the first four months of this school year because of a driver shortage, according to Salmons. At the February board meeting, he presented examples of how much time could be saved by consolidating stops. One example had to do with a pair of buses that loop through the Shadow Valley subdivision in Rogers each morning and afternoon carrying students to and from Evening Star Elementary School. Each bus currently takes 24 to 29 minutes per one-way trip. If bus stops within Shadow Valley were consolidated to one -- at the subdivision's clubhouse -- each bus trip would take only about eight minutes, Salmons said. He said the district has a little over 2,500 bus stops, but it's too early to say how many there would be under a consolidated system. "That will take us months to do," Salmons said. If the board decides to adopt consolidated bus routes, the district will evaluate every bus stop it has, he said. Some stops may be consolidated while others will remain in place for various reasons, he said. Several board members expressed concern about students walking in certain areas that aren't pedestrian-friendly, especially in Bella Vista and rural areas. Kelly Carlson, board president, said the feedback he's received from the community on the consolidation plan revolves around Bella Vista, with its many winding roads and lack of sidewalks in most areas. "And I don't know if I've seen much to address Bella Vista specifically from a safety issue," Carlson told Salmons, referring to the information Salmons had presented. Willie Cowgur, board vice president, said the proposal is the right move from an efficiency standpoint, but from a safety standpoint, it will be a harder sell. "I'm gonna have to feel really, really good about the safety plan we have with this before we move forward," Cowgur said.

         Garland County Sheriff Mike McCormick said Saturday that there were possible human remains in a submerged vehicle that was being recovered from Lake Hamilton after it was found in the 800 block of Lakeland Point. The vehicle was floated using air bags and was being towed by boat to a nearby ramp Saturday afternoon. McCormick told The Sentinel-Record that the sheriff's office didn't get confirmation that there was a vehicle in the water until Friday. As far as the remains, McCormick said nothing has been confirmed and won't be until they get the car out of the lake. The Garland County sheriff's office, Hot Springs Fire Department and other agencies were working jointly Saturday to recover the vehicle. The Fire Department's swift-water team initially staged, along with sheriff's units, on Lakeland Point on Friday afternoon, then returned to the area Saturday afternoon. A wrecker was initially brought to that location, then relocated to a nearby boat ramp. The sheriff's office has not yet released information about the vehicle, how it was discovered or how long it has been submerged. The vehicle was being pulled by boat to a boat ramp at Beach Front Rezorts, 352 Lakeland Drive, shortly before 5 p.m. Saturday, but it was after sunset by the time it was pulled from the lake.

         Armed bystanders stop suspect in LR Police arrested a man Thursday afternoon who authorities say stole a vehicle in North Little Rock before trying to steal another in Little Rock, where he was stopped and held at gunpoint by bystanders until officers arrived, according to arrest reports. Little Rock officers arrested Myron Littleton, 32, near 824 East Ninth St. around 2:30 p.m. after they say he tried to rob a woman and take her vehicle but was stopped by a bystander and a security guard working at the Regions Bank at that address, who both pulled guns on Littleton. A North Little Rock police report lists Littleton as a resident of Greenville, Miss., while the Little Rock arrest report lists him as a homeless Little Rock resident. North Little Rock police had been looking for Littleton after responding to a report around 2 p.m. that someone matching his description had gotten into a woman's car and drove off after she left it running in the parking lot of a Valero gas station at 1429 South Locust St. A bystander pursued the stolen vehicle south into Little Rock, police said. The two crime scenes are about 2 miles apart from each other along Interstate 30. It was not clear from the reports if the bystander who pursued Littleton into Little Rock was the same one that held him at gunpoint. North Little Rock police searched the vehicle they say Littleton stole and found a loaded Smith & Wesson .38 special handgun within reach of the driver's seat. He is a convicted felon and cannot legally own a gun. Littleton was held Saturday evening in the Pulaski County jail in lieu of $30,000 bond. He faces felony charges of robbery, possession of a firearm by certain persons and theft of property.

         Key takes position in consulting firm Former Arkansas Secretary of Education Johnny Key has become a partner in the education management consulting firm Strategos Group, where he is joining the company's State Superintendent Engagement Practice. Founded in 2011, Strategos is made up of former state education commissioners, legislators, White House appointees and business leaders to advise Fortune 500 companies, nonprofits, startups, philanthropy and private equity organizations. Strategos Group operates at the national, state and local levels with offices in Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Maryland, Tennessee, Texas and Washington, D.C. "The Strategos team, with its subject-matter expertise and unmatched policy insight, has set itself apart as a leader in education management consulting," Key said in a prepared announcement of his new role. "Joining this group of esteemed professionals who share my passion for education provides me the opportunity to continue working to advance smart policies that will help ensure future generations are provided quality education choices," he said. Key served as secretary of the Arkansas Department of Education from 2019 to 2023 and as commissioner of the department from 2015 to 2019, overseeing the state's 237 school districts and 18 charter school systems. Before heading the state education agency, Key was associate vice president for university relations for the University of Arkansas System. He was a state senator from 2009 to 2014 and a state representative from 2003 to 2008. He began his career in public service in 1997 when he was elected to serve as a justice of the peace on the Baxter County Quorum Court. Overhaul proposed for NLR elementary North Little Rock Superintendent Gregory Pilewski has proposed a comprehensive redesign of the district's Seventh Street Elementary School, including a change in the name to "6-57 Learning Institute" for the campus that would eventually serve pre-kindergarten through eighth graders. The proposed 6-57 Learning Institute would pay tribute to the six Black teenagers who tried to desegregate North Little Rock High School in the fall of 1957 but were turned away by an angry mob and the superintendent, according to the district. Desegregation of North Little Rock High did not occur until the fall of 1966 when 20 Black students were enrolled. Other changes at the school include an as yet to be determined academic-themed community campus with a focus on project-based learning. Possibilities being explored include engineering, animal science and computer science. All licensed staff at the school would be offered the opportunity to reapply for their current positions. To attract, retain, and reward high-quality leaders, teachers, and staff, licensed employees at the school will be presented with a $17,000 stipend over a three-year period, above the current district-wide pay levels. "The additional stipend is designed to attract and reward our best and brightest leaders and teachers to improve education at one of our lowest-performing schools. Simply put, great leaders and great teachers make great schools," Pilewski said in presenting the plans. UALR plans camp for cybersecurity The University of Arkansas at Little Rock will host a nationwide summer camp for up to 100 junior high and high school students who want to learn skills in the high-demand field of cybersecurity. The Arkansas GenCyber Strength Training Program is open to rising students in grades seven through 12. The two-week summer camp will be held 8:30 a.m.-12:30 p.m., June 19-22 and June 26-29. There will be both virtual and in-person camp options so that students from across the state can participate even if they are unable to travel to Little Rock. The camp is offered at no cost to participants as the result of a grant from the National Security Agency. Camp participants will hear from industry experts about career opportunities and will learn about cybersecurity with state-of-the art, hands-on activities that will enable them to experience cyberattacks from both the victim and adversary sides. Students will also participate in hands-on activities in cyber attacks and defense provided through UALR's Cyber Arena, which already provides cloud-based cybersecurity labs to students and educators in Arkansas.

         Short-term-rental proposal on hold The North Little Rock City Council may vote on a proposed ordinance regulating short-term rentals in the coming weeks. The proposal would affect short-term rentals -- homes or units that are rented out for a fee, much like Airbnb or Vrbo -- and set rules regarding noise, garbage and parking, among other things, to the business license holder. The proposed ordinance was introduced before the council on Feb. 13, then read a second time on Feb. 27. The third reading, likely at the council's next scheduled meeting on March 13, will be the first time the council would take a vote. The agenda for March 13 has not yet been released. No one spoke for or against the proposal at last week's council meeting. One issue facing the council is whether the state Legislature will pass Senate Bill 197 -- which would put some restrictions on Arkansas cities and counties from passing rules limiting people from using properties as short-term rentals. The North Little Rock proposal, although presented and then given a second reading, has been on hold. Mayor Terry Hartwick said at the Feb. 27 council meeting the North Little Rock proposal wasn't moving forward with a vote until legislators decide what to do with their bill. Until then, he said, "We're kind of between what we can do and what we're not able to do." But Council Member Debi Ross, who is co-sponsoring the North Little Rock proposal with Council Member Charlie Hight, said at the meeting that the state Legislature's proposed bill is not the reason she agrees to hold off on a North Little Rock council vote. Rather, she said she wants the North Little Rock proposal read at three separate council meetings before there's a vote. "I want to make sure there's full transparency and that we just don't suspend all the rules and pass it on just one night," Ross said. Food truck permit day is scheduled The North Little Rock Convention and Visitors Bureau will host its first North Little Rock Food Truck Permitting Day on March 15. Permit day would be a chance for food trucks to get licensed and permitted to operate in North Little Rock by completing all regulatory steps -- such as health and fire inspections, a business license application and a North Little Rock Advertising and Promotion Commission permit application -- in one appointment, according to the Convention and Visitors Bureau. The event is scheduled to take place at 200 Poplar St., North Little Rock (the empty lot west of Simmons Bank Arena) and is by appointment only. It is not open to the general public. North Little Rock had 89 food trucks permitted to operate in 2022. "Unlike brick-and-mortar restaurants with an established location, some food truck operators move frequently and can be difficult for the City and the [Convention and Visitors Bureau] to track and enforce health, safety, and legal requirements," the agency said. "Food trucks that are licensed and permitted are also added to an approved list used by the City, [Convention and Visitors Bureau] and event planners for special events in North Little Rock as well as listed on the North Little Rock [Convention and Visitors Bureau] website, northlittlerock.org." As an incentive for completing the applications, food truck operators will be entered for the chance to win a buzzer pager system. Any food truck operator permitted between Jan. 1 and March 15 will be entered. Baptist adds 10 critical care beds Baptist Health Medical Center-North Little Rock has opened a new 10-bed critical care unit, bringing the total number of critical care beds to 44. The medical intensive care unit on the hospital's ground floor, across from the Emergency Department, is equipped to work with patients who have life-saving and complex care needs, said Cody Walker, president of Baptist Health Medical Center-North Little Rock, in a news release. CDI Contractors completed construction and Nashville, Tenn.-based Earl Swensson Associates Inc. was the architect. Elementary school on meeting agenda The North Little Rock School Board will hold a workshop and special meeting on Thursday at 5:30 p.m. in the Administration Building Board Room, 2400 Willow St. At the special meeting, Superintendent Gregory J. Pilewski will ask the board to send his Seventh Street Elementary School Reconfiguration and Transformation Stipend plan to the district's Licensed Personnel Policies Committee for review. The district plans a comprehensive redesign of the district's Seventh Street Elementary School. All licensed staff members at the school would get a $17,000 stipend over a three-year period, above the current districtwide pay levels, as a way to attract, retain and reward high-quality leaders, teachers and staff. The meeting is open to the public and will be broadcast on the district's YouTube Channel-NLRSD Board Meetings.

         HOT SPRINGS -- Hot Springs has more than $40 million in unfunded capital needs and more than $7 million in federal pandemic relief funds. The Police Department made its pitch Tuesday for some of the latter, asking the Hot Springs Board of Directors to consider using the restricted balance in the city's American Rescue Plan Act allocation to purchase an armored vehicle for the SWAT team. The Lenco BearCat is the preeminent armored tactical rescue vehicle, interim Police Chief Billy Hrvatin told the board. It would replace the 2002 Ford Excursion the SWAT team uses as its "jump-off vehicle," Hrvatin said. "It has oversized running boards, so guys can offload off of it," he said. "It has no ballistic protection." Officers have been shot at or been at scenes where shots were fired four times in the past eight years, Hrvatin said. "Ballistic protection is a priority for us," he said, noting the SWAT team has responded to 64 critical incidents in the past five years. The $246,000 BearCat Hrvatin requested is built on a Ford F-350 chassis. Its armor is rated for a .50-caliber round. An armored fuel tank, blast-resistant door and top hatch are some of the other features. It can carry up to 12 officers. "It has a stand-alone AC unit in the back, which is very important for guys wearing 25 to 50 pounds of gear in the summertime," Hrvatin said. City Manager Bill Burrough told the board last summer the BearCat would replace the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected, or MRAP, vehicle the city purchased from the Department of Defense in 2014. The inability to find parts has made it difficult to maintain the military vehicle. Burrough told the board Tuesday the MRAP will remain in service. Hrvatin said the smaller BearCat is easier to drive than the 50,000-pound MRAP. "It's very easy to operate," he told the board. "It's like driving a truck. It has 360-degree cameras that make it easy to see around you. It's not like driving the MRAP. That takes two people, because you need a navigator to help the driver see." The committee Burrough formed last year to prioritize the city's unfunded capital needs rated an armored recovery vehicle as the most urgent item. It's unclear how the committee determined its rankings. No minutes or attendance sheets were available. The city clerk's office said none were required, explaining that the meetings weren't open to the public. According to information the city provided, the committee is composed of six members of the public: Linda Franklin, Alan Spraggins, Karen Kitchens, Bruce Jones, Todd Green and Mary Curry. The city board will be the ultimate arbiter of how the projects are ranked. Hrvatin also requested a Draco Gas Delivery System for the BearCat's breaching arm. The forced air delivery system can put tear gas into a structure or vehicle. "It's initiated by remote," Hrvatin said. "It can put a lot of gas into a house very quickly." He said the ability to deploy gas remotely may have enabled a more expeditious resolution to the 11-hour standoff the SWAT team had at an East Grand Avenue trailer park in 2018. Gas deployed manually was unable to reach the suspect, who was shooting at officers from the back of the residence. "We had a gentleman in a house that would not come out," Hrvatin said. "We breached the front door, and he shot at us. At the time we had no remote delivery option for gas. We had to call the state police. They brought their BearCat, which had a gas needle. They punched a hole in the wall and got him out of the house." Hrvatin said the remote delivery system costs $21,500. The 2019 police fund budget included $27,000 to equip the MRAP with a breaching arm and gas needle. The city said its American Rescue Plan Act restricted fund had a $1.4 million balance. Department of Treasury rules require American Rescue Plan Act funds to be committed by next year and spent by 2026.

         FORT SMITH -- A new hospital has opened to provide health care for River Valley residents. The Fort Smith ER & Hospital at 4701 Phoenix Ave. off Interstate 540 was founded by board-certified emergency physicians and Nutex Health Inc. According to the hospital's website, it opened with a mission to put patients first with "top-notch emergency room nurses, medical technicians and technical staff." It also notes the hospital's cutting edge technology with the most advanced imaging and diagnostic equipment available and a full clinical laboratory, including CT scans, ultrasound and x-ray. "No matter the injury or illness, our facility is ready and equipped to provide you with the emergency care you deserve 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. And with an average wait time of five minutes, you'll be on your way to feeling your best quicker than ever," the website states. The Fort Smith Regional Chamber of Commerce announced the opening of the hospital on its Facebook page Monday. The chamber noted the hospital offers clinical, pediatrics, imaging and laboratory services. Its post said the hospital has four inpatient beds and eight emergency room beds in the 18,000-square-foot, state-of-the-art emergency room, as well as an on-site laboratory. "Patients will be met with the convenience of emergency care in the comfort of a pleasant environment, friendly faces, a short wait, and ample one-on-one time with a physician," the post states. "No matter the injury or illness a patient presents, the Fort Smith ER & Hospital's staff is prepared to serve the community. "Fort Smith ER & Hospital looks forward to exceeding the health and safety expectations with an enthusiastic staff ready to serve all in the Fort Smith community and surrounding areas." Fort Smith is also home to Baptist Health-Fort Smith and Mercy Hospital Fort Smith. In 2022 alone, Mercy had 158 physicians tend to 226,539 outpatient visits across its 37 clinic and outpatient locations, according to the hospital's website. "We look forward to working collaboratively with Fort Smith ER and Hospital in caring for the patients we are called to serve in the Arkansas River Valley," said Mardi Taylor, Mercy's senior communications coordinator. At his state of the city address on Monday, Mayor George McGill said one of the key pillars of a good community is having a strong health base. He recognized Mercy Hospital's more than $160 million expansion at 7301 Rogers Ave. The hospital plans to expand its emergency room from 29 to 50 rooms and the intensive care unit from 38 to 64 beds, which Mercy says will allow it to care for an additional 25,000 patients each year. The expansion will also include the construction of a two-floor parking garage and other service lots creating more than 140 parking spaces for the campus. Construction is projected to end in 2024 and result in 300 permanent direct and indirect jobs across the River Valley totaling more than $25 million.

         LITTLE ROCK -- Philander Smith College has been awarded nearly $3 million to improve high-speed internet access. The $2,999,903 grant from the Connecting Minority Communities pilot program -- which is run by the U.S. Department of Commerce's National Telecommunications and Information Administration and is part of the Biden administration's Internet for All initiative -- was announced Monday by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration. Philander Smith College is one of 61 minority-serving colleges and universities to receive these grants, which total $175 million. With this latest set of grants, all funding from the Internet for All grant program has been awarded to 93 universities, including 43 Historically Black Colleges and Universities, 24 Hispanic Serving Institutions, 21 Minority Serving Institutions, and five Tribal Colleges and Universities, according to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration. The Connecting Minority Communities pilot program is part of the administration's Internet for All initiative that aims to connect everyone in America with affordable, reliable high-speed internet service. The project's goal is to improve, upgrade and expand the use of technology on campus with a focus on innovation to enhance student learning and provide more effective administrative functions for faculty and staff, according to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration. Philander Smith College will "implement campus enterprise-level resources, refreshing technology for both students and employees, purchase internet access service, install and upgrade broadband facilities, improve wireless connectivity on campus, and purchase eligible equipment and devices for student and community resident use." The college will also "provide one-to-one devices for freshmen students, prioritizing [those] in need, provide Wi-Fi hotspots for students, and anchor community residents who participate in [Philander Smith]-led workforce development and community engagement programs," according to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration. "The proposed Wi-Fi hotspot lending program will allow community residents to check out technology for their own educational purposes," too. "Access to affordable, reliable, high-speed Internet service is necessary for minority students and local communities to fully access school, healthcare, and jobs," Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said in a National Telecommunications and Information Administration news release. "The Department of Commerce has made significant investment into minority-serving colleges and universities, and I am proud to say that all funding from the Connecting Minority Communities program has been distributed to help make internet connectivity a reality for tens of thousands of students at minority-serving colleges and universities across the country." Founded in 1877, Philander Smith College is one of the oldest private, historically Black institutions of higher learning in the state, according to the college. The liberal arts college is affiliated with the United Methodist Church and is the only United Negro College Fund member school in the state. Current enrollment is approximately 700, according to Sericia Nelson, executive strategist at the college. In the latest U.S. News & World Report Best Colleges rankings, released last fall, Philander Smith College ranked 41st for regional colleges in the South and tied for 40th among national historically Black colleges and universities. According to the Encyclopedia of Arkansas, alumni include Dr. Joycelyn Elders, a former U.S. surgeon general; the Rev. James H. Cone, a professor at Union Theological Seminary in New York; Lottie Shackelford, the first woman to serve as Little Rock's mayor; former National Football League player Elijah Pitts; and former Harlem Globetrotters basketball player Hubert "Geese" Ausbie.

         FORT SMITH --Arkansas Colleges of Health Education will celebrate completing the first phase of an ongoing renovation that's part of its efforts to create a healthier region. The school will hold a ribbon-cutting for the first floor of its Research Institute Health and Wellness Center at 11 a.m. Friday. The facility is in the former Golden Living corporate offices at 1000 Fianna Way, which the school announced it bought for an undisclosed amount in September 2020. The building is 318,000 square feet and sits on 63 acres included in the purchase. Kyle Parker, president and CEO of the school, said the first floor will serve as the "health and wellness center portion" of the center. It will house a variety of programs aimed to help college students in their education, as well as residents of the River Valley community. "This is something that Fort Smith has never seen, doesn't have access to, but it fits right in with our mission," Parker said. "Hopefully, we will bring tremendous change in the health of this region. That's the goal."   Parker said doctorate program students in occupational therapy and physical therapy will be able to make use of the new facility. The school's master of public health degree program, which is scheduled to start in fall 2024, will be based there as well. Elizabeth McClain, the school's chief wellness officer and director of the public health degree program, said the new center's first floor provides an opportunity for the community to engage with different health and wellness activities in the arts and education at times that are open for them. It also provides an opportunity for community partner organizations, who will help facilitate programs at the facility, to engage side by side with one another. Parker said the center's first floor spans about 80,000 square feet. A floor plan shows its spaces dedicated to art and art education include two galleries, classrooms, an applied arts lab and a ceramics lab. McClain said any scientific discovery is embedded in creativity and curiosity, as well as the urgency to find an answer. The incorporation of art and creativity into the new center will allow the school to focus on that particular aspect as it tries to improve quality of life in the community. "When we're around creativity, when we're around beauty, around art, whether it's ceramics, or it's being in applied arts where we're looking at functional art that is beautiful, or we're looking at a painting or a statue, we feel better," McClain said. "We're able to take that break, take that pause, and we feel healthier, and we see that over and over again." The galleries will feature art of different media from the Fort Smith Regional Art Museum and Arts on Main in Van Buren -- who will also provide art classes -- and several other independent artists, according to McClain. The school is also developing an artist-in-residence program at the center. McClain said the Fort Smith-based Cre8ive Arts Network will be a community partner in the ceramics lab, where people will be able to make, and learn how to make, pottery. The applied arts lab, headed up by Fab Lab Fort Smith, will focus on different ways to create things both functional and "aesthetically beautiful," including through 3D printers. Parker said someone can use these 3D printers to create prosthetic devices. "Let's say that somebody has lost some fingers and their hands, they can no longer pick up a toothbrush," Parker said. "Well, with these devices, you can create straps and the entire toothbrush itself, and then that way they can literally just strap that onto their hands to brush their teeth." Kenneth Moon, one of the directors of Fab Lab Fort Smith, said people will be able to use electronic stations and laser cutters in the applied arts lab as well. He said he believes the new space will help Fab Lab Fort Smith achieve its goal of building a culture of makers, hackers, inventors and artists. "At the intersection of those skill sets, I think that you can create new ideas that don't exist yet, and I think people will see things in our community that we've never seen before," Moon said. McClain said the center also includes a teaching kitchen where people will be able to learn more about nutrition and healthy eating. Parker said Western Arkansas Ballet in Fort Smith will have a space in which it can teach dance adjacent to a fitness lab. Other elements of the center's first floor include a research clinic, conference rooms, offices and an event center that can seat more than 650 people. A number of outdoor facilities are planned for the center as well, such as walking, biking and canopy trails. However, Parker said these won't be finished come Friday. Parker said renovating the first floor of the former Golden Living building for the new center lasted about 18 months. He estimated the school's entire renovation of the facility, which encompasses five floors, will cost the school more than $60 million overall.  None  The other floors The third floor of the Arkansas Colleges of Health Education's Research Institute Health and Wellness Center, as well as half of the second, is dedicated to research. The remainder of the second floor will house additional clinic space for the school and classroom space for Arkansas Tech University alongside offices for other entities. In addition, the fourth floor will hold a new campus of Haas Hall Academy, an open-enrollment, public charter school. The fifth floor is dedicated to Arkansas Oklahoma Gas.

         FORT SMITH -- Fort Smith is in an amazing place after several years of hardship, Mayor George McGill said in his state of the city address Monday. The mayor, speaking at the University of Arkansas at Fort Smith, discussed all of the accomplishments the city made in 2022 despite continued impacts of the historic flood in 2019 and the covid pandemic in 2020. McGill also spoke about the Foreign Military Sales Pilot Training Center program. Ebbing Air National Guard Base at Fort Smith Regional Airport was selected last year as the Air Force's preferred location for a pilot training center for Singapore and other countries participating in the Foreign Military Sales program. The program would accommodate up to 24 foreign Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II aircraft and move 12 General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcons from the Singapore Air Force, currently at Luke Air Force Base in Glendale, Ariz. While Ebbing is the preferred location, the Air Force may chose Selfridge Air National Guard Base in Harrison Township, Mich., if the center couldn't be at Fort Smith. The Air Force released its environmental impact statement in the Federal Register last month, which includes comments received from the public and stakeholders from a 45-day draft period last fall. It's in a mandatory 30-day waiting period before signing a record of decision, which could happen Tuesday at the earliest. McGill said if Ebbing is selected, the River Valley could see an annual economic impact of $800 million to $1 billion. "We're going to be welcoming them hopefully in June or July," McGill said. "What they're trying to do is they're trying to compress a five-year process into three years, so that timeline could gradually move as they get closer, but from all indications, they're going to be coming to Fort Smith." McGill said one of the key pillars of a good community is having a strong health base. He said the Arkansas Colleges of Health Education is aiding in this as it prepares for its first group of doctors to graduate. "And they're getting ready to to have a ribbon cutting on the country's largest health and wellness research center here in America," McGill said. "That's here in Fort Smith. Think about it, 150 to 160 research scientists living and working in Fort Smith, talking about the value of having good health and wellness." McGill also recognized Mercy Hospital's more than $160 million expansion at 7301 Rogers Ave. The hospital plans to expand its emergency room from 29 to 50 rooms and the intensive care unit from 38 to 64 beds, which Mercy says will allow it to care for an additional 25,000 patients each year. The expansion will also include the construction of a two-floor parking garage and other service lots creating more than 140 parking spaces for the campus. Construction is projected to end in 2024 and result in 300 permanent direct and indirect jobs across the River Valley totaling more than $25 million he said. "Those things don't happen by accident," McGill said. "The leadership out there, they didn't pull their name out of a hat. So they're going to invest $160 million in this city. They had to compete for that money." McGill said in the last four years, the city has invested more than $80 million in drainage and wastewater work. The city entered into a consent decree in January 2015 with the U.S. Department of Justice, the federal Environmental Protection Agency and the Arkansas Division of Environmental Quality. Fort Smith agreed to repair and upgrade its sewer system after decades of sewage runoff into local waterways, including the Arkansas River. The city agreed to spend more than $200 million over the next 12 years to upgrade its sewer collection and treatment. The original decree deadline was Jan. 2, 2027, but the city said it couldn't afford to do all of the work by that date. The city was granted a five-year extension to 2032. McGill said through the consent decree work the city has built a good relationship with the Environmental Protection Agency to make sure Fort Smith can meet the needs of its residents. McGill said Chaffee Crossing is preparing to be the crossroads for America with the new section of Interstate 49 connecting it to Interstate 40 at Alma and the widening and expansion of Arkansas 255. The Arkansas Good Roads Foundation and the Arkansas Department of Transportation co-hosted a meeting in the summer to inform highway commissioners about the economic impact the extension of I-49 will have. The new section of I-49 will be built in phases and is expected to be four lanes and nearly 14 miles long, costing an estimated $800 million, according to the Department of Transportation. A new 7,800-foot bridge over the Arkansas River is priced at $250 million. Lorie Tudor, director of the Transportation Department, said during the meeting the bridge is the first phase of construction and will begin in 2024. The entire project is expected to be completed by 2030. Ward 3 City Director Lavon Morton said he agrees with McGill the city is in a good position and that he thinks Fort Smith has a very bright future. "There's a lot of construction going on. We have job openings all over the city. We need more workers. People have said that. The mayor said that. Fort Smith has an advantage that the cost of living here is lower than other metropolitan areas in the state. There are many other good attributes that Fort Smith has that put us in a very good position going forward," he said. McGill said in 2023, the city plans to tackle the challenges it's faced for several years and make decisions to improve Fort Smith's future. "Things that may not pay off tomorrow or next month or next year, but we're going to stay ahead of the curve and make those hard choices and make sure our future is secure," he said. "That means making sure we have adequate water supply. That's making sure that our police and fire departments have the very best equipment and very best training available. And when problems arise, we won't panic. We will not panic. We'll collect our thoughts and be the professionals we are."

         FORT SMITH -- The School Board put the brakes on possibly changing where Barling Elementary School students will attend high school, despite survey data showing the idea's apparent popularity. The board voted 5-2 Monday to table discussion of a proposed rezoning of the attendance area for Barling Elementary until October. The proposal would have made it so students who live in the attendance area eventually attend Fort Smith's Southside High School, as opposed to Northside High School. Board members Phil Whiteaker and Dalton Person, who represent district zones 1 and 5 respectively, voted against the tabling. The board's decision to delay action came after it voted 5-2 against a proposal Person made to phase in the rezoning starting with the ninth grade during the 2024-25 academic year. Grades 10-12 would have been added one at a time in the following years, with the district providing bus transportation to Southside for the students involved. The board will have a "snapshot" of district enrollment for the 2023-24 school year by mid-October. Board president Dee Blackwell, representing Zone 3, said the board may also discuss the zoning of the district at large that month. Most Barling students attend Chaffin Middle School before attending Northside. This is despite Barling being in Southside's attendance area and geographically closer to that high school by road-- 6.6 miles from Barling Elementary versus 6.9 miles between Northside and Barling. Marty Mahan, the district's deputy superintendent, said this originated from the district having just one high school when Barling was annexed into it. High School Growth Northside had 2,497 students enrolled compared to Southside's 1,794 in the 2021-22 school year. The current school year has seen Northside's enrollment surpass Southside's by about 477 students -- 2,433 over 1,956. Northside and Southside high schools' maximum capacities are nearly the same -- 2,787 and 2,739, respectively. Both schools were expanded to include freshmen in the 2021-22 school year.   A 10-year enrollment projection shows Northside will continue to have more students than Southside going forward if Barling was shifted to Southside, but the difference each school year would be smaller than if the attendance zones remain the same. Mahan said in response to a question from Blackwell these projections don't take school choice into account. There are 109 Barling students currently going to Southside through attendance area exceptions or other factors, while 104 go to Northside per the current attendance area. In terms of transportation, the district serves Barling with three buses that carry Northside and Chaffin Middle School students. A total combined average of 115 students ride the buses to Northside or Chaffin, with about 50 being Northside students. The district doesn't provide bus transportation for the Barling students at Southside. Community input and discussion The district hosted a community input meeting on the potential rezoning at Barling Elementary on Feb. 6. It gave the Barling city directors a presentation on the subject Feb. 15. The district also sent an online survey to Barling Elementary School and Chaffin Middle School families to gauge their opinions on the proposed attendance area rezoning, according to Mahan. The survey showed out of the 112 people who responded, 81 were in favor of the proposal while 26 were against it; three people had no opinion on it while the remaining two wanted to be free to choose between Southside and Northside. Mahan said 71% of the respondents reported living in the Barling attendance area while the rest did not. Twenty-three respondents, or 20.5%, reported not having children enrolled in the district. Person said while he believed the proposed rezoning wouldn't make a significant difference in addressing the disparity between Southside and Northside enrollments given the number of Barling students who already attend Southside, he was surprised to learn through the survey responses the Barling community seems to support it. Barling Mayor Greg Murray said Wednesday he supports the rezoning as both a Barling resident and parent with a child in the district. This is due to the fact Southside is closer to Barling than Northside, and the rezoning would allow students who grew up in Barling to attend the same high school with the friends they met in middle school without being separated. School choice would also continue to be an option. Murray said while he understands everyone has an opinion on the proposal and Northside has been Barling's default high school since the city began, times have changed. "Barling is growing, and Fort Smith is growing," Murray said. "I applaud the FSSD for allowing students and parents to be able to have a choice of which high school they could go to. However, we are now at a time where if we do not make some sort of move to correct the possible overcrowding issue in the future, then there will be no high school choice." Terry Morawski, district superintendent, told the board the district is unsure of the impact the Arkansas LEARNS Act would have on school choice. Morawski also expects Haas Hall Academy will affect the district's enrollment at the high school level. Haas Hall is an open-enrollment, public charter school encompassing grades 7-12. It's opening a campus in Fort Smith this fall. Talicia Richardson, a School Board member representing Zone 4, said the board voting to phase in the rezoning as Person proposed would be premature until it has more "real data" based on August enrollment numbers. Murray said the board tabling discussion until October is a good idea, allowing the district more time to gather information and make the correct decision.  Future growth Barling Elementary School's enrollment is predicted to steadily increase to 435 students by the 2032-33 school year. The school's official enrollment for the 2022-23 year as of Oct. 1 is 332. Barling Elementary has a maximum capacity of 596 students.

         A Scott County man died in flooding near Waldron, according to a press release from the Scott County Sheriff's Office. The Sheriff's Office reports it was alerted early Friday morning that the man was supposed to meet his grandson on Manorcrest Road but had never arrived and had not returned home. Deputies searched the area and tried to track the man's cellphone, but both efforts proved unsuccessful. After water levels began to recede later that morning, a motorist traveling on Arkansas 248 reported the top of a pickup visible in the Poteau River, according to the release. Deputies and other first responders went to the area and discovered a heavily damaged truck unoccupied and mostly submerged. Upon searching the area, first responders found the man's body a short distance from the truck just before 8 a.m., the release says. The Sheriff's Office said the initial investigation indicates the truck was likely swept from the road and into the river near Arkansas 80 and Manorcrest Road. The man's identity is not being released at this time.  Print Headline: Scott County man dies in flooding Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        A Summit Utilities Inc. customer in Arkansas has sued the natural gas supplier, claiming price gouging and mismanagement of monthly billing procedures. The lawsuit was filed Thursday in Pulaski County Circuit Court on behalf of Little Rock resident Robert Weyrens and all 425,000 Summit customers in Arkansas. Thousands of the utility's Arkansas customers have already lodged similar criticisms of Summit's billing. The lawsuit seeks court approval to review the company's billing procedures and correct errors, according to Little Rock attorney Scott Poynter, who filed the suit. "We need to identify all the problems and then figure out how to solve those problems," Poynter said Friday. Summit, based in Colorado, purchased the natural gas distribution system in Arkansas from CenterPoint Energy Resources Corp. in April 2021 and completed a conversion of ratepayers to its system in December 2022, according to the suit, which has been assigned to Circuit Judge LaTonya Austin Honorable. "Since then, Summit has utterly failed to appropriately provide utility gas service to its customers in Arkansas, and moreover, has price-gouged them with substantial over-billing, and further manipulated their billing methodology," the suit says. Summit has established a billing system that is confusing customers by not clearly stating new monthly charges and improperly accounting for prior payments, Poynter said. "The system is a complete mess," he said. The suit says customers have complained that "their gas bills with Summit have skyrocketed by several times their normal average" since January. "Folks are saying their bills have at least doubled and I'm seeing triple and I'm seeing quadruple," Poynter said. "This is a problem with Summit and the integration of their systems and ... it looks like price gouging." Summit declined to comment on specifics of the suit but said it continues to work directly with customers to resolve problems. "Many of the complaints received seem to be related to the high commodity cost of gas," Brian Bowen, Summit's director of external affairs, said in a statement Friday. Prices to buy on the open market for a cubic foot of gas are up from 38 cents per cubic foot in 2020 to $1.22 today, Bowen said. Customer complaints against Summit have cited soaring monthly charges and poor handling of billing and payments since the company began conversion to its systems from CenterPoint in November 2022. And they're not slowing down. For example, Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin's office reported about 650 customer complaints had been received by Feb. 1. That number has grown to 2,500 complaints, the office reported Friday. Likewise, complaints against Summit filed with the Arkansas Public Service Commission have surged since the utility took over billing. Also on Feb.1, the Public Service Commission reported about 250 billing complaints filed by Summit customers. That ballooned to 615 by Friday. While Summit contends natural gas pricing on the open market is largely responsible for the billing increases, there have been few complaints from customers of the four other providers in Arkansas. The attorney general reports five complaints filed since Nov. 1 -- all against Black Hills Energy, which serves Northwest Arkansas. The commission reports 18 total complaints -- 10 related to Black Hills and eight against Arkansas Oklahoma Gas Corp., which serves western Arkansas. Poynter said his office has received 364 customer complaints since news of the lawsuit was first publicized Thursday. The Public Service Commission could open a docket to examine Summit's billing, though it has not done so. "The Commission is currently assisting customers with complaints and continues to investigate the issues," spokesman Jeff Hilton said Friday. "No decision has been made at this time on whether a formal docket will be opened." Summit, Poynter said, has simply bungled the billing conversion process and is overcharging customers. Some customers have been saddled with "thousands of dollars in gas bills" and they're concerned about their ability to pay, he said. "It's almost like it's extortion," he said. Most immediately, Poynter said he will ask Honorable to halt customer disconnections while the case is under review. Exorbitant bills are burdening customers and stirring anxiety over keeping their homes heated, Poynter said. "There are people with thousands of dollars in gas bills and they're worried ... they're not going to be able to cook or take a hot shower or keep the heat on if we get another cold snap," he said. Summit said in a notice Friday afternoon that it has suspended disconnections. "In light of our transition to new customer service and billing systems, we voluntarily suspended disconnecting customers and charging late fees last fall," said the notice from Chief Executive Officer Kurt Adams. "That suspension will continue through the winter. Before lifting that suspension, we will give customers ample notice." The notice was emailed to Poynter after this newspaper asked Summit whether it would suspend disconnections. In the email, Adams also said customer issues in Arkansas are related to problems with the billing conversion and market prices. Summit did not respond when asked if the notice was sent to all customers, though it is addressed "To Our Valued Customers." "Complications with the implementation of a new computer system, combined with the unusually high energy costs this winter, have been annoying and frustrating to our customers," Adams said in the notice. He also noted that market prices have declined recently. "As a result, we expect that when we file at the end of this month your cost of gas will come down," the email said. Summit is required to make filings with the Public Service Commission every April 1 and Nov. 1 to outline the cost it pays for gas. Summit said its gas rates are regulated and approved by the Public Service Commission and the charges are passed through to customers at the same cost the utility pays. "As a utility, Summit does not profit from the cost of gas," Adams' note said. "Our customers pay what we pay." Customers also contend that the utility is not properly accounting for payments when they are made and that Summit is registering them for automatic withdrawals that the customers did not approve. "It looks like Summit doesn't know where the money is," Poynter said. Summit did not follow up to requests to respond to those allegations. High bills led Jacksonville resident Gary Standridge to completely shut off his heating system for two weeks in February. He said Friday he was still billed more than $300 for the month. Standridge adjusted his usage after receiving a $366.43 bill for January. "I was just absolutely shocked when I got my January bill," Standridge said Friday. "I can't sustain paying those kinds of prices; nobody can." Despite reducing usage in February, Standridge said his bill for the month was $316. An October 2022 study by the U.S. Energy Information Administration projected natural gas bills for residential users would rise sharply this winter, which it defined as the period from October 2022 through the end of March. "We expect households that use natural gas as the primary space heating fuel will spend about $930 this winter, 28% more than they spent last winter," the study said. "Our forecasted increase in natural gas expenditures is the result of both higher expected prices and consumption." The analysis also projected that residential gas costs in the South would increase 15% this winter. Arkansas residents are protesting their Summit bills exceed those projected cost increases. Summit's pricing "reeks of monetary graft," Jacksonville resident Standridge said in a complaint filed with the attorney general. "Summit Utilities, and whoever is in charge of their pricing, [is] bankrupting all of us with these unsustainable price gouges," Standridge said in a two-page letter. All Summit customers in Arkansas -- unless they choose to opt out -- would be included if the class filing is approved by Honorable. That approval should be simple to gain, according to Poynter. "This is the kind of case that is perfect for a class," Poynter said, noting that his firm has specialized in class-action filings for more than 20 years. Summit owns natural gas distribution and transmission subsidiaries that operate in Arkansas, Colorado, Maine, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas. It operates utilities that serve customers of Arkansas Oklahoma Gas, Colorado Natural Gas, Summit Natural Gas of Maine, Summit Natural Gas of Missouri and Summit Utilities of Arkansas.

         Last year, the Concordia Choir sang at St. Peter's Basilica, their praises filling the Vatican City landmark. This year, they're visiting smaller houses of worship a little closer to home, including Bentonville First United Methodist Church at 7:30 p.m. Tuesday, St. James United Methodist Church in Little Rock at 7:30 p.m. on Wednesday and Fort Smith First United Methodist Church at 7 p.m. March 14. The Tuesday performance will be in collaboration with the choir from Bentonville High School. "We're excited to share the music that we've been rehearsing since August with audiences up and down the United States," said Michael Culloton, the Concordia Choir's conductor for the past three years. "The majority of the program is a sacred program with our roots as a college of the church," he said. There are a few secular selections as well, including a new arrangement of Bob Dylan's "The Times, They Are A-Changin'." Founded by Norwegian immigrants in 1891, Concordia Choir has Evangelical Lutheran ties and a host of ecumenical friends, with stops also scheduled at Episcopal, Presbyterian and United Church of Christ congregations. The 2023 tour began Feb. 25. By the time the choir returns to its Moorhead, Minn., campus March 19, it will have performed in locations from Sioux Falls, S.D., to San Antonio -- eight states in all. Under previous directors, the choir made frequent stops in the Natural State, Culloton said. "I've never been to Arkansas, so this is going to be the maiden voyage for me, personally, but I know that we're going to come and sing for three really awesome audiences who are going to enjoy the work of these young singers immensely," he said. The choir is more than an entertainment source; it's also an effective recruitment tool. Eager for the choir to be heard by young people, Concordia College is allowing students to attend their Arkansas performances free of charge. Adults are charged admission of $20 to $25. "It's been fun for me to know a couple of students who heard the choir in Arkansas and came to study at Concordia, and so we hope for the same thing [this time]," Culloton said. "We have room in our quota for Arkansas students to come study here." Breck Cogswell attended a Concordia Choir concert in Fort Smith in 2013 when she was a self-described "certified choir nerd" at Southside High School. Inspired by the sound, she eventually enrolled at Concordia College. By the time the choir returned to Fort Smith in 2018, she was a member. Now an alumni, she's currently enrolled at Wartburg Theological Seminary in Dubuque, Iowa, preparing to become an ordained Lutheran minister. She's delighted to see Concordia visiting her hometown yet again. "I think it is beyond awesome that the choir makes a point to have Fort Smith on their regular tour cycle, every five years-ish," she said. "[First United Methodist Church] is such a special place, with wonderful acoustics for singing and even more wonderful people who are excited to listen to the tour concert and meet the students every time." Culloton, himself a 1998 Concordia College graduate, says the music conveys a timeless message. The words to many of the songs are lifted from the Bible, with passages borrowed from Psalms, Isaiah and 1 John. The first set includes Felix Mendelssoh's "Warum toben die Heiden" (Why do the nations rage?), J.S. Bach's "Lobet den Herrn, alle Heiden" (Praise the Lord, all ye nations) and Knut Nystedt's "I Will Greatly Rejoice." A subsequent set is devoted to songs extolling the Virgin Mary while another is titled "Of Angels and Alleluias." Some audiences will also hear "Beautiful Savior," a song sung at the Vatican during last year's Italy tour. At the Lutheran school, songs of praise are part of a long tradition. "I like the freedom that comes with working at an institution where we can unabashedly sing sacred music," Culloton said. "I heard a fellow say recently that we preach a changeless Christ for a changing world and I thought, 'That's great. We sing of a changeless Christ for a changing world.'"

        BENTONVILLE -- A lieutenant resigned from the Bentonville Police Department after his arrest in connection with driving while intoxicated. Joseph Luke Rosebaugh, 38, of Gravette, was arrested Wednesday in connection with driving while intoxicated and refusal to submit to a chemical test, according to Cindy Murphy, a spokeswoman for the Arkansas State Police. Adam McInnis, a spokesman for Bentonville police, confirmed Friday that Rosebaugh resigned from the department. Rosebaugh was arrested after the State Police responded to a 7:37 a.m. Wednesday call to Arkansas 102 at Rebel Road. Murphy said the call was in response to a suspicious person. He was booked into the Benton County Jail at 10:54 a.m. Wednesday and released on citation at 11:33 a.m. that day, according to jail records. His arraignment is scheduled for 10 a.m. May 10 in district court in Gentry.  Print Headline: Officer resigns after DWI arrest Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         PEA RIDGE -- The City Council recently passed a resolution to get the rates charged for ambulance service provided by the Pea Ridge Fire-EMS Department more in line with other ambulance service providers in Benton County. Saying that a city-operated ambulance department is never going to make money, interim Fire Chief Clint Bowen presented a request to the City Council during a work session Feb. 21 to change the rates for the Pea Ridge Fire-EMS Department. "Fire, police, ambulance -- I think the Water Department may be the only department that makes money -- will never be for profit," Bowen said. "We are an advertisement for the type of service you get if you come to the city." "Nationally, fire, police, street departments are not for profit," he said. "Long story short, I had an unofficial committee look at all the billing in Northwest Arkansas. We try to be on par," he said, adding that it is extremely difficult to consider the rates from Northeast Benton County Volunteer Fire-EMS Department as it's not a municipal service. He said that the Pea Ridge rates were too high. Bowen said there were multiples times within about six weeks that there were ambulances from other departments inside the city limits because Pea Ridge ambulance was already busy on a call. He said it didn't seem right to him that the person being served by the out-of-city ambulance would get a lower bill. "What I have asked for here is to get on the same page as NEBCO and Rogers," Bowen said. He presented a chart to council members comparing rates of Bella Vista, Bentonville, Central EMS, Lowell, NEBCO, Pea Ridge, Rogers, Siloam Springs and Springdale. "I've been in the industry for 25 years. It's always been a service," he said. Several specific cases were also brought up concerning walk-ins and other unique situations. Bowen said he is addressing that. Council member Nadine Telgemeier asked: "Will these charges cover our expenses?" "No," Bowen said. "It's never going to," Bowen said. "I don't ever want the career that I love to be a legality. I want to treat people with kindness," he said. During the council meeting that followed the work session, council members unanimously approved a resolution adjusting rates and charges for the ambulance service. The resolution states the rates shall be set "commensurate with elect other ambulance services in Benton County, Ark." It allows for rates to be reevaluated every two years and adjusted as necessary.

        More than 50 transgender rights advocates gathered in front of the Arkansas Capitol on Friday to protest a bill that aims to make it a crime for a person to knowingly remain in a bathroom of the opposite sex while a minor is present. Protesters sang, heard from speakers and demonstrated against Senate Bill 270, which some opponents have said would create the most extreme anti-transgender law in America if enacted. At one point, demonstrators placed pieces of toilet paper bearing photos of lawmakers in a wastebasket decorated as a toilet to express their opposition. "What do we do with transphobia," asked Tien Estell, advocacy coordinator for Intransitive Arkansas, while leading a chant. "Flush it down," responded the crowd. The bill's sponsor, Sen. John Payton, R-Wilburn, has said the measure is needed to protect children. Payton told the Senate on Wednesday he considers the legislation to be a compromise and noted it would cover "transgender" and "heterosexual" people. "The bottom line is this bill does not make it illegal for somebody to use the wrong bathroom if it does not match up with their sex unless there is a child present," he said. Sarah Everett, policy director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas, told demonstrators Friday that her organization would keep up its opposition to the bill. "We at the ACLU of Arkansas with all of you will do everything in our power to prevent this from becoming law and, if it does, to prevent it from taking effect," she said. "We're not going anywhere." While speaking against the bill during a meeting of the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this week , Everett said no other state has a criminal ban against transgender people using restrooms. Five people spoke against the bill and one testified in favor of it during the meeting. After the panel advanced the legislation, Payton pulled it from the Senate floor Wednesday to address a drafting error. The bill is scheduled to reappear in the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday. Ally Thomlinson, with Disability Rights Arkansas, urged demonstrators to participate in the legislative process. "You are the experts on the trans experience," Thomlinson said. Payton's bill would generally criminalize instances where a person 18 or older knowingly "enters into and remains in a public changing facility that is assigned to persons of the opposite sex while knowing a minor of the opposite sex is present in the public changing facility." It includes exemptions for parents accompanying minors, people rendering medical assistance, law enforcement officials accompanying a person in their custody and people authorized to maintain and inspect facilities. Along with Payton's bill, lawmakers have reviewed at least one other bill which opponents say could affect bathroom access for transgender people. House Bill 1156, by Rep. Mary Bentley, R-Perryville, would require public schools and open enrollment public charter schools to designate multiple occupancy restrooms for the exclusive use of either the male or female sex. Bentley's bill was pulled from the Senate floor earlier this month to allow for amendment. It has since been referred to the Senate Committee on Education. The American Civil Liberties Union is tracking at least six pieces of legislation in other states which could impact access to facilities including public restrooms and locker rooms, according to the organization's website.

        ASHDOWN — Cloudy skies and a cold wind could not dampen the sense of pride and achievement for Little River County officials Friday as Sheriff Bobby Walraven cut the ribbon on the new jail. “Its a very important moment for the Little River sheriffs office. Its a testament of the support our citizens have for law enforcement. This has been a long, long project, and its long overdue,” Walraven said. Construction on the detention center had several delays due to supply chain issues and wet weather. Work on the outside of the building and the parking lot were the final steps in getting the facility complete, Walraven said. Little River County voters approved a bond in September 2019 to finance the new building and a three-eighths-cent sales tax to help pay for it and a quarter-cent tax for maintenance and operation. The measures went into effect Jan. 1, 2020. The new jail is on U.S. 71 on the north side of Ashdown near Cossatot Community College University of Arkansas. Officials looked at four locations before deciding on the site. The Southbuild Team, which includes Spirit Architecture Group and Smith-Doyle Contractors, constructed the jail. The new jail can house between 60 and 80 inmates. Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         Sanctions of $516,850 imposed on the owner of a Springdale drugstore found to have violated Arkansas drug-prescription regulations will stand, Pulaski County Circuit Judge Herb Wright ruled on Tuesday, rejecting the Florida man's appeal of the penalties imposed by state pharmacy regulators. "[T]he Arkansas State Board of Pharmacy ... decision was supported by substantial evidence," Wright stated in his one-page decision, affirming the findings and fines. In August 2021, the board found that Italo Solari of Boca Raton, Fla., had acquired a pharmacy license for the White River Pharmacy LLC under false pretenses and ran the pharmacy "in a manner to endanger public health." Among 18 violations of state law and pharmacy regulations, the board also determined that Solari breached rules by reusing returned prescription drugs, filling prescriptions from an unlicensed doctor, failing to confirm the legitimacy of prescriptions and billing insurance for prescriptions that were not asked for or never received by patients. Solari, who did not attend the board's hearing, was fined $498,100, ordered to pay $18,750 in investigative costs and barred from owning any facility that is regulated by the pharmacy board. Solari denied wrongdoing and appealed the sanctions to court under the Administrative Procedure Act, arguing that pharmacy regulators incorrectly penalized Solari for his ownership role in White River at 7321 W. Sunset Ave. when he was not personally involved in either its management or its daily operations. Represented by Little Rock attorney Darren O'Quinn, Solari argued that the board had ignored "well-established" state law that differentiates between companies and their shareholders/members. O'Quinn urged the judge to overturn the findings against Solari under new standards set in 2020 by the Arkansas Supreme Court that grant a "fresh review" of the outcome. Previously, the courts were required to give great deference to agency findings unless the court determined that outcome was "clearly wrong." The board's attorney told the judge that Solari's actions and involvement as a permit holder, not the owner, were the issue. "The evidence ... clearly shows that Petitioner Solari's actions constituted violations of Arkansas pharmacy laws and regulations," Ashley Vailes, the board's general counsel, asserted. "Solari as a holder of a permit to operate as an Arkansas pharmacy violated the Arkansas laws regarding pharmacy and board regulations. This is undisputed, and this alone is substantial evidence to support the board's decision." The board's findings showed that White River: 1) Shipped prescription medication to states where it did not have a pharmacy license. 2) Did not have valid patient/prescriber relationships because it had either no or little communications with providers or most patients. 3) Possessed blank pre-signed prescriptions without patient information 4) Accepted 13 prescriptions authorized by Dr. Darrel Rinehart of Tennessee between December 2019 and April 2020 after his license had been suspended. In 2021, Rinehart was sentenced to three years in federal prison in Tennessee for illegally providing medications, primarily opioids, in 2015 to four patients who did not need them. 5) Filled 1,065 prescriptions for Dr. Ananda de Silva of Missouri between September 2019 and April 2020 despite being unable to show evidence it had contact with him. 6) Removed the labels of some returned medications, blacked out the name of the previous patient, then sent them out again to other patients. 7) Employed pharmacist Tammy Bitzer who was "unfit or incompetent" to be a pharmacist due to "negligent performance" of her duties.

         For more than two decades, when the House of Windsor needed music for royal occasions, James O'Donnell was there to ensure flawless, majestic performances. Since January, however, he has been based in New Haven, Conn., where he serves as a professor in the Yale School of Music and Yale Institute of Sacred Music. Next week, the former organist and master of the choristers at Westminster Abbey is coming to Arkansas' capital city for a residency at Trinity Episcopal Cathedral. On Thursday and March 11, O'Donnell will lead Trinity's choir rehearsals. At 7 p.m. Friday, he'll deliver a public lecture. On March 12, he'll conduct the choir at the 10:30 a.m. Choral Eucharist and the 4 p.m. Evensong, playing its postlude before attending a closing reception. "I think this is going to be a unique and historic event here in Little Rock and, in fact, the whole region," said Colin MacKnight, the cathedral's director of music. Trinity Cathedral, the seat of the Episcopal bishop of Arkansas, was built in 1884. Westminster Abbey was begun by Benedictine monks in about 960. The Abbey is a royal church, a stone's throw from Parliament on the north side of the Thames. Queen Elizabeth I is among those buried there. During his tenure, O'Donnell, 61, witnessed history again and again. "He was the music director for lots of important occasions, including Queen Elizabeth's funeral and the wedding of William and Kate [now the Prince and Princess of Wales]. Important moments in the British monarchy, plus," MacKnight said. On top of that, he oversaw the "regular regimen of daily choral services, concert tours, broadcasts and recordings," MacKnight said, adding, "He's really one of the top, top people in sacred music alive today." A native of Scotland, O'Donnell was an organ scholar at Cambridge University's Jesus College, graduating in 1982. Initially, he worked at Westminster Cathedral, seat of the Catholic archbishop of Westminster, first as assistant master of music (1982-1988), then as master of music. While he was there, the Westminster Cathedral Choir won the 1998 Gramophone Award for Record of the Year for its recording of Frank Martin's Mass for Double Choir and Ildebrando Pizzetti's Requiem. "[It] was the only time that any cathedral choir had ever won it, so that was quite a feather in our cap and it was great to have that kind of general musical recognition," O'Donnell said. In 1999, he was chosen to be the Abbey's organist and master of choristers, the first Catholic to fill the role since the Reformation. At the Abbey, O'Donnell's skills impressed clergy and royalty alike. On multiple occasions, he was presented to the queen. The interactions were brief but lovely, he said. "It was always a thrill to do it," he said. "She was wonderful, I thought. She was great. She was always very smiley and very pleasant and very relaxed, but I rarely had more than a few words with her," he said. The feedback, when he received it, was positive. In April, when O'Donnell announced he was headed to New England, the dean of Westminster, the Very Rev. Dr. David Hoyle, used superlatives to describe his tenure. "In Westminster Abbey we strive for excellence. That is a difficult thing to deliver; it is a hard discipline. Yet, for 23 years, it is precisely what James O'Donnell has given us," Hoyle said. Expressing "profound admiration" for O'Donnell's "breath-taking and sustained achievement," Hoyle concluded: "We have been privileged to listen to the music he has made. Yale [has] chosen well. He has given glory to God." O'Donnell was returning from a visit to the Ivy League school on the day that the queen died. "I was at the airport already when I heard that there was going to be an announcement about her health but they didn't say anything more," he said. "I heard the culmination of the news as I landed in London, some some hours later." The days that followed were busy. "I felt very, very privileged to be directing the music for Her Majesty's funeral," he said. In addition to directing the Choir of Westminster Abbey and the Choir of the Chapel Royal, St James' Palace, he also did the arrangements for two of the hymns that were sung: "The Day Thou Gavest, Lord, Is Ended'' and "Love Divine, All Loves Excelling.'' In the Abbey and all around it, multitudes turned out to pay their respects. "I think she was definitely held in great affection and you got a sense of that during the funeral," O'Donnell said. "It felt like an act of farewell and thanksgiving for a wonderful person, not just a state occasion with formality. It had a real sort of human aspect to it, which was quite tangible." O'Donnell's service to the queen was appreciated by the royal family. Over the holidays, King Charles III named O'Donnell as a lieutenant in the Royal Victorian Order, an award for those who have provided the sovereign with distinguished service. O'Donnell, who gave an organ concert at Pulaski Heights United Methodist Church in 2012, said he's glad to be returning to Arkansas. "I much enjoyed Little Rock. I'm looking forward to it," he said. If you go: James O'Donnell will appear at Trinity Cathedral, 310 W. 17th St., Little Rock, Friday and March 12.
