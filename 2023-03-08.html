        Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed her education overhaul, known as the Arkansas LEARNS Act, into law shortly before 12:30 p.m. on Wednesday. Watch the signing here:  [Video not showing? Click here to watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QLYz8ze7fE] “When I put my signature on this bill and make it law, the failed status quo will end,” Sanders said during the signing. 7:05 a.m. Sanders education bill passes Senate, heads to governors desk The Arkansas Senate approved Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders' education overhaul Tuesday, sending the bill to the governor's desk for her signature. The Senate voted 26-8 to approve Senate Bill 294, also known as the LEARNS Act, after it was amended last week in the House of Representatives. While the Senate approved the bill Feb. 23, the chamber voted on the bill again Tuesday to concur with an amendment the House made last week. Sanders said in a statement shortly after Tuesday's vote she will sign the bill into law during a ceremony at noon today at the Capitol. "Today's final passage of the biggest, boldest, most conservative education reforms in America makes Arkansas a blueprint for the country," Sanders said in a release. "Arkansas LEARNS will raise teacher pay, empower parents, and give our students the skills to succeed in life. These changes can't come soon enough." The bill is the Republican governor's signature education legislation that calls for school vouchers, a $14,000 raise in the starting salary for teachers, a dual diploma for high school students learning a trade, and a repeal of the Teacher Fair Dismissal Act, making it easier for school districts to fire teachers for poor performance. The bill passed the House and Senate with an emergency clause, which means it can take effect immediately. Since taking office in January, Sanders has said education will be her top priority as governor, saying she wanted to put an end to a system where students were trapped in failing schools because of their zip code. The most contentious part of Sanders' 145-page education bill is the voucher program, called Educational Savings Accounts. Sen. Fred Love, D-Mabelvale, said the bill could mean increased racial segregation, pointing to use of vouchers after the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark 1954 Brown v. Board ruling, ending legal school segregation. "The best predictor of future behavior is past behavior," Love said. "Am I saying people are trying to segregate schools? No, but the result was we segregated school." The bill would tie education funding to students, giving them 90% of what schools get per student in state funding from the previous school year to attend a private or home school, which would currently amount to $6,672. The legislation also calls for a new minimum starting salary of $50,000 a year for teachers, which would rank Arkansas among the highest in the country for minimum teacher pay. "For far too long, Arkansas has languished at the bottom of national education rankings, but that begins to change today," said Laurie Lee, chairman of The Reform Alliance, in a news release. "This expansive investment in education to enact the bold vision of Gov. Sanders will be a turning point for our state, and I would hope to see it embraced." The Educational Freedom Account will be phased in over three years beginning with the 2023-2024 school year. Students who are enrolled at F-rated schools; who are enrolled in kindergarten; who were or are in a foster care program; who have a disability; or who have an active-duty military parent would be given first priority. In the following school year, students who are enrolled in a D-rated school; who have a parent who is a military veteran; or who are children of first-responders will become eligible for an Educational Freedom Account. By the 2025-2026 school year, every student who is eligible to enroll in a public school will be eligible for a voucher to attend a private or home school. The bill was amended to add an "opportunity for a hearing" and notice before a teacher is terminated after the bill would repeal the Teacher Fair Dismissal Act, a law that requires school districts to notify teachers of changes in their employment status before May 1 each year. The amendment also calls for school districts to adopt a salary schedule for teachers and prevent school safety plans from being subject to public records requests. As part of the package teachers making above the proposed new minimum will receive $2,000 raises and could earn a bonus of up to $10,000 for earning high marks or being willing to teach in geographic areas or teach subject matter that is in high demand. Many teachers spoke against the bill during its two public hearings with many arguing that an end to the Teacher Fair Dismissal Act would end critical labor protections for teachers. Others said the bill's repeal of a recommended salary schedule would hurt experienced teachers who are rewarded for experience. While teachers must be given notice and a hearing before they can be fired, that does not apply when a school district opts not to renew a teacher's contract, said Sen. Breanne Davis, the bill's sponsor. Some have criticized the bill's sponsor for what they perceived to be a rushed process that did not include enough input from other lawmakers or teachers and superintendents. "This bill was pushed through the Legislature at an unprecedented speed and our children are going to suffer because of it," said Carol Fleming, president of the Arkansas Education Association, in a news release Tuesday. "The law will weaken our public schools and unfairly increase disparities between rural and urban districts. We tried to warn our legislators about the impacts this overhaul would have on our children but they did not listen." In her closing remarks Tuesday, Davis rejected the idea that developing the bill was rushed and did not include enough voices from outside the Legislature. "Hundreds of people and thousands of hours went into writing this bill," Davis said. "This is the most collaborative and comprehensive process that I have been part of, and this is just the beginning of the work." OTHER FEATURES The LEARNS Act also calls for higher literacy standards and resources for students to increase their reading levels. The bill calls for 120 literacy coaches and grants for families to hire tutors to assist students with reading. Students who fail the state Department of Education's reading requirements by the third grade won't be permitted to move on to the fourth grade unless granted an exemption. The bill also requires high schools to offer students a "career ready" pathway for the ninth-grade class by the 2024-2025 year to focus their education on "modern career and technical studies aligned with high-wage, high-growth jobs in Arkansas," as part of a focus on technical education. To help recruit more educators to the profession, the bill creates the "Teacher Academy Scholarship Program" to help cover tuition costs for those studying to become teachers. The bill also increases the state's student loan repayment from $3,000 to $6,00 per year for teachers with student debt. The LEARNS Act also codifies Sanders' executive order banning Critical Race Theory and other "prohibited indoctrination," asking the Department of Education to review any materials, policies or rules that promote the teaching the of theory. In the wake of recent school shootings, the bill codifies some recommendations from the Arkansas School Safety Commission, specifically calling for schools to have a comprehensive school safety assessment and to work with law enforcement to improve security. COSTS The total cost of the LEARNS Act will be $297.5 million in the first year, with $150 million of that coming in the form of new spending, according to a fiscal analysis by the Arkansas Department of Education. In the second year, as more students become eligible for the state's school voucher program, the cost would increase to $343.3 million, including $250 million in new funding. The increased pay for teachers will cost the state $180 million each year, according to the Department of Education. The Educational Freedom Accounts will cost $46.7 million in the first year and $97.5 in the second year. In the third year, Robert Brech, deputy director of budget at the Department of Finance and Administration, said the program will cost the state an estimated $175 million. Two Republican, Senators Jimmy Hickey Jr., of Texarkana and Bryan King of Green Forrest, along with the six Democrats voted against the bill. King said he voted against the bill because of a concern over its "long-term costs." "If you are going to be increasing spending, right, then you need to be decreasing spending somewhere else," King said. King said he supports vouchers, but said he would prefer they come in the form of scholarships for students who score high on standardized tests.

        The Arkansas Senate on Tuesday narrowly approved a bill that would create criminal penalties for knowingly entering and remaining in a bathroom of the opposite sex while a minor is present. With six senators not voting and a senator voting present, the Senate voted 19-7 to send Senate Bill 270 by Sen. John Payton, R-Wilburn, to the House for further consideration. Eighteen votes are required in the 35-member Senate for approval of a bill. The Senate's approval of the bill came a day after the Senate Committee on Judiciary endorsed the bill for the second time after amending it. The bill cleared the Senate committee last week before the Senate voted to send it to the committee to fix a drafting error in the bill. Payton told senators that sending the bill back to the Senate committee was a pretty healthy process because "it gave us a chance to point out that this bill does not do near as much as what it is credited to be doing. "To me, this was quite the compromise," he said. Payton said the bill would a very high bar for prosecution. "It is going to be very hard to prove," he said. "Somebody really is going to have to act out and be obnoxious and be a problem before any prosecutor would pursue such a high bar, and they are going to have a lot of proof in order to gain a conviction in this," Payton said. The bill comes amid a flood of bills across states addressing transgender issues. So far this year, at least 155 such measures have been introduced, according to the Human Rights Campaign. Opponents have contended that SB70 would create the most extreme bathroom ban in the nation if enacted and could lead to the prosecution of transgender people for using public restrooms while doing little to protect minors from sexual indecency. The legislation goes even further than a North Carolina bathroom law that was enacted in 2016 and later repealed following widespread boycotts and protests. That law did not include any criminal penalties. Sen. Clarke Tucker, D-Little Rock, said there is no other crime on the books that has a physical trait of a person's body as an element of the crime. "It is about proving what a person's gender was when they were born," he said. 'They might have to bring on an expert witness to prove beyond a reasonable doubt whether a person has a penis or a vagina when they were born. It is really truly bizarre for that to be in a crime. It doesn't exist in any other crime in the state of Arkansas." Tucker said the bill regulates property of private businesses. "Every other crime that we have on the books requires harm to the victim," he said. "This would also be unprecedented since it doesn't actually require any harm to a victim." Sen. Joshua Bryant, R-Rogers, told senators that "I think it is an overreach of what our responsibility is." "This bill makes a simple occupation of somebody walking into a facility of the opposite sex a misdemeanor act," he said. He said there are numerous medical issues, such as Crohn's disease, that could cause a person to occupy a restroom of the opposite sex. "There are times to be statesmen and times to be politicians, and this issue requires to be statesmen," Bryant said. But Payton told senators "the bottom line is this bill is in response to the changes in society. "It is not trying to drag us back," he said. The legislation would create a criminal penalty for a person 18 or older who knowingly "enters into and remains in a public changing facility that is assigned to persons of the opposite sex while knowing a minor of the opposite sex is present in the public changing facility." A person who violates this section of the code would be guilty of a Class C misdemeanor. The bill defines a "public changing facility" as a public or private facility "held out as open to the public and designed to be used at a time during which a person may be in a state of undress in the presence of other persons." These facilities include "without limitation a restroom, bathroom, locker room, or shower room." The term covers "a private dressing area open to the public that is designed for changing into and out of clothing that is for sale in a commercial establishment that engages in the sale of clothing." A person's sex as defined by the legislation is their "immutable biological sex as objectively determined by anatomy and genetics existing at the time of birth." During the committee meeting Monday, Tucker questioned how prosecutors would verify a person's sex and enforce the law. Prosecutor coordinator Bob McMahan said a prosecutor could potentially use search warrants, subpoenaed medical records and blood tests to determine a person's sex. Sen. Alan Clark, R-Lonsdale, asked on Monday if any laws exist to prevent people from using bathrooms of the opposite sex. McMahan said he was not aware of statutes that would prohibit this. "With what people want to be the new norms, we seem to have opened a can of worms," Clark said. Among other exceptions, the bill provides exemptions for parents accompanying minors, people rendering medical assistance, law enforcement officials accompanying a person in their custody and people authorized to maintain and inspect facilities.

         SPRINGDALE -- The Planning Commission on Tuesday voted 9-0 to approve a new water tower for west Springdale, designed to serve the area's needs into 2045. Springdale Water Utilities will build a 130-foot, 3 million-gallon tank at 2338 S. 40th St., behind the First Church of the Nazarene. The tower is part of a bigger project to deliver water to the western parts of the city, said Heath Ward, executive director of the water utility. The utility also will install two 48-inch pressurized pipelines to carry water from the west side pumping station planned along Arkansas 612 by the Beaver Water District. Utility officials said the project is essential to cover the potable water needs of the growing city. Some residents in the southwest area already experience lower water pressure from time to time, Ward said. The utility 44 years ag0, in 1979, bought the property with plans to erect a water tower on it as the city grew and its service was needed, Ward said. Two couples who said their homes and lots abut the utility's lot came to the meeting, but did not speak before the commission. A couple living on South 43rd Street, who declined to share their names, was concerned about where those two water mains would be built. Rick Pulvirenti, chief operating officer and engineer for the water utility, said the pipes for carrying the water to the tower are in place. They will connect with the two water mains at Elm Springs Road. Wayne Terry, who lives on Chapman Avenue, said he knew that if the tower fell during a tornado, its 130-foot length would not reach any structures. "But it would cause a big mess," he said. Terry said he and wife Gaye have lived in their home for 42 years. Brad Hammond, an engineer with Olsson firm in Fayetteville, said the tower will meet high standards for wind and seismic activity and codes for water towers. He said the tower would be less likely to fall when it is full, which is how the utility plans to keep it. Pulvirenti said the tank wouldn't make noise nor would it smell once construction is completed. Water is stored in elevated tanks, which use gravity to keep pipe mains below ground full and pressures high. Especially in times of peak use, the extra water held in the tower will ensure water for everyone. When demand slacks, the station quickly pumps the tower full again and ready for the next peak. The utility also had asked for landscaping variances at the tower site, but agreed to upgrading fencing and building a 5-foot sidewalk along the utility's access drive. Pulvirenti said the cost of the project currently is estimated at $52.3 million. Patsy Christie, director of the city's Planning Department, noted a cell tower stands behind the church and will remain. It looks like a tall white cross, she said.

         FAYETTEVILLE -- The City Council held off on a decision to provide pandemic relief money to a nonprofit for permanent supportive housing for unsheltered residents after having questions about federal regulations, dollar amounts and other comparable proposals. The vote Tuesday was 8-0 to hold a proposal until April 18 sponsored by council members Sarah Moore and D'Andre Jones. The proposal would provide New Beginnings, a nonprofit that operates a microshelter community on 19th Street, with nearly $1.3 million in American Rescue Plan money. The money would enable New Beginnings to buy homes and lease them with case management services provided to unsheltered residents, a practice known as permanent supportive housing. Solomon Burchfield, New Beginnings director, said clients at the community are hitting a wall. Some are ready to move out but can't find affordable housing. The proposal would house six to eight people annually, he said. Burchfield accounted for attrition, such as people moving, passing away or exiting the program, and said the proposal could house 30 people over 30 years. The council had questions about using the federal relief money to impact the most people in the most effective way. The city was awarded $17.9 million in American Rescue Plan money and has about $1.7 million left. Moore said although the proposal may only house six to eight people annually, it would reduce other indirect taxpayer costs such as emergency services and incarceration typically associated with vulnerable populations. The proposal also presents a permanent, rather than temporary, solution for people who may have no other options, she said. Nearly 20 people spoke to the council in support. Some were current or former clients of New Beginnings, who said the community has enabled them to get on their feet and out of living outdoors. Some of those who spoke said they were ready to leave New Beginnings but cannot find a place to live in the city, whether because they can't afford it, landlords won't accept them or because there is a lack of housing supply. Several council members had concerns about whether the proposal would meet federal requirements. Steven Dotson, the city's internal auditor, said the federal government has additional rules for capital projects of more than $1 million. The city would have to prepare a written justification for the expenditure, describe the need it would address and why it would it be preferable against similar alternative proposals. The proposal scored low among other applications for rescue plan money based on the cost-benefit analysis, Dotson said. He said it may prove difficult to show the federal government how the proposal would be preferable over other comparable proposals related to housing. Council member Scott Berna said he had concerns about granting New Beginnings' request while leaving other applications that scored higher on the table. Council member Teresa Turk said she wanted more information about how many people the city could serve with a rental assistance program versus the New Beginnings proposal, as well as more details on the sustainability of the proposal. She proposed reducing the dollar amount to $975,000 to avoid triggering the additional federal requirements. Chief of Staff Susan Norton said staff would provide the council the requested information. In other business, the council approved two items related to pay for employees. One was a new step plan for firefighters and police. Moore voted against while Jones, Berna, Turk, Sonia Harvey, Mike Wiederkehr, Holly Hertzberg and Sarah Bunch voted in favor. The other was to provide a raise to nonuniformed employees, which passed 8-0. Chief Financial Officer Paul Becker said the raises will cost $5.5 million this year and $7.5 million annually in future years using a combination of reserve money and anticipated growth in revenue.  None  Council action Fayetteville's City Council met Tuesday and approved: A $156,812 contract with Ellingson Contracting for continued work at the Woolsey farmstead restoration project.

         Most Northwest Arkansas lawmakers supported the governor's education package while regional school leaders said Tuesday they were taking time to study the measure before commenting. Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders' 144-page education bill covers issues ranging from school safety to taxpayer-funded educational savings accounts that can be used for tutoring, education-related equipment and tuition to private schools. The bill passed the Senate on Tuesday. The governor announced Tuesday she will sign the bill today. The Fayetteville School District's leadership is evaluating the lengthy bill, which was extensively amended Friday before it passed the House, spokesman Alan Wilbourn said Tuesday. The district is also awaiting the implementing rules and regulations before making any comment. The Bentonville, Rogers and Springdale school districts contacted for comment had no immediate reaction to the still-unsigned bill. "In reality this bill passed on Nov. 8, 2022, when Sarah Sanders became governor-elect," said Sen. Jim Dotson, R-Bentonville. Sanders campaigned on the issue of school reform and clearly put the issue first among her campaign priorities, he said. "I've been campaigning on these kind of changes for years," said Dotson, who was first elected to the state House in 2012. "So have a lot of members of the Legislature. Now we have a governor in full support. We didn't just get over the finish line. We accelerated to the finish line." Rep. Kendra Moore, R-Lincoln, served on the Lincoln Consolidated School District board from 2010 until entering the Legislature this year. She also said in an interview earlier this week that the governor's strong support was vital in getting the bill passed -- and a good indicator the governor will continue to push for success on education. "The bill shows that the governor's first priority is education," Moore said. "That's where she's putting the time, the resources and the dollars." The bill authorizes an extensive rule-making process in which the voice of her largely rural district and other districts like it will be heard, Moore said. The governor's office and the state Department of Education leadership convinced her they have a plan and the ability to implement it, she said. "There are a few things in this bill that kept me up at night," Moore said. "But they seem to have a clear path to get us there. They've spent countless hours crunching the numbers." Two Republicans in the Senate and three in the House voted against the measure in votes this week. Tuesday's vote in the Senate was 26-8. Five of the six senators who live in either Benton or Washington counties voted for the bill on Tuesday. All five Northwest Arkansas senators who voted for it co-sponsored the bill. Sen. Greg Leding, D-Fayetteville, was the lone senator from either Benton or Washington counties to vote against the measure on Tuesday. "I fully expect legal challenges," Leding said in a telephone interview Tuesday. Opponents of the bill argue the bill's allowing taxpayer dollars to go to private schools, among other provisions, violates Article 14, Section 1 of the state constitution, which requires the state to "maintain a general, suitable and efficient system of free public schools." "I had a lot of emails from constituents that started with 'I'm a Republican but' or 'I voted for Sarah Sanders but' and went on to object to this bill," Leding said. "This is not a partisan issue. There were Republicans who voted against this bill." Only three Republican lawmakers in the House voted against the bill when it passed that chamber on Thursday in a 78-21 vote. All three Democrats in the Northwest Arkansas House delegation voted against the bill. The only Republican in the Northwest Arkansas delegation to vote against the bill was Rep. Hope Hendren Duke, R-Gravette, who was a member of the Gravette School Board before entering the Legislature. She is serving her first term. The other 14 House members who come from either Benton or Washington counties voted for the bill.

         HIGHFILL -- Northwest Arkansas National Airport is beginning work on a $34 million terminal renovation, but it's also trying not to negatively impact flyers during spring break. A groundbreaking for the terminal improvement project is set for Tuesday after the airport board's regular meeting, but preparations are already underway by the contractor, Nabholz, according to Nick Fondano, chief infrastructure officer. Construction will overtake the front of the building next week, interior and exterior, Fondano said. "We're going to leave the central corridor, or the entrance to the main terminal, open through spring break week because that will be a big rush of pedestrians. But, then post-spring break, the whole front entrance is going to be closed," he said. The drop-off lane in front of the terminal will be closed, the main entrance will be closed and the primary entrances and exits will be the east and west vestibules of the terminal during construction, Fondano said. A temporary wall will be built along the front of the terminal to separate the public from the work. After the renovation, there will be more elevators, escalators and stairwells and new baggage-handling equipment. The federal Transportation Safety Administration and police areas will be renovated. There also will be a host of architectural upgrades, including new paint, terrazzo floors, lighting and sound baffles; a new information desk and a canopy along the front of the terminal covering the drop-off area; and new flight information displays. Construction will be done in several phases, and work is estimated be completed in two years. About $26 million in Federal Aviation Administration grants are being sought to help pay for the work. Airport officials are also discussing whether to get rid of the 55-foot moving sidewalk in the concourse. "This thing is problematic, and it takes up a lot of space," Fondano said. "Currently, it's inoperable and needs repair." Fondano said an evaluation found the moving sidewalk isn't needed to meet Americans with Disabilities Act requirements. He said the walkway breaks down regularly and poses liability issues. "It's not really worth the 55 feet of travel when we also have alternative methods of getting individuals who need assistance to and from the gates," he said. The moving sidewalk was billed as being the first in Arkansas when it was installed more than a decade ago. The walkway has its own Facebook page: "The Only Moving Walkway in the State of Arkansas." Brian Burke, the airport's attorney and a former board member, said the moving walkway was originally a "fix" because the elevation of the concourse was off when it was built and resulted in a slight incline. "I think the real question is do people use it because it's there or do they use it because they need to use it," Burke said. Board members informally agreed staff should explore the option of removing the walkway and using the area for something else, such as additional seating, vending or a coffee kiosk. Fondano said one potential sticking point is the FAA grant used to pay for the walkway assumed the airport would have a usable unit in the terminal for 20 years. "So, we still have to go to the FAA to get approval to be able to remove the walkway," he said.  Parking a premium Northwest Arkansas National Airport officials are looking at expanding outdoor parking at the airport. Design for a plan to add 926 spaces to the lot south of the terminal is about 60% complete, according to staff. The expansion is estimated at $5.6 million. Board members are also studying whether to go ahead with the design of a new rental car facility. Moving rental car companies out of the first floor of the parking garage would make another 340 spaces available for public parking. Airport officials are adding eight more chargers on levels two and three of the parking deck that can be used to recharge up to 16 electric cars. The chargers cost about $132,000. The parking deck has eight chargers.

        A Bentonville man was banned from the Buffalo National River for two years on Tuesday for leading a hike on May 7 in which a Springfield, Mo., man fell to his death. Jeffrey Johnson didn't have a permit to operate a business in the national park and he solicited money for his services, federal Magistrate Judge Mark E. Ford ruled after a bench trial in Harrison in December. During the trial, a park ranger described the hike along Indian Creek Trail as very difficult, with narrow trails along a bluff and a rope climb along the way. He said Brad Lee Thomas, 46, of Springfield, fell about 20 feet from a rock ledge into a pool of water along Indian Creek. On Tuesday, besides banning Johnson from the park, Ford also sentenced him to two years' probation and ordered him to pay $600 in fines, said his attorney, Chris Flanagin of Eureka Springs. "Jeff just wanted to share his love of hiking with others, and it is a tragic case," said Flanagin. "Other hiking and outdoor clubs need to know that a voluntary fee or contribution can be considered a business activity if their activities are conducted in national park or national river boundaries." In the trial, Ford found Johnson guilty of violating two sections of the Code of Federal Regulations: 36 CFR 5.3, engaging in or soliciting business in park areas without a permit; and 36 CFR 2.37, illegally soliciting money, goods or services. Johnson didn't testify during the trial. Based on other testimony, he led a group of 31 hikers along Indian Creek Trail heading to a rock formation known as Eye of the Needle. Indian Creek Trail isn't an official park trail, according to court testimony. In a telephone interview with investigators, the audio of which was played in court, Johnson said he advertised the hike on Facebook and too many people showed up wanting to go. Johnson said he normally limits the number to about 15, but Facebook didn't give him the option to limit the size as a website he previously used allowed him to do. Johnson became emotional and wept during the telephone interview when he spoke of the hiker who died. "I wish he had listened to me about how important it was [to stick together] and how dangerous it was," Johnson could be heard saying on the recording. Thomas and at least one other hiker decided to turn back during the hike, unbeknownst to Johnson, and Thomas fell to his death. During the trial, Daniel Romes, a park ranger who worked at the Buffalo National River in May, said a woman suffered a leg injury on May 1 while hiking with another group led by Johnson in the same area. "I told him to please stop hiking in that area," testified Romes. Romes testified that the park began issuing permits for large group hikes after the May incident. Before that, Johnson's hike wouldn't have been permitted, he said. Flanagin argued that his client took no payment for leading hikes in the national park, so he wasn't operating a business there. But Devon Still, representing the government, produced documents from the internet indicating Johnson sought a $20 annual fee for membership in his hiking group: Arkansas Nature Lovers Group. Some people paid Johnson in the national park, according to court testimony.  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         BENTONVILLE -- Firefighters battled a house fire that caused substantial damage, Battalion Chief Jeremy Metcalf said. Metcalf said firefighters were notified at 7 a.m. Tuesday of a fire at 3404 N.W. Edgewood Ave. He said there was heavy smoke and fire when firefighters arrived. The fire was in the attic and in the back of the house, Metcalf said. It took about 30 minutes to put out the fire, he said. Metcalf said one person was home and no one was injured. "It's still standing but there was a heavy loss to the house," he said. The cause of the fire is still under investigation, he said.

        For the first time, walk-through metal detectors will be used at Bank OZK Arena entrances for the state high school basketball tournament in Hot Springs, officials said. Three entrances will be open for the tournament, which begins Thursday and ends Saturday: Convention Boulevard at Laurel Street; Church Street and Laurel Street; and the Convention Center Concourse. The bridge between the Embassy Suites hotel and the Arena will be closed. Clear bags -- one per person -- will be allowed. The bag must be smaller than 14 x 14 x 6 inches, according to the announcement. Screeners will be looking for prohibited items, which include weapons, knives or firearms; backpacks; bags larger than 14 x 14 x 6 inches; more than one bag; fireworks or pyrotechnics of any kind; outside food or beverages; beach balls; Frisbees; confetti; streamers; laser pointers; balloons; noisemaking devices; audio or video recording devices, except for cell phones and authorized media equipment; signs, flags or banners and "any other items deemed by staff and/or event organizers to be a potential safety or security threat." "We want all fans to have a great time experiencing the competition during this great tournament, and we will be working hard to ensure that fans are safe and secure while rooting for their home teams," said Jennifer Wolcott, director of operations for the Visit Hot Springs tourism agency, in the announcement. "We believe the security measures that will be in effect will make sure that happens." Tickets -- which are electronic-only -- are per session, not per game. One ticket will provide entrance for both the girls and boys games for that classification. After each session, everyone will be required to exit the arena. All tickets are sold through the Arkansas Activities Association website, https://qofan.co/apo/school/AAA. The arena box office will not be open during the tournament.

         ROGERS -- Jose Velazquez said he felt good about his first job interview. "I was nervous, but I wasn't terrified," Velazquez said at the Be Pro Be Proud Draft Day event Tuesday at Rogers High School. "It's my first interview, basically. I just tried to be me, tried to stay calm and be like, 'Yeah, what do you want to know?'" The smiling senior at Springdale's Tyson School of Innovation, who interviewed with Baldwin & Shell Construction Co., said he was tech-savvy, studied industrial maintenance and HVAC and hoped to use those skills in the future. Velazquez, 18, said he's glad the Be Pro Be Proud program helps students find their footing when considering careers. "I like how this draft day event has brought us all together and gives us opportunities, us as students, to grow and find people that will hire us," Velazquez said. "Most people coming out of high school, they're like, 'Oh, what do I do, where do I go, how do I apply?' We're new to this. We don't know what to do, and we feel lost." It was the first of three days of Be Pro Be Proud interviews at Rogers High. As part of the initiative, graduating seniors were paired with businesses that are a good fit based on the students' skills and jobs employers want to fill, said Dawn Stewart, director of career and technical education for the Rogers School District. More than 60 interview tables were in use. Twenty-six Northwest Arkansas companies talked to seniors from the Rogers and Springdale districts, said Alan Turner, Be Pro Be Proud national communications director. As of 2 p.m. Tuesday, around 200 students had participated, Turner said. The 16 jobs featured ranged from automation and robotics, to commercial truck driving and welding. There were mobile workshops and simulators for various occupations, including operating tractor-trailers, diesel trucks, backhoes and trains. There was also an expo for underclassmen. But students are just one part of the equation. Businesses can benefit, too. "The younger generation is the wave of the future for us," Nabholz Construction's Justin Clark said. "The sooner we can bring these students into the workforce, the sooner we can get them trained, and it just moves everything along that much faster." Clark is Nabholz's training coordinator and outreach specialist for excavation. "It gives us an avenue to reach students that we don't normally have," Clark said of the draft day program. "Outside of events like this, we have to schedule classroom times and take time out of schedules of teachers that are teaching to reach out to these kids because that's the only place we can find them." He said he'd already talked to nine students. "The students are very well-educated on what they're looking for," Clark said. "The teachers have done a great job preparing them for events like this so they can come here and find jobs for the future. Some of them are full of questions. Some of them are a little shy." The Be Pro Be Proud program started in eastern Arkansas last year, Stewart said, and the initiative was sparked by the Arkansas State Chamber of Commerce. The Rogers-Lowell and Springdale chambers of commerce are among the sponsors of this week's activities. Tuesday served as the start of Be Pro Be Proud's statewide draft day tour. "Showcasing the benefits of skilled careers to the next generation of professionals is key to helping shape a stronger and more sustainable workforce in Arkansas," Andrew Parker, executive director of Be Pro Be Proud, said in a news release. "Be Pro Be Proud is honored to help close the gap between students and future employers and ensure our state's economic success." Three more draft day stops are planned, according to the release: in Fort Smith, Monday to March 16; Stuttgart, March 28-30; and Jonesboro, April 10-12.

         ROGERS -- The School Board voted unanimously Tuesday to extend the contract of Superintendent Jeff Perry by one year. The 7-0 vote extends Perry's contract through June 2026. The board held off on considering adding compensation until after seeing the effects of pending state legislation. Perry, who started as Rogers' superintendent on July 1, is earning a salary of $250,053 this school year. "Appreciate Dr. Perry with all that's going on down in Little Rock," board President Nathan Gairhan said. "He has stated this for several months now: 'I want to make sure that our staff and our teachers are taken care of. I don't want anybody worrying about my raise right now.' We'll take further consideration after we get more information coming out of Little Rock. It's not a lack of confidence. As [board Vice President] Curtis [Clements] said, we appreciate the job that he's done in the short time that he's been with us, and we look forward to many more years to come." The Arkansas Senate approved Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders' education overhaul by a 26-8 vote Tuesday and sent the bill to the governor's desk for her signature. The legislation, also known as the LEARNS Act, calls for, among other things, school vouchers, a $14,000 raise in the minimum salary for teachers, a dual diploma for high school students learning a trade and a repeal of the Teacher Fair Dismissal Act. Sanders is expected to sign Arkansas LEARNS into law today. Perry was superintendent of schools in Hamblen County, Tenn., before being hired by Rogers. He began his career as a high school teacher and coach in Norton, Va. He later served as an assistant principal at both the high school and middle school level and then as a principal of a large elementary school in Riner, Va. He was superintendent of schools in Byers and Kremmling, Colo.; Wise, Va.; and Wythe County, Va. Perry earned a doctorate in educational administration from Virginia Tech University in 1994. In other business, the board voted 7-0 to approve the guaranteed maximum price range for work on the performing arts centers at both Rogers High School and Heritage High School. The exact figure is $1,585,309. Bids were opened and reviewed Tuesday afternoon. The improvements, including new lighting, sound systems and drapes, are projected to be completed by Aug. 11, before the start of the next school year.

         ROGERS -- Start-up company Loloft is one step closer to bringing its "industrial co-working" concept south of downtown. A rezoning for 600 S. First St. was unanimously approved by the Planning Commission on Tuesday. Pending City Council approval, the rezoning will change the location from the light industrial zoning district to the industrial arts zoning district. The rezoning will bring the property into compliance with the city's comprehensive growth map, which guides development decisions in the city, commissioner Mark Myers said. The company's 28,000-square-foot flagship location will help smaller businesses compete online with facilities and services usually inaccessible to them, though larger companies have also shown interest in leasing its space, according to a Loloft news release from October. Loloft's co-working office space and micro-warehousing units will aim to provide space for companies needing to store or handle products by a model it calls industrial co-working. The facility will also offer shipping receipt and unloading services, loading dock access and amenities like meeting rooms, phone booths and high-speed Wi-Fi at its co-working space, the release states. Northwest Arkansas is generally lacking leasable warehouse space, according to the Skyline Report released in October by the University of Arkansas' Center for Business and Economic Research and sponsored by Arvest Bank. The region's warehouse market has a vacancy rate of less than 1%, down from 6.6% in 2021, according to the report. Ecommerce growth is requiring more warehouse space, Mervin Jebaraj, director of the center and lead researcher for the Skyline Report, said in October. RZC Investments, founded by Steuart and Tom Walton, grandsons of Walmart founder Sam Walton, has backed Loloft's downtown facility, according to the investment firm's website.

        A bill that would strike from state law a defense librarians currently have protecting them from criminal prosecution for distributing obscene material failed to advance from a House panel early Tuesday afternoon. Senate Bill 81 by Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Jonesboro, failed in a tight voice vote in the Judiciary Committee after nearly three hours of discussion and testimony. Rep. Carol Dalby, R-Texarkana, who chairs the committee, moved the panel out of session as at least one committee member requested a roll call vote. After the meeting, Sullivan said he intended to bring the bill back to the committee with an amendment as early as Thursday. He said details were still under consideration and that he wasn't ready to discuss what the amendment might include. While presenting the bill, Sullivan told committee members to beware of misinformation circulating on the measure. Along with addressing criminal liability for librarians, the legislation aims to standardize the process for challenging the "appropriateness of material" available at public and school libraries. He said the measure would not create a list of banned books and would require a librarian to knowingly distribute material deemed obscene by a court before they could be prosecuted. "You can't be held accountable for something you didn't know," Sullivan said. "That's a critical part of the bill." While assembling his bill, Sullivan said he spoke with hundreds of librarians and groups, including the Arkansas Library Association and the Arkansas School Boards Association. Supporters said the measure is needed to protect children from obscene material. Those in favor have said more transparency is needed when it comes to decisions made by libraries on which books they carry. Opponents argued that the bill would invest legislative bodies with judicial power and disproportionally impact books written by and about LGBTQ people. Critics also raised concerns that the bill could lead to libraries and local elected officials being swamped with requests from people outside their communities to remove books. Under current law, libraries must have a "written policy for addressing challenged material." Sullivan's bill would require libraries to form committees to review objections and decide whether to remove a book from shelves. These committees would be subject to open meeting laws, Sullivan said. The bill would allow people to appeal decisions made by these committees to a body of elected officials. In the case of a school library, the superintendent would direct appeals to the school board of directors. For a municipal or public library, the "executive head" of the city or county would present appeals to the "governing body of the county or city." Sullivan noted that local elected officials would not have the authority to determine if the material is obscene. Only a judge could make that determination, he said. Rep. Andrew Collins, D-Little Rock, said that even though the legislative bodies wouldn't be determining if material is obscene, the bill would give them judicial power. "They aren't experts in evaluating individual claims that come up for appeal," he said. "It is a violation of a separation of powers and they're just not prepared for it." John McGraw, director of the Faulkner County Library, voiced concerns that the appeal process could lead to local governments becoming embroiled in expensive legal fights. Parents and community members who favored the bill pointed to examples of books they considered inappropriate for children. Scott Gray, with the Saline County Republican Committee, said that since 2020, children's sections of libraries have "become increasingly full of graphic, sexually explicit material." "It's sad that we need SB81, but the librarians of today are no longer our friends and neighbors," he said. "They're imported from blue states and liberal areas to solid red Arkansas and Saline County. They don't share our conservative values and in many cases, they have an agenda." Several librarians who spoke against the bill noted that they were from Arkansas. Some mentioned in their testimony that they would not loan inappropriate books to children or that their libraries did not carry books some parents deemed obscene. Another section of Sullivan's bill would strike language from the law protecting any employee, director or trustee of a public or school library who is "acting within the scope of his or her regular employment" from prosecution under obscenity laws. Several people noted that the measure would retain protection for museum staff members who distribute obscene material. Sullivan said constituents were not concerned about museum employees releasing material harmful to children. Another provision of the bill would allow libraries to disclose confidential library records to the parent or legal guardian of a minor. The bill also would create a "furnishing harmful item to a minor" offense. Under this provision, a person who knowingly provides a minor with an item that is "harmful to minors" would be guilty of a Class A misdemeanor. A person also could commit this offense by transmitting through direct internet communication an item that is "harmful to minors" to a person they believe to be a minor. The bill points to existing law that provides an extended definition of the term "harmful to minors." Among other characteristics, an item that is "harmful to minors" must be found by an "average" adult "applying contemporary community standards" to have a "predominant tendency to appeal to a prurient interest in sex to minors." An average adult must also find that the item depicts or describes "nudity, sexual conduct, sexual excitement or sadomasochistic abuse in a manner that is patently offensive to prevailing standards in the adult community with respect to what is suitable for minors." The material or performance would have to lack "serious literary, scientific, medical, artistic or political value for minors."  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

            <h2>Bill allowing abortions in the case of lethal fetal abnormalities fails to clear Arkansas House committee</h2>

        An Arkansas House of Representatives committee declined to advance a bill Tuesday that would add an exception to the state's abortion ban for lethal fetal abnormalities. Currently the ban only has an exception for medical emergency to save the life of the mother. House Bill 1301 would add an exception "in the case of a fetal abnormality incompatible with life." The committee on Public Health, Welfare and Labor declined in a voice vote to send the bill to the full House for consideration. The bill's sponsor, Rep. Nicole Clowney, D-Fayetteville, said the additional exception would give pregnant women "a narrow, but critical exception to our state's total abortion ban." She said the bill would permit abortion in cases where "crucial parts of the baby's anatomy -- the brain, the skull, the kidneys -- fail to develop." "This exception is exceedingly narrow," Clowney said. "I want to be clear that it only applies to women whose babies have no chance of surviving outside the womb." Dr. Luann Racher, an obstetrician and gynecologist from Little Rock, explained some of the lethal abnormalities that can develop in unborn children, such as being born without vital organs such as a brain, kidneys or lungs. "For some families, an early delivery may be the only opportunity they have to meet their child," Racher said. "Unfortunately, whenever we have an unborn child with a lethal anomaly they are at increased risk for passing away while they are still in their mother's womb." Rose Mimms, executive director of Arkansas Right to Life, said her group opposes the bill. "Early delivery is abortion," she said. Arkansas' ban on abortion took effect after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the 1973 landmark case of Roe v. Wade, clearing the way for states to ban the procedure. The day after the Supreme Court's decision, then Attorney General Leslie Rutledge signed a certificate implementing a 2019 law that outlaws abortion. Clowney argued that her bill would give mothers the choice to end a pregnancy that will likely end with a birth of a child who is either dead or close to death. "All this bill would do, would be able to allow a mother to grieve her loss in whatever way she chooses," Clowney said. Those who testified against the bill said doctors can get diagnoses wrong. "Even physicians here in our state aren't sensitive to the value of every life," Chantelle Bisbee of Little Rock said. Bisbee said she had a daughter diagnosed with anencephaly, a lethal condition where a child is born without portions of their brain or skull. "I had a physician treat me like I was wasting his time because my child was going to die," Bisbee said. Jon Brown, a father of four, said doctors told him his youngest son would likely not survive due to a genetic abnormality that was "not compatible with life." Brown said doctors misdiagnosed his son, something he and his wife were elated to discover after he was born. "I know that baby now is in first grade, and he's as healthy as a horse," Brown said. Husband and wife Cody and Chelsea Stovall of Fayetteville said because of Arkansas law, she had to seek medical attention out-of-state, when her daughter was "given the diagnosis of not viable" in utero, including a hole in her chest and her intestines "strangling her heart." Chelsea Stovall said she had to travel out-of-state for an early delivery, away from her doctor and the comfort of her family and friends. "Because of the ways that the laws in Arkansas are written, my doctor wasn't able to deliver my baby," Chelsea Stovall said. "I couldn't stay in the state that I love, at the hospital that I trust, with the doctor who flawlessly carried me through two C-section pregnancies."

         A vote of the Little Rock Board of Directors on a resolution that would express the city's opposition to a schedule of water rate hikes was delayed again Tuesday. The measure's sponsor, Ward 5 City Director Lance Hines, asked for the delay during the city board meeting, explaining that he was still in talks with the water utility's chief executive officer. Hines said they had encountered scheduling issues and asked that the resolution be delayed until the first week of April. Consideration of the resolution was previously delayed for two weeks at a Feb. 21 city board meeting at Hines' request. On Jan. 12, Central Arkansas Water's board of commissioners unanimously approved a resolution setting a 10-year schedule of increases. The city councils of Little Rock and North Little Rock would have to vote against the rate increases to block them from taking effect because the two cities formed Central Arkansas Water in 2001. The North Little Rock City Council has yet to take up a measure on the subject. The water utility's board is made up of four Little Rock representatives and three North Little Rock representatives who serve seven-year terms. According to the rate schedule, customers will face higher prices for water every year that are expected to eventually take the cost of water from half a penny per gallon today to one penny per gallon by 2032. The first set of higher rates is scheduled to take effect July 1, and subsequent rate increases will take effect on Jan. 1 of each year. Central Arkansas Water officials believe a doubling of revenue is necessary to pay for hundreds of millions of dollars in capital improvements, plus staff salaries. They arrived at the rate schedule last year with the help of Raftelis, a consulting firm. Among other changes, a new infrastructure fee will support work on three major projects: Improvements to the Jack H. Wilson Water Treatment Plant, work at the source-water reservoir of Lake Maumelle and construction of a 60-inch water pipeline. The water utility's board already has approved a preliminary measure to issue up to $11 million in revenue bonds in the near future to fund upgrades at the Wilson treatment plant.

        Attorneys for The Satanic Temple, the Freedom From Religion Foundation and the Arkansas attorney general's office filed motions in federal court this week asking for summary judgment in a lawsuit over a Ten Commandments monument that was erected on the grounds of the state Capitol nearly five years ago. Act 1231 of 2015, sponsored by then-Sen. Jason Rapert, R-Conway and co-sponsored by then-Rep. Kim Hammer, R-Benton, says the General Assembly found that the Ten Commandments "are an important component of the moral foundation of the laws and legal system of the United States of America and of the state of Arkansas," and they "represent a philosophy of government held by many of the founders of this nation." The Satanic Temple motion, filed along with a 35-page brief, maintains it was illegally denied placement of its own monument when the Legislature changed the rules after it appeared the temple's request for one was on the verge of authorization. The lawsuit, Cave et al. v. John Thurston, was originally filed against then-Secretary of State Mark Martin on May 23, 2018. On June 25, 2018, it was merged with a similar lawsuit, Orsi et al. v. Martin, which was filed the same day. Both lawsuits contend that the monument violates the First Amendment by establishing governmental preference of one religion above all others. The first Ten Commandments monument was installed at the Capitol on June 27, 2017, but was toppled within 24 hours by a man who rammed it with his vehicle and was later found mentally unfit to proceed to trial. A replacement monument, surrounded by 3-foot-tall concrete posts, was installed April 26, 2018. The monument has been a lightning rod for controversy since passage of the state's Ten Commandments Monument Display Act in 2015. It became even more of a lightning rod in 2017 with passage of Act 274, sponsored by Hammer and co-sponsored by Rapert, which changed the rules to require legislative approval for any monument before the proposal could be presented to the Capitol Arts and Grounds Committee. That legislation was introduced about a month after the committee's approval of The Satanic Temple's proposal to erect a statue of Baphomet -- a part-man, part-goat deity who is seated and accompanied by two smiling children -- alongside the Ten Commandments monument. Hammer served in the House for eight years before being elected to the Senate in 2018. Rapert, who served as a senator from 2011 until 2023, was defeated by former Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge in 2022 in his bid for the state lieutenant governor's office. She replaced former Lt. Gov. Tim Griffin, who was elected attorney general in 2022. Griffin said Tuesday that he stood behind his office's motion for summary judgment in favor of Thurston that said the change in the law streamlined the process by which organizations can have a monument erected. That filing said that the "Vetting Efficiency Act," as the law is referred to, was passed in order that private sponsors could cross the most challenging hurdle -- legislative approval -- first, so that those sponsors and the Capitol Arts and Grounds Committee would not "waste resources on vetting potential monuments that lack support of the General Assembly." However, the Satanic Temple, arguing that it is a minority religion recognized by the Internal Revenue Service through its designation as a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) public charity, said in its filing that two days after the Jan. 24, 2017 introduction of the bill that became Act 274, Rapert posted a video to his Facebook page calling the organizational belief structure of The Satanic Temple, "vile," "unnecessary" and "an affront to every American citizen." "It will be a very cold, cold day in Hell," The Satanic Temple's filing quoted Rapert as saying, "before you'll ever see a statue from The Satanic Temple or some other group like that at the Arkansas Capitol. It is not going to happen. So, rest easy." On Tuesday, Sam Grover, associate counsel for the Freedom From Religion Foundation, which represents the Orsi plaintiffs, said while the goal of The Satanic Temple is to have all religions represented on the Capitol grounds, his organization's aim is to have no religion represented, because such representation gives state approval to religion in defiance of the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution. "In this case, the establishment clause was designed to prohibit governmental preferences for any faith or religion," Grover said. "That's exactly what the Arkansas General Assembly did in this case. It created a monument that, by its own admission, is meant to commemorate the Ten Commandments, a quintessentially religious idol." According to the Freedom From Religion Foundation's filing, the framers of the U.S. Constitution relied upon a number of sources "from which they drew inspiration while forming our Republic," including Roman law, European Continental law, British law and other legal systems but that the "Ten Commandments did not garner a mention." That filing also says there is no mention of the Ten Commandments or the Bible in the index of the Federalist Papers, authored by Alexander Hamilton, John Jay and James Madison, and that case law early in the country's history had "no significant reliance on the Ten Commandments." "There's no case law in the 19th Century to indicate that judges or lawyers believed the Ten Commandments served as the basis for American law," Grover said. "In all of the Federalist Papers where they're discussing the meaning of the Constitution, they never bring it up. There's no reason to believe the Ten Commandments served as a basis for modern American law." The lawsuit is being heard by U.S. District Judge Kristine G. Baker. As of Tuesday night, no hearings on the summary judgment motions had been scheduled.  Print Headline: Parties seek judgment in monument lawsuit Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         An Altheimer man was found guilty of killing two men during a confrontation near Tucker in 2018 and will serve the rest of his life in prison. During a two-day trial before Judge Jodi Raines Dennis in Jefferson County Circuit Court last week, Joshua Lasley, now 32, was convicted on two counts of first-degree murder, one for the death of Trevarland Smith and the other for Rodney Henry Scaife. Lasley received two life sentences plus 10 years for a firearm enhancement, all to run consecutively. Lasley was on parole for felony convictions when he was arrested, according to court documents. According to an affidavit, Smith was found lying unresponsive on the west side of Arkansas 15 North near Tucker on the evening of June 22, 2018, and transported to Jefferson Regional Medical Center, where he died. Scaife was found in a black Dodge pickup truck on the east side of the highway unresponsive. According to an affidavit, witnesses stated four people, including Kevin Kimble and Lasley, were leaving Kimble's father's house in another truck, a Chevrolet driven by Montel Vanderbilt, headed to Tucker for a haircut. Smith reportedly did a U-turn and ended up behind the truck, got out of his vehicle and was talking to Lasley, who then got out of the Chevy. Scaife got into the driver's seat of Smith's truck and pulled it in front of the other truck, as Kimble heard a gunshot, according to the affidavit. "Rodney drove off in Trevarland's truck and hit what Kevin believed to be a water tank," the affidavit reads. "Joshua pointed a gun at Kevin and told Kevin 'don't f***ing move.' Kevin heard [another witness] yelling 'don't shoot my cousin.' Kimble moved Trevarland across the road and tried to assist him." Vanderbilt said Lasley got into his truck and told him to drive. An arrest warrant for Lasley was served June 26, 2018. Prosecuting Attorney Kyle Hunter and Shana Alexander represented the state in the trial. "This definitely needed to be resolved," Hunter said. "We are happy for the families of the victims that they can proceed to finally heal from the loss of their loved ones. This was so important to get part of the process done for the families to continue healing." Pine Bluff attorney William Howard represented Lasley. A call to Howard's office was not answered. Hunter also said Tuesday the capital murder trial of Keshone Smith, who is accused of killing Pine Bluff Police Det. Kevin Collins in an October 2020 shootout at a motel, will be rescheduled from late April after Keshone Smith's attorney filed a motion to move the trial, citing a conflict in dates with another trial involving Smith's mitigation specialist and that the mitigation and fact investigations in Keshone Smith's case are not complete.

         The Little Rock Police Department has identified a man who was found dead in the front seat of his truck last week, the department said in a news release. Alvin Terry, 49, of Little Rock was found just before 3 p.m. on Feb. 26 in a Chevrolet Tahoe at 11700 Interstate 30 by officers responding to a report of a subject down, the release says. A Love's Travel Stop and a Hardee's restaurant are listed as being at that address. The release says the state medical examiner found that Terry's death was from natural causes. Terry's employer told police he'd been looking for Terry since November 2022 and that Terry was "not in the best health," the release says.

         WASHINGTON -- U.S. Rep. French Hill, R-Ark., emphasized on Tuesday the importance of supporting the Syrian people as he and others spoke about the war that has killed thousands and displaced millions. Hill, a Little Rock Republican, spoke at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum during an event regarding the conflict. Hill has been vocal in opposing Syrian President Bashar Assad and military actions that transformed civilian protests into a bloody war. More than 300,000 people have died in the conflict, with 13 million Syrians displaced or living as refugees. "We've got to push back consistently against the Assad regime," Hill said Tuesday. "I want you to know that the House of Representatives, on a bipartisan basis, stands with the people of Syria who want their country back. They want to go home, and to the beauty that once was Syria and not the mayhem it has become over the past decade." The event came weeks after a massive earthquake in southeast Turkey and northern Syria. At least 50,000 people, including 6,000 people in Syria, died, with thousands of others left homeless. "People are just exhausted," said Celine Kassem, media coordinator with the American-based nonprofit Syrian Emergency Task Force. "They have reached a point of so much mental and physical trauma that this one earthquake was the last thing they had not experienced until today." Kassem, who was a 10-year-old living in Syria when the conflict began, said the war has evolved into multiple crises with Assad "starving" the Syrian people. She recalled traveling to Turkey and northwest Syria shortly after last month's earthquake and the despondence and betrayal present throughout communities. "They just kept asking, why has the world, once again, after this natural disaster, forgotten about us?" she said. "After an earthquake, there's a time frame for people to come in and help, and we needed those resources to save these lives." Northwest Syria, according to Kassem, is an area whose population has increased because of displacement tied to the conflict. Journalists joined Kassem on her trip, in which she served as an interpreter for reporters. "I was translating for the journalists and, to some degree, [the earthquake victims] just kept talking and talking," she said. "They genuinely just wanted someone to listen and recognize their pain after all of these years." Mayson Almisri, the advocacy and media officer with the Syria Civil Defence, a humanitarian group of volunteers also known as the White Helmets, compared northwest Syria to a "punishment region." She said organizations faced challenges in aiding people living in the area even before the earthquake. "What's happening in Syria is not a civil war. It's not a war between different proxies or anything else," she said through an interpreter. "It's a revolution of people that demanded their dignity and freedom. It is the Syrian people versus a horrific dictator and his regime. It's a fight between evil and goodness, between justice and injustice." A reoccurring topic from the speakers was the fear of governments tolerating Assad's regime as the military conflict continues. Officials with Arab nations met with Assad late last month with some consideration of welcoming Syria back into the regional Arab League association; Syria's association was suspended in November 2011 because of the war. Iran and Russia have backed Assad and his government during the war, with both countries providing Syria with military support. "Under no circumstances -- under no circumstances -- should the United States wink or nod or even remotely entertain a meeting with another government that seeks to normalize diplomatic relations with Syria," Hill said. "That's a catastrophic mistake, and not one that will have any support on Capitol Hill." Hill has led legislative efforts targeting the Assad regime during his tenure in Congress. The congressman helped introduce legislation last Congress requiring the federal government to develop a plan to stop narcotics production linked to Assad. The bill passed last December as part of the National Defense Authorization Act.  Print Headline: Hill urges pushing back on Assad Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         Man arrested in two carjackings Little Rock police on Monday morning arrested a man who they say carjacked two people and crashed their vehicles before officers could capture him, according to an arrest report. Authorities say that Jequinte Gardner, 18, of Little Rock stole a vehicle from a person near 10434 W. 36th St. and fled in it before crashing near Shackleford West Boulevard and Centerview Drive, about 2 miles away. Gardner then carjacked a second vehicle with a woman inside and fled before crashing once more on nearby South Bowman Road, the report says. He then fled on foot and made it to Lisa Academy West Middle School at 23 Corporate Hill Road, roughly two miles away, before officers arrested him around 11:44 a.m, the report says. Gardner faces multiple felony charges -- two counts of theft of property and one each of kidnapping, robbery and leaving the scene of an accident -- as well as a misdemeanor fleeing count. He was being held Tuesday night in the Pulaski County jail with no bond amount listed, an online inmate roster showed. Police find pistol during traffic stop The Arkansas State Police early Tuesday afternoon arrested a Searcy man who illegally had a pistol during a traffic stop, according to an arrest report. A trooper pulled over Cameron Kingsby, 22, around 12:57 p.m. on U.S. 67 near mile marker 6 because he was speeding, the report says. Kingsby is a convicted felon and cannot legally own a gun. He was on supervision and had a search waiver on file, the report says. A search of the vehicle located a Taurus G3 9mm pistol in the glove box, the report says. Kingsby faces charges of felony possession of a firearm by certain persons and misdemeanor counts of speeding and not having liability insurance. He was being held Tuesday night in the Pulaski County jail, with no bond amount listed, according to the jail's online inmate roster.

         Two men were killed in separate crashes on state roads Saturday and Monday, according to preliminary crash reports from authorities. A 56-year-old motorcyclist was killed in a wreck in Sevier County on Monday afternoon, according to a report from the Arkansas State Police. Troopers said Kelly Purtell of Lockesburg died after the 2009 Yamaha motorcycle he was riding west on Melrose Road in Lockesburg hit a ditch on the side of the road, causing him to be separated from the motorcycle just before 1:30 p.m., the report says. Another crash on Saturday afternoon killed a Harrison man, a preliminary report from the Boone County sheriff's office says. Derrick Alsobrook, 29, died after the 2005 Honda he was driving east on Hopewell Road in Harrison overturned near Woodland Lane at 1:05 p.m., the report says.

         CONWAY -- Candidates hoping to unseat incumbents on the Conway School Board on Monday vowed to focus on education and not issues that have divided the community in recent months. Trey Geier, Sheila Franklin and Jess Disney spoke Monday at a forum hosted by the Faulkner County Democratic Party and the Faulkner County Democratic Women. Geier will face Bill Milburn for a seat representing the school board's Zone 5 in the May 9 election, while Franklin and Disney are vying to oust board Vice President Jessica Cunningham for an at-large position. Conway residents were encouraged to attend the event at the McGee Center in Conway to talk with the candidates about the future of the board after months of contention over its actions. Franklin, who was born and raised in Conway, highlighted her experience working with young people from "every walk of life" as a Head Start teacher and later as a juvenile probation and intake officer. Just weeks ago, a directive from the board prohibited her daughter, LaShanta Johnson, and other coaches in the district from wearing "Celebrate Black History" shirts. At a February meeting, board members apologized to the coaches, calling it a misunderstanding and mistake. The episode followed months of debate related to transgender bathroom policies, books banned from district libraries, a drafted curriculum policy prohibiting teachers from using more than 80 terms and phrases, a policy that requires staff to automatically delete emails after three days and frustrations with the board's refusal to host monthly meetings in a bigger space. "I am not OK with board members and school leaders changing the narrative to focus on their declaration saying 'I am not a racist.' I have not called any of these leaders racist, though it is clear that they have felt the need to defend themselves against that hateful word," Johnson said in a video uploaded to Facebook after the T-shirt incident. "As a mother of two Black children, I have to show them that we have the right to speak up for ourselves and for our basic human rights -- even if it means standing up to your bosses when they are wrong." Franklin said the hurt she saw in her daughter and in the community after the episode only fueled her desire to make a difference on the board. "My heart is here in Conway and in the Conway public schools. I know that we are a long way from where we need to be and where we have been, but I know that we can get back there," Franklin said Monday. "I'll only be one voice, but I can promise I'll be a loud voice. I will support and represent this city well. I believe that the school board should focus mainly on educating our kids, all of our kids." Disney, a 2010 graduate of Conway High School, also shared her visions and goals if elected to the at-large position. "I really believe we are at a new chapter for Conway schools," Disney said. "My campaign is built around education, being your voice on the board and teachers mattering. I believe we need to ensure equitable and quality education for all of our students by creating an inclusive learning environment through policies that support and nurture every child in our school district regardless of their background, identity or ability." Her campaign announcement page reads, "I have a strong belief that it is critical we listen to the voice of members within our community and the students themselves if we are going to continue to increase student achievement and build the foundations necessary for us to remain as one of the best school districts in Arkansas." Geier was last to introduce himself to the crowd. He said he has three children in Conway schools. "I've had experience with special education, gifted education, orchestra, athletics and more. All of our teachers are important to us and we're seeing administrators, teachers, staff and all of our intellectual knowledge go to other school districts because of our current district," he said. Geier said his goal on the board would be to stop pushing policies and decisions on teachers and students and to encourage the board to do more listening. Each candidate also responded to complaints about a lack of transparency from the district and the size of the board's meeting space. "I would hope that when I become a board member that we will work as one team," Franklin said. "We are a public school and I think the public should be able to attend whatever meeting the public wants to be at. I would like for us to get to a point where transparency becomes very easy and there is nothing to hide. "I would really like to get to a point where we're focused so much on the business that we should be focused on that you all won't even want to be there." Disney said, "We have plenty of rooms and space available, especially near the administration, that would be more than capable of hosting everybody that's been wanting to attend." Geier also responded to frustrations on the lack of space during the monthly meetings. "There are more people in the overflow space than there are actually in the meeting space," Geier said. "We can have the school board meetings in the overflow and see everyone that wants to be there. It's a really easy thing to do and it's something we have to address." Milburn and Cunningham were also invited to speak at the event but did not attend. "There was a meeting hosted by the Democrats of Faulkner County. Since I am a strong conservative, there was zero chance of either gaining or losing support from the Democrats," Milburn said in an interview Tuesday. "Personal, one-on-one contact is the most effective way to share my thoughts, as well as receive open and honest input from the community. I also plan to speak with any civic groups that will invite me. I already represent all the kids." Milburn was appointed to the Zone 5 seat after Scott Champlin resigned from the post in September. Cunningham, who was first elected in 2018, did not respond to emailed questions Tuesday.  Print Headline: School board hopefuls speak at forum Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         Seventh and eighth grade students at North Little Rock Middle School will pivot to remote instruction today after officials on Tuesday detected "a strong odor" in one of the classrooms, Superintendent Gregory J. Pilewski said. "We have not been able to establish the cause of the odor," he said in an announcement on the district's webpage Tuesday evening, adding that remote learning is being done "out of precaution" until the problem can be cleared. On Tuesday morning, the North Little Rock Fire Department responded to a call from the school, where some students and teachers reported feeling nauseated and dizzy, according to Dustin Barnes, the North Little Rock School District's communications coordinator. The fire department's hazmat crews tested the air quality and detected low-oxygen levels. Officials relocated the students to the Charging Wildcat Arena at the North Little Rock High School campus. Pilewski said the situation does not affect the Sixth Grade Campus at the middle school. That campus, he said, will operate as normal today. He thanked the school community "for your patience, understanding, and flexibility regarding the evacuation of the campus [Tuesday]," he said. The situation at the middle school was the second time that the district has had a problem at one of its buildings recently. On Feb. 22, district officials shifted ninth through twelfth grade students to remote learning for three consecutive days after a discovery of bats at the high school. The middle school and high school building issues are unrelated.  Print Headline: School goes remote after low oxygen Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         A man was found dead Sunday on the railroad tracks behind the Saline County sheriff's office in Benton, police said. The man, later identified as Anthony Page, 36, was found near 735 S. Neely St. just before 9:15 a.m., Benton police said in a news release. Police said the death is under investigation. "Page's injuries are consistent with being struck by a train, but the investigation remains ongoing," the release said. Benton police spokesperson Krista Petty said Tuesday that it appeared Page had previously lived in several locations, including Hot Springs, but he was most recently living in Benton.

         Arkansas Tech University's president has been named 2023 ACUI president of the year. Robin E. Bowen received the award during the ACUI annual conference earlier this month in Boston. "It is my honor to represent ACUI as its president of the year for 2023," Bowen said. "We've all been tested by fire -- it is part of leadership -- [and] I commend higher education leaders in ACUI and elsewhere for their resiliency, passion, determination, and caring. It is through the application of these characteristics that we rise each day to meet new challenges in service to our students." Formerly known as the Association of College Unions International, ACUI is the professional home to thousands of campus community builders around the world, according to the organization. "In preparation for building a new student union and recreation center, Dr. Robin Bowen intentionally provided many student groups the platform to voice their needs," according to ACUI. "She is a tireless advocate for resources and tools that will help students succeed and provides support for opportunities such as OnTrack, a program that inspires students to reach their full potential through participation in various co-curricular experiences. Her emphasis on grit, integrity and success is instilled in students through (her) leadership and connection with the campus community." The words ACUI uses to describe the members of its organization resonate with Bowen, she said. "Resilient. Passionate. Determined. Caring. These same words are often attributed to our institution, Arkansas Tech University, as well as the people who study, teach, and work there. I believe there is no greater quality a person can possess than grit." Site work on the new student union and recreation center is projected to begin in June, with construction scheduled to begin later this year with a scheduled grand opening in the summer of 2025, said Sam Strasner, director of university relations. It will "provide space for a campus living room/lounge, outdoor recreation, individual and group fitness activities, student organizations, food service, a convenience store/spirit shop, multi-purpose meeting rooms, two basketball courts, a multi-activity court, a cafe, and events at multiple scales." On Track, introduced campus-wide in 2013, "is a co-curricular experience designed to enhance student development beyond the classroom setting, encourage students to network socially among peers, and to include students in traditional and signature university events," added Strasner. Bowen, the first female president of Arkansas Tech, was unanimously elected by ATU's Board of Trustees in 2014, and private support for the university has steadily increased during her tenure, according to Strasner. Donors provided more than $12.5 million in new gifts and pledges to the ATU Foundation during the 2021-22 fiscal year, and the university is engaged in its first comprehensive capital campaign. ATU has developed and enacted a pair of strategic plans under her leadership, as well as a new campus master plan and new mission and vision statements, according to Strasner. The four-year graduation rate for first-time freshmen on the campus in Russellville, and the three-year graduation rate at ATU-Ozark campus, have both improved during her tenure. Arkansas Tech is tops in the state on the 2022 Social Mobility Index, a position it has held eight of the last nine years, and ATU is among the top 5% of all U.S. institutions of higher education on the Social Mobility Index, according to Strasner. In addition, U.S. News and World Report selected ATU as the No. 1 public, regional university in Arkansas as part of its 2022 and 2023 college rankings for overall quality, and ATU is listed among U.S. News and World Report's top 32 public universities in the South.

         Bill requires sign to protect health staff The Arkansas Senate on Tuesday approved a bill that would require medical facilities to post a written notice about the potential of being charged with a felony crime for attacking a health care professional, including a nurse. The Senate voted 32-0 to send Senate bill 344 by Sen. Kim Hammer, R-Benton, to the House for further consideration. Under the bill, the written notice would be required to be posted at entrances to a health care facility, emergency department, clinic or long-term care facilities that are used by patients and visitors and in a patient waiting area of a health care facility, emergency department, clinic or long-term care facility. The Arkansas Nurses Association would be required to provide the Department of Health a digital poster design that shall be used by a health care facility under the bill. The bill would require a law enforcement agency to allow a health care professional listed under Arkansas Code Annotated 5-13-202 (a) (4) (E) to list a work address in lieu of his or her home address when filing a police report or complaint related to an incident that meets the requirements of battery in the second degree under that part of state law. -- Michael R. Wickline House amends bill on porn site liability The Arkansas House on Tuesday approved an amendment to a bill that aims to hold pornography websites liable for displaying content to minors. The voice vote in the House sends Senate Bill 66 by Sen. Tyler Dees, R-Siloam Springs, back to the Committee on House Rules for further consideration. Senate Bill 66 would require commercial entities displaying pornography to use a "reasonable age verification method," which includes providing a digital ID, a government-issued ID or any "commercially reasonable age verification method." Rep. Mindy McAlindon, R-Centerton, said the amendment was needed to clarify distinctions between "corporate entities" and "third party vendors" in the bill. -- Will Langhorne  Print Headline: State Capitol news in brief Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         Members of the Little Rock Board of Directors in unanimous voice votes on Tuesday rejected two ordinances intended to protect the historic fabric of the Little Rock Central High School neighborhood through the creation of a local-ordinance district. Board meeting materials said city staff had recommended the measures be denied and referred back to the city's Historic District Commission, but Little Rock Mayor Frank Scott Jr. threw cold water on the idea that the proposal would go before the city board again in the future. One of the two ordinances defeated Tuesday would have established what is known as a local-ordinance district to give the Historic District Commission oversight regarding certain changes to properties or new construction near Central High School. The local-ordinance district's boundaries would have matched those of the Central High School Neighborhood Historic District, as listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Sheila Miles, president of the Wright Avenue Neighborhood Association, told city board members that her group had submitted a four-page letter expressing opposition to the proposed local-ordinance district. In the letter, residents "expressed concerns about displacement of residents and economic burdens imposed upon low- and fixed-income residents," she said. Miles said she did not understand what a referral back to the Historic District Commission meant. Scott later said the proposal had to go back, but suggested that commission members "will get the drift when they see a no from the city board, and you won't see it come back before the city board." City Director Virgil Miller Jr., the Ward 1 representative, at one point noted the two neighborhoods that would be most affected by the proposal, the Central High Neighborhood Association and the Wright Avenue Neighborhood Association, had both registered their opposition. The boundaries of the Central High School Neighborhood Historic District encompass an area just north of Central High School, from West 12th Street and Thayer Street, southeast to West Roosevelt Road and Martin Luther King Jr. Drive. The neighborhood was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. Its boundaries were expanded in 2012. According to a city report that endorsed the creation of a local-ordinance district near Central High School, the 2012 expansion was meant "to increase the number of historically significant resources and fill the deficit of lost structures." "Today, the Central High School Neighborhood Historic District is identified as an endangered historical resource," the report said. "The district suffers extensively from demolitions, property neglect, and incompatible alterations. The City of Little Rock has enacted multiple indirect tools to address this endangerment over the years, but these have fallen short of impacting the issue in a meaningful way." At least 51% of properties must be designated as "contributing" to a district's historic status in order for such a district to retain its status on the National Register of Historic Places, the report said. City board members in January approved an extension until April 19 of a temporary moratorium halting the issuance of certain demolition and exterior building permits in the neighborhood. The city board originally approved the moratorium last summer. The only existing local-ordinance district in the city surrounds MacArthur Park. At the moment, the Historic District Commission "reviews requests to be allowed to make changes, additions, or alterations to the exterior of structures within the [MacArthur Park Historic] District via a Certificate of Appropriateness," according to the city's website. Besides the ordinance that would have established the new local-ordinance district, the city board on Tuesday denied an ordinance to expand the commission from seven to nine members. Members serve three-year terms. According to the proposed ordinance, one of the new positions would have been held by an owner/occupant of property north of Wright Avenue within the Central High School local-ordinance district; the other new position would have been held by an owner/occupant south of Wright Avenue within the district.

         An Arkansas Senate committee on Tuesday endorsed a bill that would require the state treasurer and public entities to divest certain investments with financial services providers on a list maintained by the state treasurer due to the use of environmental, social justice or governance-related metrics. In a voice vote with Sen. Clarke Tucker, D-Little Rock, dissenting, the Senate State Agencies and Governmental Affairs Committee sent an amended version of House Bill 1307 by Rep. Jeff Wardlaw, R-Hermitage, to the full Senate. Wardlaw told the Senate committee the bill includes a provision that states that "discriminating against energy companies" does not include actions by the investment adviser in accordance with the investment-related guidelines, policies or preference of its clients, so that's why he believes the impact of the bill will be minimal on state government's retirement systems. The bill also exempts "indirect holdings." State government's retirement systems have estimated HB1307 could potentially cost them millions of dollars. Clint Rhoden, executive director of the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System, asked the Senate committee to amend the bill to completely exempt state government retirement systems to mirror West Virginia's bill and deal with ESG investing issues in a separate bill. But Wardlaw said he already has amended the bill in good faith to minimize the impact of the bill on state government retirement systems. Tucker said that "right now we say that we are for limited government, and with this bill we are saying we are regulating the conduct of private business. "I can't understand how that's limited government," he said. "We also claim to be fiscal conservatives and we know this bill is going to have a fiscal impact," Tucker said. "It's going to be hard to know what it is." He said "for this committee to pass this bill right after we just passed [Senate Bill 71 by Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Jonesboro] the irony is rich beyond measure, because we are saying we are ending discrimination based on race or gender, and with our very next item of business we are going to pass a preference of discrimination" under HB1307. "This is the most explicitly hypocritical action I think that I have ever seen in this legislative body for the entire time I have been a member, these two bills right next to each other," Tucker said. But Sen. Jim Dotson, R-Bentonville, said "we are talking about public entities. "We are not talking about private businesses," he said. "We are talking about public taxpayer dollars that are being invested in entities." Tucker countered "so we are using the public funds to regulate the conduct of private banks. "That's what this bill does," he said. Sen. John Payton, R-Wilburn, said "it concerns me that this bill is kind of like an affirmative action reverse discrimination thing. "But I do see it as extremely temporary when I read those couple of paragraphs where the [ESG] committee will create the list as it exists today," he said. "If the actions change, then the list changes and there is no need to reform the committee if things get better." Sen. Steve Crowell, R-Magnolia, said, "My biggest concern has been being good stewards of the people's retirement funds. "I am not 100% happy, but I am a lot happier," with the amendments to the bill, he said. Under HB1307, an ESG oversight committee would be created to determine a list of financial service providers that discriminate against energy, fossil fuel, firearms or ammunition companies or otherwise refuse to deal based on environmental, social justice and other governance-related factors. The committee would comprise four citizens of the state with the governor, attorney general, House speaker and Senate president pro tempore each appointing one citizen, and the state treasurer or his designee under the bill. The state treasurer would be required to maintain a list of financial service providers as determined by the ESG oversight committee on the state treasurer's website under the bill. In determining whether to list a financial services provider on the list, the state treasurer, under the direction of the attorney general, would be required to consider and may rely upon specified information under the bill. The state treasurer would be required under the bill to divest the state of all direct or indirect holdings with a financial services provider included on the list published on the state treasurer's website, and a public entity would be required to divest itself of all direct or indirect holdings with a financial services provider included on the list published on the state treasurer's website. If an investment is subject to divestment under the bill, but is locked into a maturity date and an early divestment would result in a financial penalty to the state and cause a negative financial impact to the state, then the investment is exempt from divestiture under the bill in order to prevent financial harm to the state and ensure that the fiduciary duty for the state treasurer is met. Clint Rhoden, executive director of the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System, told the Senate committee on Tuesday that exemption seems to be narrowly tailored to the state treasurer. He said the system's investment consultant, Aon Hewitt Investment Consulting, estimated two weeks ago that the system could lose $7 million a year as a result of the bill requiring the state treasurer and public entities to divest certain investments with financial services providers on a list maintained by the state treasurer due to use of environmental, social justice or governance-related metrics. The system has $7 billion in direct investments in a total investment portfolio totaling about $20.3 billion, Rhoden said. If financial service providers are placed on the state treasurer's list under the bill, Rhoden said that would reduce competition among financial service providers and raise the system's costs. Officials at the Arkansas Public Employees Retirement System have estimated the system could have a potential loss of $30 million to $40 million per year under the bill. The system's investments are valued at about $10.5 billion. "At present, we have no exact determination of what entities will be excluded from investments, so it is a very difficult calculation, " system Executive Director Amy Fecher said Monday in a written statement.

        No candidate qualified by a March 1 filing deadline to be placed on the ballot for election May 9 to the Jacksonville/North Pulaski School Boards at-large no. 2 seat. As a result, Ron McDaniel — the current board member in the position who attempted unsuccessfully to file for re-election — can continue to hold the seat for another full term, which is four years. Because there will be no candidates running for election in the district this year and no proposed change in the districts school tax rate, the School Board agreed Monday night to conduct a legally required annual vote on the school tax rate via early and absentee voting. No polling places will be open on election day in the district. McDaniel took steps to file as a candidate for re-election by last weeks filing deadline, but some signatures on his petition for candidacy were disqualified by the Pulaski County Clerks office. That left McDaniel without enough petition signatures and not enough time to collect more to be eligible to be put on the ballot. However, no one else filed as a candidate for the board seat in the 4,000-student district. As a result, McDaniel has become a “holdover” board member. Scott Richardson, an attorney for the School District, told the School Board at its monthly business meeting Monday that Arkansas Code Annotated 6-13-608 allows a “holdover” candidate to serve one full term. If at the expiration of the holdover term — which in McDaniels case would be in 2027 — the board member must either seek election and win the election, or the remaining board members must declare the seat vacant and appoint someone to hold the seat. Only one “holdover” term is permitted by the law. “You get one mulligan,” Richardson told board members about hold-over terms. McDaniel retired in 2012 as a colonel and commander of the 189th Maintenance Group, Arkansas Air National Guard at Little Rock Air Force Base. His leadership with the district dates back to the 2014 establishment of the district. The Jacksonville district was formed that year after voters in the region opted to detach from the Pulaski County Special School District. Based on that vote, the Arkansas Board of Education ordered the creation of the district and appointed an interim School Board — including McDaniel — to begin the work of dividing assets and liabilities between the new district and the Pulaski County Special district, and otherwise prepare the Jacksonville/North Pulaski district for operating on its own. McDaniel later ran for and won election to the board that replaced the state-appointed board.. The at-large seat held by McDaniel is one of two on the seven-member board. Candidates for at-large seats are chosen by districtwide voters. Five members of the Jacksonville board are elected from zones in the district. Board member terms are unpaid. People seeking to be candidates for school board seats in Arkansas have to qualify by submitting a political practices pledge, an affidavit of eligibility and a petition signed by at least 20 registered voters who are residents of the school district and, if applicable, the election zone for the position. Those documents go to the county clerk. Jacksonville/North Pulaski is the only school district in Pulaski County to schedule annual school elections for the spring. The Little Rock, North Little Rock and Pulaski County Special districts hold their elections in November.   Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        Officials at the Arkansas Public Employees Retirement System estimate the system could lose about $30 million to $40 million a year as a result of a bill that would require the state treasurer and public entities to divest certain investments with financial services providers on a list maintained by the state treasurer due to use of environmental, social justice or governance-related metrics. Officials at the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System estimate the system could lose $7 million a year in what they describe as a conservative estimate as a result of the legislation. The bill is House Bill 1307 by Rep. Jeff Wardlaw, R-Hermitage, which cleared the House in a 79-12 vote Feb. 16. Wardlaw told a House committee last month the bill is aimed at making sure the state doesn't put its funds into companies that discriminate against the firearms, ammunition and fossil fuel industries, and the bill would exempt "indirect holdings" to minimize the financial impact on the state government's retirement systems. The bill has been amended once in the Senate and is in the Senate State Agencies and Governmental Affairs Committee. Wardlaw said Monday he doesn't buy the state retirement systems' estimates of his bill's potential losses to state government's retirement systems. He maintained the retirement systems indicated the impact of the bill would be minimal before the bill cleared the House. "It is kind of crazy that they came up with these estimates," he said in an interview. "I can't wait to call them out on it." But Amy Fecher, executive director of the Arkansas Public Employees Retirement System, said Monday "These are the first numbers we have provided. "At present, we have no exact determination of what entities will be excluded from investments, so it is a very difficult calculation, " she said in a written statement. "We have been working with our consultants comparing what other states have excluded, to get our estimates of the impact to the system's trust fund and our members." Clint Rhoden, executive director of the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System, said Monday the teacher retirement system's investment consultant Aon Hewitt Investment Consulting developed the estimated loss of $7 million a year to the system from the bill after Sen. Jimmy Hickey, R-Texarkana, requested estimates from the state government's retirement systems. He said it's his duty to inform senators about the potential impact of the bill to the system, which has total investments valued at $20.3 billion. Fecher said in an email dated Feb. 22 to Hickey that "[i]n response to your request for state retirement systems to provide an estimated loss with the current version of HB1307, we estimate approximately $30-$40 million per year." "In round numbers, APERS is 85% direct investments and 15% indirect investments," she said in the email obtained by the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette through a public records request under the Arkansas Freedom of Information Act. "Our Chief Investment Officer put together the attached table [that] shows a range of 10-70 basis points in losses. Our best estimate is that it will be somewhere in the 30-40 basis points," Fecher said of the public employees retirement system with investments of about $10.5 billion. Thirty to 40 basis points is equal to 0.3% to 0.4%. Rhoden said in an email dated Feb. 22 to Hickey that on "a conservative basis, it is estimated that ATRS could experience a cost of 10 basis points to the annual return of investments if HB1307 is enacted." Ten basis points is equal to 0.1%. "This would be due to divestment mandates and lack of access to competitive financial services placed on direct investments made by the system," Rhoden wrote in the email obtained by the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette under the Arkansas Freedom of Information Act. "Currently, ATRS has about $7 billion in direct investments. Therefore, the potential cost could be about $7 million per year," Rhoden said. "If this starts us down a slippery slope to also include indirect investments, this estimate would be substantially higher," he said. Fecher said Monday the public employees retirement system has a larger estimate of the potential impact of the bill than the teacher retirement system because the public employees retirement system's investment portfolio has a larger share of direct investments. Rhoden said in an email dated Feb. 26 to Sen. Ricky Hill, R-Cabot, who is HB1307's Senate sponsor, and Wardlaw that he believes the bill is not needed in order to cause the teacher retirement system to do the right thing. "The ATRS Board, for years, has instructed the investment consultants to not use factors related to environmental, social justice and governance (ESG) as the basis for an investment recommendation," he wrote in an email obtained under under the Arkansas Freedom of Information Act. "The Board follows current Arkansas law to make investments following the 'prudent investor' rule, the requirement for diversification, and to make investments solely on a risk/reward analysis as a fiduciary to the members of ATRS." The system's annual investment returns are often ranked in the top 10% of all national public pension systems due to the adherence to these sound investment policies and "I would hate to see the annual returns reduced by passage of this bill that includes the retirement systems of Arkansas," Rhoden said. The retirement systems are already required by Arkansas law to make investments based solely on financial factors, and including the teacher retirement system in this bill is not necessary and puts the retirement benefits of 130,000 members and their families at risk, Rhoden said. "Please consider amending HB1307 to add an exemption for the Arkansas retirement systems" to mirror West Virginia's bill and "[t]hen we could deal with ESG investing issues, like proxy voting, specifically for the Arkansas retirement systems in a separate bill," he said in his email to Hill and Wardlaw. West Virginia has a bill that could be used as a model, Rhoden said, but Hill said Monday he doesn't plan to amend the bill in order to exempt state government's retirement systems. Robyn Smith, executive secretary of the Arkansas State Highway Employees Retirement System, said in an email dated Feb. 22 to Hickey that in "consultation with the other State Systems and review of what has resulted in other states, our conservative estimate of losses could range anywhere from 10 basis points or $20.1 million over 15 years to 70 basis points which would be about $140.6 million over 15 years." Smith said Monday the highway employees retirement system's investments are valued at about $1.5 billion. David Clark, executive director of the Local Police and Fire Retirement System, said in an email dated Feb. 22 to Hickey that "a conservative estimate for LOPFI is a potential cost of $1 million/a year." Clark said Monday the system's investments are valued at about $2.5 billion. Under the amended version of HB1307, an ESG oversight committee would be created to determine a list of financial service providers that discriminate against energy, fossil fuel, firearms or ammunition companies or otherwise refuse to deal based on environmental, social justice, and other governance-related factors. The committee would comprise four citizens of the state with the governor, attorney general, House speaker and Senate president pro tempore each appointing one citizen and the state treasurer or his designee under the bill. The state treasurer would be required to maintain a list of financial service providers as determined by the ESG oversight committee on the state treasurer's website under the bill. In determining whether to list a financial services provider on the list, the state treasurer, under the direction of the attorney general, would be required to consider and may rely upon specified information under the bill. The state treasurer would be required under the bill to divest the state of all direct or indirect holdings with a financial services provider included on the list published on the state treasurer's website, and a public entity would be required to divest itself of all direct or indirect holdings with a financial services provider included on the list published on the state treasurer's website.
