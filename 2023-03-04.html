         A Scott County man died in flooding near Waldron, according to a press release from the Scott County Sheriff's Office. The Sheriff's Office reports it was alerted early Friday morning that the man was supposed to meet his grandson on Manorcrest Road but had never arrived and had not returned home. Deputies searched the area and tried to track the man's cellphone, but both efforts proved unsuccessful. After water levels began to recede later that morning, a motorist traveling on Arkansas 248 reported the top of a pickup visible in the Poteau River, according to the release. Deputies and other first responders went to the area and discovered a heavily damaged truck unoccupied and mostly submerged. Upon searching the area, first responders found the man's body a short distance from the truck just before 8 a.m., the release says. The Sheriff's Office said the initial investigation indicates the truck was likely swept from the road and into the river near Arkansas 80 and Manorcrest Road. The man's identity is not being released at this time.  Print Headline: Scott County man dies in flooding Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        Over 1,000 students at Little Rock Central High School walked out in protest of Gov. Sarah Sanders' LEARNS Act on Friday. This comes after students released a letter to the governor about her invocation of Central High history in her speeches and legislation. Over 1,500 students, alumni, parents and staff have signed the letter, which takes a stance against the bill. "By siphoning funds and resources away from public education and into the private sector, the ambition of our disadvantaged students and hardworking faculty will be stifled," the letter stated. "Governor Sanders' intent to imitate policies similar to those of Florida's anti-LGBTQ+ legislation will suppress the free expression of personality. "School choice policies which will favor upper-class families would create unequal opportunities for lower-income students. "Reforms that attack school coursework deemed too inappropriate for students will dramatically decrease their preparation to face real-world social issues." Senate Bill 294, also known as the LEARNS Act, is the Republican governor's education initiative, an omnibus bill that would allow students to use state funds to attend a private or home school and set a $50,000 minimum starting salary for teachers. LEARNS stands for Literacy, Empowerment, Accountability, Readiness, Networking and Safety. The bill also includes provisions against the "indoctrination" of students with critical race theory that the bill describes as conflicting with the principle of equal protection under the law or encouraging students to discriminate against someone based on characteristics protected by federal or state law. The bill passed the House on a 78-to-21 vote Thursday. The Senate will still need to vote to concur with the House's amendment to the bill before it heads to the governor for her signature. At the protest on Friday, student council President Steve Abochale said the Young Leftists organization at Central High contacted the council about organizing a protest after reading Sanders' bill. "I want to -- not just to set an example about what to do -- I want us to set an example about how to help," he said. "I think Central High School is one of ... We are kind of the example. I feel like if we do this, to bring awareness, not only will we bring awareness to the bill, we will also bring support from other public schools because this affects other public schools. It's not just us. It's the LRSD, this is such a big matter and if we can bring awareness to even just one school, then our job is done." Abochale said if this bill "keeps up" then the state will "be regressing back to private school domination." Abochale's sister Mimi, who is also on the student council, said education is very important to her and she wanted to make a change. "The goal is to shed light on the hypocrisy of the Arkansas government," she said. "The bill wants to cut teachers' pay for their master's, they don't want to pay for their master's, and the cuts are just giving money to the more elitist institutions like private schools, while kids who choose to go to public school, they're not getting the benefits that they deserve." She said Central "will not be quiet" and "will always fight for our school and freedom to teach." Kimberly Crutchfield, a psychology, sociology, civics and economics teacher at Central, said she's been fighting against the bill since it was made public. "I'm supporting our kids, show their voice, show what they want their communities and their schools to look like in the future," she said. Public education, Crutchfield said, is an equalizer to help people move out of the economic status they were born in. "If you don't have great public schools, you take away that option," she said. "It also helps us come together, learn each other's perspectives on life. It is a true democracy in action in the public school level. So I believe in public education, I believe in the kids being able to voice their opinions. I believe, in funding education, special ed, public ed, and I believe in the choice, too, for kids to go to private school, parochial schools, or charter schools, that is their choice, but public education should be funded by public dollars and not the other entities." Johan Gonzalez, a member of the Young Leftists organization, said the LEARNS Act "attacks" fundamentals that minority groups stand for. "We do have a voice and we're not afraid to use it, because it's really important to stand up for what you believe," he said. "And we're really doing this to motivate other high schoolers to also take the same actions." Gonzalez said the school plans to protest again Wednesday at the state Capitol after school about 4:30 p.m. The governor's office did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

         Meteorologists confirmed on Friday that overnight damage to as many as 30 homes in Pike County was the result of a tornado. According to a bulletin on the National Weather Service's website, Pike County officials reported 20 to 30 homes were damaged or destroyed. Multiple chicken houses were also destroyed and "numerous" trees were blown down. The National Weather Service in North Little Rock confirmed Friday afternoon that survey teams had determined that a tornado was responsible for the damage in Kirby. The service said in a social media post that the damage was consistent with a higher end EF-2 tornado. An EF-2 tornado is measured at having 3-second wind gusts between 111 to 135 mph. Repeated attempts to reach officials in Pike County for details Friday were unsuccessful. Volunteer firefighters and deputies rescued two people from a Miller County residence that collapsed from damage caused by a tornado that struck southwestern Arkansas on Thursday evening. The rescue workers got the two people out without injury, said Michael Godfrey, director of the Miller County Office of Emergency Management. The NWS North Little Rock office could confirm that a tornado struck Miller County sometime between 5:45 and 6:30 p.m., but could not provide further details Thursday, said Joe Goudsward, a senior forecaster with the service. "We've been pretty lucky," Godfrey said. He praised the work of the volunteer firefighters who were clearing downed trees and tree debris from Tennessee Road east of Texarkana late Thursday and had extinguished a fire that started when a tree fell across power line on U.S. 237 south of Texarkana. A possible tornado also left minor damage in Grant and Dallas counties, officials said. In Grant County, the area that was put under a tornado warning around 12:45 a.m. started in southeast Leola and tracked northeast from there, said Randall Berry, emergency services coordinator. "We've been fortunate so far, but so far we've not had any reports of any damages," Berry said. "We've had a couple of trees down on roadways. All of those have been cleared except for one and we just got a report of that one. So we're working on that but we haven't had any reports of any major damage." Deputy Jordan Ables with the Dallas County sheriff's office said only minor damage happened there. It primarily involved power lines, gas lines and timber near the small community of Cooney, located on Arkansas 229 between Leola and Garland. Shortly after 2 p.m. Friday, Entergy Arkansas reported about 1,300 customers without power. The highest number of outages were in Pulaski County, 246. By 8 p.m., those numbers had fallen to 412 statewide and 50 in Pulaski County. Police in Hardy, about 115 miles north of Little Rock, asked residents along the Spring River to leave their homes because of flooding, while hail and strong winds were reported in Oklahoma. The storm hit Arkansas and Louisiana late Thursday after it marched across Texas. More than 72,000 Texas customers and more than 42,000 in Louisiana remained without electricity Friday, according to PowerOutage.us. No deaths or injuries were reported in Texas and Louisiana.

         Little Rock police on Friday began letting residents and businesses register or directly integrate their security cameras with the agency's Real-Time Crime Center in what officials described as phase two of implementing the new technology in the city. The rollout plan, called Connect Little Rock, gives residents or business owners who already have doorbell cameras or other security cameras the option to share the footage captured by their cameras with police in one of two ways, neither of which would involve police regularly monitoring their footage, said Maj. Ty Tyrrell, head of the agency's Headquarters Division. The first way is to register a camera with police through connectlittlerock.org, which simply lets police know a camera is present at a given location, without giving officers access to live or recorded footage from it, Tyrrell said. If a crime occurs, investigators can contact the camera's owner and ask to review the footage. Even if they register their cameras, people are not obligated to share the footage. Footage can be shared by email, and police will only save a copy of the video if it is thought to contain worthwhile evidence. "They tell us when and how they want us to access their cameras," Tyrrell said. The second option, which is geared toward businesses that are likely to have numerous cameras, is to directly integrate their cameras with the crime center at police headquarters on Markham Street. This is done by plugging a box-shaped device from Fusus, the company that makes the software that powers the crime center, into the security system's DVR, Tyrrell said. Fusus' software allows police to create and monitor a digital map of the city with the location of police patrol units, surveillance cameras and reported crimes. Cameras directly integrated in the crime center's system using these boxes, which Fusus calls cores, give police access to the live camera feed, letting them give information to first responders in real time, Tyrrell said. However, police will only view the live feed when it is thought that a crime is occurring, he said. On Friday night, the connectlittlerock.org site showed 472 cameras integrated and 10 registered. Practically all of those integrated cameras are city-owned cameras that have been connected to the crime center since it launched last August, while the handful of registered cameras, which include ones owned by police Chief Heath Helton, have largely been used to test the system, Tyrrell said. The hope is that the number of registered cameras will rise sharply as residents buy in to the program, Tyrrell said. Helton previously said he hopes to have 4,000 cameras registered with the system by the end of the year. The number of directly integrated cameras should rise as well, Tyrrell said, as schools and other large businesses in the city join the initiative. The Little Rock School District has about 4,000 cameras, he said, and the district has expressed interest. To directly integrate cameras, a school or business would buy one of the Fusus cores to connect to their security system's DVR, Tyrrell said. The department has about 45 Fusus boxes available for small businesses in high-crime areas that may not be able to afford one otherwise, he said, but they will expect larger businesses to meet them halfway by buying a box themselves. The Fusus website did not publicly list prices for the cores, but Tyrrell said he thought the price was several hundred dollars. One advantage of businesses using their own cores is that they would have access to an app that gives them a higher level of control over the cameras integrated with police, said Sgt. Troy Dillard, who commands the crime center. "The beautiful thing about this for people we partner with is that they get to control which cameras we have access to," Dillard said. Some business owners may not want to connect the cameras in the rooms they count cash in, or hospitals can elect to give police 24/7 access to external cameras but only allow them to view interior cameras when there is an emergency there, Dillard said. Dillard was optimistic about adoption of the new system over the coming months, he said. "We've been getting buy-in from the people we've talked to," he said. The information provided by the surveillance cameras, when used in tandem with technology like license plate-reader cameras that are already connected to the system, can give officers and firefighters on the ground a wealth of information before they arrive on scene, which can change the way they respond, Tyrrell said. "If we understand a situation better before we walk in the door, you're always gonna get a better response," he said.

        A Summit Utilities Inc. customer in Arkansas has sued the natural gas supplier, claiming price gouging and mismanagement of monthly billing procedures. The lawsuit was filed Thursday in Pulaski County Circuit Court on behalf of Little Rock resident Robert Weyrens and all 425,000 Summit customers in Arkansas. Thousands of the utility's Arkansas customers have already lodged similar criticisms of Summit's billing. The lawsuit seeks court approval to review the company's billing procedures and correct errors, according to Little Rock attorney Scott Poynter, who filed the suit. "We need to identify all the problems and then figure out how to solve those problems," Poynter said Friday. Summit, based in Colorado, purchased the natural gas distribution system in Arkansas from CenterPoint Energy Resources Corp. in April 2021 and completed a conversion of ratepayers to its system in December 2022, according to the suit, which has been assigned to Circuit Judge LaTonya Austin Honorable. "Since then, Summit has utterly failed to appropriately provide utility gas service to its customers in Arkansas, and moreover, has price-gouged them with substantial over-billing, and further manipulated their billing methodology," the suit says. Summit has established a billing system that is confusing customers by not clearly stating new monthly charges and improperly accounting for prior payments, Poynter said. "The system is a complete mess," he said. The suit says customers have complained that "their gas bills with Summit have skyrocketed by several times their normal average" since January. "Folks are saying their bills have at least doubled and I'm seeing triple and I'm seeing quadruple," Poynter said. "This is a problem with Summit and the integration of their systems and ... it looks like price gouging." Summit declined to comment on specifics of the suit but said it continues to work directly with customers to resolve problems. "Many of the complaints received seem to be related to the high commodity cost of gas," Brian Bowen, Summit's director of external affairs, said in a statement Friday. Prices to buy on the open market for a cubic foot of gas are up from 38 cents per cubic foot in 2020 to $1.22 today, Bowen said. Customer complaints against Summit have cited soaring monthly charges and poor handling of billing and payments since the company began conversion to its systems from CenterPoint in November 2022. And they're not slowing down. For example, Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin's office reported about 650 customer complaints had been received by Feb. 1. That number has grown to 2,500 complaints, the office reported Friday. Likewise, complaints against Summit filed with the Arkansas Public Service Commission have surged since the utility took over billing. Also on Feb.1, the Public Service Commission reported about 250 billing complaints filed by Summit customers. That ballooned to 615 by Friday. While Summit contends natural gas pricing on the open market is largely responsible for the billing increases, there have been few complaints from customers of the four other providers in Arkansas. The attorney general reports five complaints filed since Nov. 1 -- all against Black Hills Energy, which serves Northwest Arkansas. The commission reports 18 total complaints -- 10 related to Black Hills and eight against Arkansas Oklahoma Gas Corp., which serves western Arkansas. Poynter said his office has received 364 customer complaints since news of the lawsuit was first publicized Thursday. The Public Service Commission could open a docket to examine Summit's billing, though it has not done so. "The Commission is currently assisting customers with complaints and continues to investigate the issues," spokesman Jeff Hilton said Friday. "No decision has been made at this time on whether a formal docket will be opened." Summit, Poynter said, has simply bungled the billing conversion process and is overcharging customers. Some customers have been saddled with "thousands of dollars in gas bills" and they're concerned about their ability to pay, he said. "It's almost like it's extortion," he said. Most immediately, Poynter said he will ask Honorable to halt customer disconnections while the case is under review. Exorbitant bills are burdening customers and stirring anxiety over keeping their homes heated, Poynter said. "There are people with thousands of dollars in gas bills and they're worried ... they're not going to be able to cook or take a hot shower or keep the heat on if we get another cold snap," he said. Summit said in a notice Friday afternoon that it has suspended disconnections. "In light of our transition to new customer service and billing systems, we voluntarily suspended disconnecting customers and charging late fees last fall," said the notice from Chief Executive Officer Kurt Adams. "That suspension will continue through the winter. Before lifting that suspension, we will give customers ample notice." The notice was emailed to Poynter after this newspaper asked Summit whether it would suspend disconnections. In the email, Adams also said customer issues in Arkansas are related to problems with the billing conversion and market prices. Summit did not respond when asked if the notice was sent to all customers, though it is addressed "To Our Valued Customers." "Complications with the implementation of a new computer system, combined with the unusually high energy costs this winter, have been annoying and frustrating to our customers," Adams said in the notice. He also noted that market prices have declined recently. "As a result, we expect that when we file at the end of this month your cost of gas will come down," the email said. Summit is required to make filings with the Public Service Commission every April 1 and Nov. 1 to outline the cost it pays for gas. Summit said its gas rates are regulated and approved by the Public Service Commission and the charges are passed through to customers at the same cost the utility pays. "As a utility, Summit does not profit from the cost of gas," Adams' note said. "Our customers pay what we pay." Customers also contend that the utility is not properly accounting for payments when they are made and that Summit is registering them for automatic withdrawals that the customers did not approve. "It looks like Summit doesn't know where the money is," Poynter said. Summit did not follow up to requests to respond to those allegations. High bills led Jacksonville resident Gary Standridge to completely shut off his heating system for two weeks in February. He said Friday he was still billed more than $300 for the month. Standridge adjusted his usage after receiving a $366.43 bill for January. "I was just absolutely shocked when I got my January bill," Standridge said Friday. "I can't sustain paying those kinds of prices; nobody can." Despite reducing usage in February, Standridge said his bill for the month was $316. An October 2022 study by the U.S. Energy Information Administration projected natural gas bills for residential users would rise sharply this winter, which it defined as the period from October 2022 through the end of March. "We expect households that use natural gas as the primary space heating fuel will spend about $930 this winter, 28% more than they spent last winter," the study said. "Our forecasted increase in natural gas expenditures is the result of both higher expected prices and consumption." The analysis also projected that residential gas costs in the South would increase 15% this winter. Arkansas residents are protesting their Summit bills exceed those projected cost increases. Summit's pricing "reeks of monetary graft," Jacksonville resident Standridge said in a complaint filed with the attorney general. "Summit Utilities, and whoever is in charge of their pricing, [is] bankrupting all of us with these unsustainable price gouges," Standridge said in a two-page letter. All Summit customers in Arkansas -- unless they choose to opt out -- would be included if the class filing is approved by Honorable. That approval should be simple to gain, according to Poynter. "This is the kind of case that is perfect for a class," Poynter said, noting that his firm has specialized in class-action filings for more than 20 years. Summit owns natural gas distribution and transmission subsidiaries that operate in Arkansas, Colorado, Maine, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas. It operates utilities that serve customers of Arkansas Oklahoma Gas, Colorado Natural Gas, Summit Natural Gas of Maine, Summit Natural Gas of Missouri and Summit Utilities of Arkansas.

         Last year, the Concordia Choir sang at St. Peter's Basilica, their praises filling the Vatican City landmark. This year, they're visiting smaller houses of worship a little closer to home, including Bentonville First United Methodist Church at 7:30 p.m. Tuesday, St. James United Methodist Church in Little Rock at 7:30 p.m. on Wednesday and Fort Smith First United Methodist Church at 7 p.m. March 14. The Tuesday performance will be in collaboration with the choir from Bentonville High School. "We're excited to share the music that we've been rehearsing since August with audiences up and down the United States," said Michael Culloton, the Concordia Choir's conductor for the past three years. "The majority of the program is a sacred program with our roots as a college of the church," he said. There are a few secular selections as well, including a new arrangement of Bob Dylan's "The Times, They Are A-Changin'." Founded by Norwegian immigrants in 1891, Concordia Choir has Evangelical Lutheran ties and a host of ecumenical friends, with stops also scheduled at Episcopal, Presbyterian and United Church of Christ congregations. The 2023 tour began Feb. 25. By the time the choir returns to its Moorhead, Minn., campus March 19, it will have performed in locations from Sioux Falls, S.D., to San Antonio -- eight states in all. Under previous directors, the choir made frequent stops in the Natural State, Culloton said. "I've never been to Arkansas, so this is going to be the maiden voyage for me, personally, but I know that we're going to come and sing for three really awesome audiences who are going to enjoy the work of these young singers immensely," he said. The choir is more than an entertainment source; it's also an effective recruitment tool. Eager for the choir to be heard by young people, Concordia College is allowing students to attend their Arkansas performances free of charge. Adults are charged admission of $20 to $25. "It's been fun for me to know a couple of students who heard the choir in Arkansas and came to study at Concordia, and so we hope for the same thing [this time]," Culloton said. "We have room in our quota for Arkansas students to come study here." Breck Cogswell attended a Concordia Choir concert in Fort Smith in 2013 when she was a self-described "certified choir nerd" at Southside High School. Inspired by the sound, she eventually enrolled at Concordia College. By the time the choir returned to Fort Smith in 2018, she was a member. Now an alumni, she's currently enrolled at Wartburg Theological Seminary in Dubuque, Iowa, preparing to become an ordained Lutheran minister. She's delighted to see Concordia visiting her hometown yet again. "I think it is beyond awesome that the choir makes a point to have Fort Smith on their regular tour cycle, every five years-ish," she said. "[First United Methodist Church] is such a special place, with wonderful acoustics for singing and even more wonderful people who are excited to listen to the tour concert and meet the students every time." Culloton, himself a 1998 Concordia College graduate, says the music conveys a timeless message. The words to many of the songs are lifted from the Bible, with passages borrowed from Psalms, Isaiah and 1 John. The first set includes Felix Mendelssoh's "Warum toben die Heiden" (Why do the nations rage?), J.S. Bach's "Lobet den Herrn, alle Heiden" (Praise the Lord, all ye nations) and Knut Nystedt's "I Will Greatly Rejoice." A subsequent set is devoted to songs extolling the Virgin Mary while another is titled "Of Angels and Alleluias." Some audiences will also hear "Beautiful Savior," a song sung at the Vatican during last year's Italy tour. At the Lutheran school, songs of praise are part of a long tradition. "I like the freedom that comes with working at an institution where we can unabashedly sing sacred music," Culloton said. "I heard a fellow say recently that we preach a changeless Christ for a changing world and I thought, 'That's great. We sing of a changeless Christ for a changing world.'"

        FAYETTEVILLE -- Extensive rules being written will resolve many of the concerns about the governor's education bill, lawmakers told a forum in Fayetteville. Rep. Robin Lundstrum, R-Elm Springs, expects rules to prevent fraud and abuse of the bill's home-schooling provisions to be among the most extensive of all the implementing regulations currently being drafted by the state, she said. Lundstrum and Rep. Steve Unger, R-Springdale, met with constituents at a forum organized by the Fayetteville Chamber of Commerce The chamber's "Face to Face with Your Legislators" events are held at 4 p.m. each Friday while the Legislature is in session. The events take place at the chamber's "Fab Lab" Innovation Center on the town square in Fayetteville. Other rules being drafted should prevent "school skipping" under the school choice provisions of the bill, Lundstrum said. "We don't want parents getting mad at the basketball coach and pulling their kid out of school," she said. The bill's provision giving all public school teachers a raise is not getting enough emphasis, audience member Adella Gray of Fayetteville told the lawmakers. Gray is a former Fayetteville City Council member. There is a widespread impression that only teachers who are below the bill's new $50,000 a year minimum salary would get a raise, she said. Page 73 of the 145-page amended bill includes this provision: "For the 2023-2024 school year, each teacher shall be paid a salary that is at least $2,000 greater than his or her current salary as of September 1, 2022." Senate Bill 294 containing the governor's education package passed the House on Thursday and goes back for concurrence and final passage next week. The state's Board of Education and Education Department face a challenge to write all the needed rules implementing the bill in time, Lundstrum acknowledged in an interview after the forum. Many of the bill's provisions would start with the next academic year. The legislative session is on track to adjourn in April, most likely in the second week of April, Lundstrum and Unger told the forum. Major legislation on criminal justice reform is expected, they said. There will also be an income tax cut, but the size of that cannot be determined until the education bill and crime bill are through the budget process, Lundstrum said. Lawmakers must know the costs of those before addressing any changes to the state income tax, she said. Suzanne Clark of Fayetteville asked the lawmakers how the state planned to pay for the education package. Lundstrum replied the bill would be phased in and paying for it would be an ongoing process. "This is not like a light switch," all going on at once, she said.  Print Headline: Rules being written will impact education bill, lawmakers say Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        BENTONVILLE -- A lieutenant resigned from the Bentonville Police Department after his arrest in connection with driving while intoxicated. Joseph Luke Rosebaugh, 38, of Gravette, was arrested Wednesday in connection with driving while intoxicated and refusal to submit to a chemical test, according to Cindy Murphy, a spokeswoman for the Arkansas State Police. Adam McInnis, a spokesman for Bentonville police, confirmed Friday that Rosebaugh resigned from the department. Rosebaugh was arrested after the State Police responded to a 7:37 a.m. Wednesday call to Arkansas 102 at Rebel Road. Murphy said the call was in response to a suspicious person. He was booked into the Benton County Jail at 10:54 a.m. Wednesday and released on citation at 11:33 a.m. that day, according to jail records. His arraignment is scheduled for 10 a.m. May 10 in district court in Gentry.  Print Headline: Officer resigns after DWI arrest Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        BENTONVILLE -- A January jury trial is scheduled for a Rogers man accused of killing a 2-year-old boy. Gustavo Enrique Peraza, 31, is charged with capital murder and battery. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges. He faces the death penalty or life imprisonment without parole if convicted of the murder charge. The battery charge is punishable with a prison sentence ranging from 10 to 40 years or life in prison. Peraza is accused of killing 2-year-old Ryland McDonald in 2021. He's being held in the Benton County Jail with no bond set. Benton County Circuit Judge Brad Karren on Friday scheduled jury selection in Peraza's case to begin Jan. 29. A pretrial hearing is set for Jan. 26. The trial is expected to last at least two weeks. Karren presided over a motions hearing Friday. Many of the defense motions are filed in capital murder cases. Karren denied each of the motions asking to prohibit prosecutors from seeking the death penalty. Karren, in denying a motion seeking to declare the death penalty unconstitutional, said the Arkansas Supreme Court has ruled lethal injection isn't a cruel or unusual punishment. Peraza was the boyfriend of Breyana Sawyer, Ryland's mother, according to court documents. He babysat the boy while Sawyer worked, according to court documents. Ryland died Aug. 24, 2021. Police started investigating after being notified of the death by Mercy Hospital. Trauma to the stomach injured the boy's intestines, which led to a serious infection that caused his death, according to a probable cause affidavit. A doctor told police the type of injury Ryland suffered is typically caused by a punch or kick to a child's abdomen and is typically inflicted within a week of death, the affidavit states. Sawyer, 24, is charged with permitting abuse of a child. She pleaded not guilty to the charge. Her next court appearance is scheduled for Jan. 26.

        PRAIRIE GROVE -- Prairie Grove planners gave their approval Feb. 16 for developers to move ahead with concepts for two residential developments that, if approved, eventually would build out to a total of 689 units. Larry Oelrich, city administrative assistant, explained to those at the meeting developers submit a concept plat to see if it is something the city might consider and approve in the future. Approving a concept plat does not approve a subdivision, Oelrich said, but if there is a general agreement in favor of the concept plat, then the developer can move forward with plans to prepare a preliminary plat. COPPER HILL CONCEPT PLAT Jesse Fulcher with Rausch Coleman Homes first introduced his concept for a large planned unit development called Copper Hill PUD at the commission's Jan. 12 meeting. The commission agreed to take the concept plat and look over it before the next meeting. On Feb. 16, Fulcher told commissioners that Copper Hill would be located on an 80-acre property off Butler Road. He said Rausch Coleman wants to provide a variety of house sizes and a variety of price points within the neighborhood. The proposed project has six residential planning areas. In all, the development calls for 599 units: 475 lots for single-family houses, 100 two-story townhouse units and 22 duplexes. Along with residential units, the PUD would have two large park areas, one 3 acres and the other 1.25 acres, as well as a walking trail around an existing pond on the property. The northern end of the development would have more of a traditional feel to it and mirror existing homes in the area, Fulcher said. Smaller lots will be located within the interior of the project. The northwest corner falls behind the backyards of existing homes, so the plan is to keep that as a preserved area out of respect for those neighbors. Fulcher said Copper Hill is probably a 10-year project and it would be about two years before anyone would see a house on the project. House, townhouse and duplex sizes would range from 1,200 square feet to 2,600 square feet. "When you look at the number of lots, it's not something that's going to fall on us tomorrow. You might see 50-60 lots developed 18 to 24 months from now. This is long term," Fulcher said. He also said he believes the development lines up with the city's new comprehensive plan and is a compatible use for the location. "I think these rooftops will support the commercial and industrial growth you're planning to see there on Highway 62," Fulcher said. In addition, he said the new homes will support downtown businesses because the subdivision will be about 2,500 feet from the city's downtown core. Commissioner Brea Gragg wondered if the city could dictate the timing of the phases or the number of houses built in each phase. "As a young family, I love this," Gragg said. "I think it provides something for everyone. But on the other end, and that's our job here, I am concerned about the rate of growth." Commission member Lynn Gregson responded he did not want to place "handcuffs" on Rausch Coleman if the need was there for additional housing. Oelrich said he would talk to the city attorney to see if conditions could be placed on the number of houses per phase as part of the planned unit development. RESIDENTS EXPRESS CONCERNS Some of the concerns expressed by people at the meeting included several who said they were not supportive of some projects built by Rausch Coleman in other cities in Northwest Arkansas and did not want to see such developments in Prairie Grove. One woman wondered if the development would turn into a large-scale rental area. "Are we ready for that?" she said, noting that Sundowner Estates has a lot of rental houses and there are problems with parking on the street. She said she had a little concern with an overflow of transient rentals happening in Prairie Grove. Fulcher replied that if Rausch Coleman used some of the houses for rental property it would be on a smaller scale but he did not anticipate building any of the houses for rentals. He noted, however, that real estate companies might come in and purchase houses for the purpose of renting them. Another man noted that, in his personal experience, smaller houses negatively impact the value of larger houses in a subdivision and that would be the case in the proposed Copper Hill development. Gragg said she supports the project as a planned unit development because the city would have some control over the details of the project. "This is a good, big lot in the middle of town," Gragg said. "It's going to be highly sought after whether you build it, they build it or we build it." Commission chairman J.C. Dobbs noted that the city wants controlled growth, as much as possible. "We do our best to plan so it doesn't encroach upon the neighbor's property and it doesn't harm someone else's property values, keeps the aesthetics of that neighborhood the best it can," Dobbs said. "At the end of the day, growth is coming, whether it be from Rausch Coleman, whether it be from Lindsey, Snyder. Growth is coming to Prairie Grove. We're doing our best to manage it so the city can keep up and the school keep up." The commission unanimously voted in favor of the concept plan. The vote was not unanimous for the concept plat for Parkwood Estates, a development on 20 acres off Parks Street adjacent to Prairie Grove United Methodist Church. The "ayes" had it, but Gragg said "nay" on the motion to approve the concept plat. The commission approved a preliminary plat for Parkwood about a year ago, but in December engineer Ferdi Fouri submitted a new concept plat with 12 more units, from 78 to 90, for the property because of increased costs. The commission voted against this concept plat with several commissioners, including Gragg, saying they thought the density was too high. In January, Fouri submitted another concept plat with very low density, nine single-family lots with about two acres per lot. This also was voted down because commissioners believed it did not fit with the city's proposed land use plan for that area. Fouri returned with both concept plats Feb. 16 and said the developer was asking the commission to approve one of the concept plats but that the developer preferred the lower density proposal with the estate lots. Fouri said the developer believes the estate lots fit in with the other houses on the same side of the street. After some discussion about both concepts, Gregson made the motion to approve the concept plat with the highest density. This concept proposes eight single-family lots and 41 townhouse lots with two townhouses per lot sharing a wall. In other action, the commission approved a conditional use permit for a duplex in a B-2 zone at 10980 Brady Road at the request of Morris Lawson.

        LINCOLN -- The Planning Commission recently approved the city's first new residential subdivision in almost 20 years. The commission on Feb. 3 approved the preliminary plat, with conditions, for Avalon Estates, a single-family development located on 4.76 acres at the corner of West South Street and South West Avenue. The property is owned by Apogree Properties. The preliminary plat shows the subdivision will have 18 residential lots, ranging in size from just over 7,000 square feet to 9,233 square feet. Two lots are set aside for detention ponds. The commission considered the Avalon preliminary plat two times in 2022, and both times it was tabled at the recommendation of the city's engineers from Garver in Fayetteville. The Garver planning staff had concerns with drainage plans, street improvements, design layout and lack of required information. Commission chairman Terry Bryson said the engineering firm for the development had completed enough work on the submitted preliminary plat at the Feb. 3 meeting for it to continue to the next step. Courtney Tannehill-McNair with Garver said the firm this time recommended approving the preliminary plat with 14 conditions. She said Garver believes the conditions can be met at the construction plan stage without affecting the overall design of the subdivision. The developer will have to meet all the conditions before the project can move forward, Tannehill-McNair said. The subdivision will have one entrance from South West Avenue, and this street will end at a cul-de-sac. Five residential lots will have access off West South Street. Bryson said while this is the first new subdivision in many years, Country Meadows subdivision on North Street now is in the process of finishing out that development. Country Meadows was originally approved around 2005 and is the last one approved for Lincoln, until Avalon Estates. "I think it's great," Bryson said. "I'm happy to see it get past this stage of preliminary. Hopefully, houses will start getting built in six months." Bryson said Lincoln, with its new municipal codes, is tightening up its rules to make sure everyone adheres to the updated building codes so Lincoln has quality construction. "Young people come in buying a house, we want to make sure it will last," Bryson said. "They deserve a house that lasts and doesn't fall apart in 10 years. That's not right." In other action Feb. 3, the commission elected officers for the year: Terry Bryson, chairman; Jim Morris, vice chairman; and Belinda Beasley, secretary. Other commission members are Deanna O'Brien, Doug Moore and Harry Swain. Mayor Doug Hutchens serves as advisor.

         PEA RIDGE -- The City Council recently passed a resolution to get the rates charged for ambulance service provided by the Pea Ridge Fire-EMS Department more in line with other ambulance service providers in Benton County. Saying that a city-operated ambulance department is never going to make money, interim Fire Chief Clint Bowen presented a request to the City Council during a work session Feb. 21 to change the rates for the Pea Ridge Fire-EMS Department. "Fire, police, ambulance -- I think the Water Department may be the only department that makes money -- will never be for profit," Bowen said. "We are an advertisement for the type of service you get if you come to the city." "Nationally, fire, police, street departments are not for profit," he said. "Long story short, I had an unofficial committee look at all the billing in Northwest Arkansas. We try to be on par," he said, adding that it is extremely difficult to consider the rates from Northeast Benton County Volunteer Fire-EMS Department as it's not a municipal service. He said that the Pea Ridge rates were too high. Bowen said there were multiples times within about six weeks that there were ambulances from other departments inside the city limits because Pea Ridge ambulance was already busy on a call. He said it didn't seem right to him that the person being served by the out-of-city ambulance would get a lower bill. "What I have asked for here is to get on the same page as NEBCO and Rogers," Bowen said. He presented a chart to council members comparing rates of Bella Vista, Bentonville, Central EMS, Lowell, NEBCO, Pea Ridge, Rogers, Siloam Springs and Springdale. "I've been in the industry for 25 years. It's always been a service," he said. Several specific cases were also brought up concerning walk-ins and other unique situations. Bowen said he is addressing that. Council member Nadine Telgemeier asked: "Will these charges cover our expenses?" "No," Bowen said. "It's never going to," Bowen said. "I don't ever want the career that I love to be a legality. I want to treat people with kindness," he said. During the council meeting that followed the work session, council members unanimously approved a resolution adjusting rates and charges for the ambulance service. The resolution states the rates shall be set "commensurate with elect other ambulance services in Benton County, Ark." It allows for rates to be reevaluated every two years and adjusted as necessary.

        PEA RIDGE -- Council members and Water Utilities Superintendent Ken Hayes came to a mutual agreement concerning discussed temporary water meters Feb. 21 during a council meeting after discussing them at length during a previous work session. The ordinance was approved unanimously with a change from its initial form during the council meeting. Temporary meters are rented to construction companies during construction. The issue has been discussed for several months. The companies receive the bulk rate for the water used. There is a cost for a deposit on the meter. It was agreed to charge a daily rental fee of $7 per day beginning the 61st day of having a meter, thereby allowing no rental fee for the first 60 days. Hayes said many businesses do not keep meters that long. He said they have been used for as little as a week but that one is still out after a year. Hayes said most of the people who get the temporary meters return them in a reasonable time and condition. "I don't need this left up to me," Hayes said. "We operate differently than you do. We're an enterprise fund, and we are required to have a rate study and an audit to recover costs."

        Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders will appoint a veteran law enforcement and military officer, Jeff Long, to serve as director of the Arkansas Crime Information Center, Sanders announced Friday. The Arkansas Crime Information Center is part of the state Department of Public Safety. The center is responsible for providing information technology services to law enforcement and other criminal justice agencies in Arkansas, according to the state government's website. Long replaces Brad Cazort, who said he retired as the center's director Tuesday and Long started work as the center's director the next day. Cazort had worked at the center since 2005 and as the center's director since his appointment in 2017 by then-Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson. Sanders, the Republican governor, said in a news release that Long's impressive, extensive public service career with 36 years in the military and 31 years in law enforcement "will be a tremendous asset in working with our top-notch team at the Department of Public Safety to keep our state safe and secure with reliable, up-to-date crime data." Long's salary was not immediately available through a Department of Public Safety spokesperson Friday night. The Arkansas Crime Information Center's principal role is the administration of a comprehensive data system that is accessible by criminal justice agencies in more than 250 locations in Arkansas, according to state government's website. This state system is interfaced with the FBI National Crime Information Center, as well as similar systems in the other 49 states. The center also collects and publishes statistics on crime, manages the crime victim notification system, and the state sex offender registry. With the exception of crime statistics, access to most data maintained in the center's system is restricted to governmental criminal justice officials for criminal justice purposes, and is specifically exempted from the Freedom of Information Act. Long said he's humbled by the governor's confidence in him to lead the Arkansas Crime Information Center. "I have dedicated my career to protecting Arkansans and Americans from harm, fully equipping me to serve the people of Arkansas in this capacity and support law enforcement agencies with timely, accurate information," he said in the news release issued by the governor's office. "Both Governor Sanders' and Colonel Mike Hagar's strong, tough on crime leadership is exactly what our state needs to reduce violent crime, and I look forward to working together as we empower all Arkansans with a safer, stronger state." Long began his public service by joining the Arkansas National Guard in 1982 while still a junior in high school, and later transferring to the Army Reserves, where he rose to the rank of sergeant major, according to the governor's office.

        A Little Rock woman charged with first-degree murder over the 2021 hit-and-run death of a pedestrian whom she was said to be feuding with saw her bail set at $750,000 Thursday after prosecutors played a video of the victim's final moments in the street and complained that the defendant had skipped court hearings in other cases almost two dozen times. Deputy prosecutor Scott Duncan described 35-year-old Porchia Calloway at the bond hearing a "danger to our community" who has "no regard for authority." He told Pulaski County Circuit Judge Karen Whatley that he had found 23 instances over the past few years where Calloway did not show up for court, mostly on misdemeanor traffic and domestic violence charges, but also during juvenile court proceedings involving one of her sons. None of those instances resulted in criminal charges. Duncan also told the judge that Calloway has a history of threats and violence, stating that Calloway once texted her probation officer to brag that she had anger issues and could hurt the officer. Calloway is on probation for terroristic threatening and second-degree battery and has a pending terroristic-threatening case. Calloway did not testify, but her attorney, Joe Don Winningham, asked for "reasonable" bail, stating that the mother of eight had deep ties to the community, lives on disability and would not be a flight risk. The judge set bail at $750,000, expressing concern over the text message about Calloway's anger. Calloway has pleaded innocent, while Winningham has begun exploring a possible insanity defense by filing the paperwork for Calloway to have a mental examination by state doctors. Calloway has been jailed without bail since her August arrest. Her murder charges, which include first-degree battery and leaving the scene of an accident with death, stem from the November 2021 death of Earlina Counts, a 51-year-old mother of five, who was run over about three weeks before Thanksgiving in front of Pic Pac Liquor at 4407 W. 12th St. Calloway is not accused of killing Counts outright, with Detective Stephen Henry testifying Thursday that Counts was killed by a second hit-and-run driver, whom police have identified as 38-year-old John Terry Hill of Little Rock, who was arrested two days after Counts was run over. He is facing up to 20 years in prison on a leaving-the-scene charge, with his trial set for May. Henry told the judge that a city traffic camera at the intersection of West 12th and Peyton streets that faces the liquor store recorded Counts being struck by Calloway's car, then run over by Hill's pickup. Played twice in court for the judge, the video shows Counts walking across the street toward the liquor store when she is struck by a white sedan the detective said was driven by Calloway. The car appears to veer toward Counts, who is in the turn lane. Counts begins moving back to avoid the car, but the vehicle steers sharply to follow her as she puts her hands on the hood just as the car knocks her down in the street. As Counts lies writhing on the street, the sedan then turns around past her, drives back west on 12th Street in front of the store and turns into the parking lot, then exits to pull up with its bumper next to the stricken woman. Someone gets out of the passenger side of the car, looks across the hood at the woman briefly, then gets back into the sedan, which then drives over Counts' legs as she tries to crawl away. The sedan turns north onto Peyton and leaves the camera view. Counts is left squirming in the street. One westbound car drives around her, but then a white pickup drives over Counts and drags her out of camera view. The video lasts about three minutes, with barely 1½ minutes -- 96 seconds -- elapsing between the time Counts is first hit until she is run over by the pickup. Counts' left leg was broken and her ankle crushed, the detective said. Henry told the judge that police searched the neighborhood for the sedan, which he said had distinguishing damage on its roof, in the days after Counts was killed. Detectives found the car, a white 2005 Kia Amanti, about four blocks away, in front of Calloway's home, 1023 Madison St. Henry testified that he spoke to Calloway, telling her he was there about something that had happened a week earlier and asking whether she knew what he was talking about. Calloway said she did, telling Henry that her cousin and a friend had borrowed her car that night, which Henry told the judge seemed noteworthy because he had not said anything about her car. The detective also said that he had talked to 40-year-old Asher Satterfield, an occasional boyfriend of Calloway's, who said she had told him about deliberately running over a woman on 12th Street that she had been feuding with, whom she said was named "Lisa." Satterfield told him that Calloway told him she had run over Lisa's ankles with her car, describing how Lisa had then tried to stand up before falling, the detective said. Satterfield said that Calloway warned him that if he told anyone what he'd said, she'd do something to him, Henry testified. Court records show that Calloway has been on probation since November 2019, when she pleaded guilty to two counts each of second-degree battery and terroristic threatening for an April 2019 arrest in North Little Rock, where she had attacked firefighters and emergency medical technicians who had come to help her. She sprayed them with pepper spray, as well as punching others and threatening to shoot them, according to a police report. Rescuers had been called to Calloway's then-residence at 217 E. 18th St. for some type of medical emergency, but she got belligerent from the start, then fought off their efforts to calm her down so they could see if anything was wrong with her. She threatened to shoot them, acting as if she had a gun on her, the report said. Calloway, who complained she was having trouble moving one of her legs and appeared to have trouble breathing, locked herself in the house, resulting in a standoff that ended when police broke down the door and arrested her. She was taken to the hospital before being jailed that same day. A terroristic-threatening charge is pending from her next arrest in March 2020 in Little Rock, based, in part, on a cellphone video and surveillance footage that shows her threatening 52-year-old Steve Brown, the branch manager at the Arkansas Federal Credit Union at 1221 S. Shackleford Road. According to police, Brown had asked Calloway to leave after she got mad at a teller and caused a scene because a hold had been put on a $1,200 check she had deposited. Police said Calloway punched Brown in the back of the head and threatened to shoot him. She later denied making any such threat or striking him. Since then, she's also pleaded guilty to misdemeanor public intoxication five times as well as misdemeanor counts of disorderly conduct and criminal mischief. In one of those cases, police found Calloway drunk with no shoes or pants in March 2020 in front of the Lovely Nails Salon, 6323 Colonel Glenn Road, where she had thrown up into a sink. Shortly before she was arrested in the murder case last August, police found her naked and flailing her arms in the street at the intersection of 11th and Madison streets, and she beat on the patrol car and dented the right rear quarter panel.

        More than 50 transgender rights advocates gathered in front of the Arkansas Capitol on Friday to protest a bill that aims to make it a crime for a person to knowingly remain in a bathroom of the opposite sex while a minor is present. Protesters sang, heard from speakers and demonstrated against Senate Bill 270, which some opponents have said would create the most extreme anti-transgender law in America if enacted. At one point, demonstrators placed pieces of toilet paper bearing photos of lawmakers in a wastebasket decorated as a toilet to express their opposition. "What do we do with transphobia," asked Tien Estell, advocacy coordinator for Intransitive Arkansas, while leading a chant. "Flush it down," responded the crowd. The bill's sponsor, Sen. John Payton, R-Wilburn, has said the measure is needed to protect children. Payton told the Senate on Wednesday he considers the legislation to be a compromise and noted it would cover "transgender" and "heterosexual" people. "The bottom line is this bill does not make it illegal for somebody to use the wrong bathroom if it does not match up with their sex unless there is a child present," he said. Sarah Everett, policy director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas, told demonstrators Friday that her organization would keep up its opposition to the bill. "We at the ACLU of Arkansas with all of you will do everything in our power to prevent this from becoming law and, if it does, to prevent it from taking effect," she said. "We're not going anywhere." While speaking against the bill during a meeting of the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this week , Everett said no other state has a criminal ban against transgender people using restrooms. Five people spoke against the bill and one testified in favor of it during the meeting. After the panel advanced the legislation, Payton pulled it from the Senate floor Wednesday to address a drafting error. The bill is scheduled to reappear in the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday. Ally Thomlinson, with Disability Rights Arkansas, urged demonstrators to participate in the legislative process. "You are the experts on the trans experience," Thomlinson said. Payton's bill would generally criminalize instances where a person 18 or older knowingly "enters into and remains in a public changing facility that is assigned to persons of the opposite sex while knowing a minor of the opposite sex is present in the public changing facility." It includes exemptions for parents accompanying minors, people rendering medical assistance, law enforcement officials accompanying a person in their custody and people authorized to maintain and inspect facilities. Along with Payton's bill, lawmakers have reviewed at least one other bill which opponents say could affect bathroom access for transgender people. House Bill 1156, by Rep. Mary Bentley, R-Perryville, would require public schools and open enrollment public charter schools to designate multiple occupancy restrooms for the exclusive use of either the male or female sex. Bentley's bill was pulled from the Senate floor earlier this month to allow for amendment. It has since been referred to the Senate Committee on Education. The American Civil Liberties Union is tracking at least six pieces of legislation in other states which could impact access to facilities including public restrooms and locker rooms, according to the organization's website.

         Dear Saint Asphalt: I have a great idea for our General Assembly while it's in session. Change the law to make the right lane the passing lane, thereby clearing the left lane of all who feel they must be in the passing lane at all times. -- Your Friend Dear Friend: Ha! Arkansas Code Annotated 27-51-301 tells us that vehicles shall not be driven in the left lane except to pass. Unless, duh, the right lane is, as is said in golf about the ground, under repair. Note also the numerous signs put up along interstates that say "Slower traffic keep right, dadgum it." Dear Mahatma: As I was traveling over the zig-zagged bridge over the Arkansas River heading into Little Rock we approached the area where the lanes are choked down. I was almost sideswiped by a giant pickup with some ridiculous tires that stuck out way too far. Going back, back, back in time I recall getting a citation while driving my 1969 GTO because the tires stuck out beyond the fenders. I seem to recall if the tire was outside the fender more than an inch you could be cited. Is that law still in effect? -- Ronnie & the Daytonas Dear Ronnie: We asked Jeff Holmes about this. He's chief of the Highway Police, a division of the Arkansas Department of Transportation. The only restriction on vehicle width, he said, is that it can't be wider than 102 inches. We looked up the width of the most registered vehicle in Arkansas, the Chevrolet Silverado, which is right at 81 inches. Those would have to be some seriously big tires to add 21 inches. Next time, stop the dude and measure. Ha! We jest. Regarding the 1969 GTO, too bad it's long gone. We found one near St. Louis, fully restored, orange, beautiful. Right at a quarter-million dollars. Ha! We kid you not. Regarding Ronnie & the Daytonas, they had a hit with "Little GTO" about 1.2 million years ago, in the 1960s. Dear Mahatma: Speaking of construction on Interstate 30 in Benton, there is a sign that says, "Warning! High voltage wires overhead," or something like that. What, pray, are drivers supposed to do? Put their left hands in their pockets? -- Larry Dear Larry: Ha-ha, as Dave Barry used to write. (Barry, for those late to class, was a newspaper humorist. Google his column on colonoscopies, in which he coins the phrase "behindular zone.") Gosh, Larry, your question tickled some zone in David Nilles, a frequent source for this column at the Arkansas Department of Transportation. He gives a logical answer, unlike ours, which had something to do with crop dusters. Those signs, Nilles reported, are for the construction workers who operate heavy equipment in the construction zone. Some of that equipment may be capable of reaching above those wires -- cranes, concrete pourers, bucket trucks and such. The signs remind the workers of the danger above.

        100 YEARS AGO March 4, 1923 BENTONVILLE — All funds stolen from the State Bank of Decatur Wednesday afternoon were reported recovered when the alleged robbers were captured a few hours later after the robbery, but a recheck made by Decatur Bank officials yesterday showed a shortage of $380. The shortage is in silver, and as none of the three bags recovered showed evidence of having been opened, it is believed an additional bag may be hidden in the woods. A search of several miles of territory traversed during the chase has failed so far to yield the lost money. 50 YEARS AGO March 4, 1973 TEXARKANA — B oth sides of this border city will pay tribute to a native son next month as part of their centennial celebration. The recipient of the honor is Scott Joplin, father of ragtime, who was born at Texarkana in 1868. The tribute will take the form of a story music concert in ragtime, sponsored by the Texarkana Community School. It will be held at 2:30 p.m. Sunday, April 8, at the Texarkana Community College auditorium. 25 YEARS AGO March 4, 1998 HUGHES — Faith. Faith. And faith. Those are the three themes of Robert Duvalls new cinematic masterpiece, “The Apostle.” And it was conceived right here in Arkansas. Somehow that doesnt surprise. For this isnt just any old story. This is a story that grew — root, branch, and leaves — from the soil of Southern evangelism. “The Apostle” doesnt condescend to its subject or its audience, but elevates both—by respecting both. … You neednt be attracted or put off by the kind of religion being portrayed to be intrigued by it. Its enough to recognize that Mr. Duvalls character—The Apostle E.F.— has a faith profound, and a sense that Gods always around. Its a sense that Robert Duvall felt among the people of Hughes, Arkansas. It was 13 years ago, and he was studying for another role when he wandered into a church there. Intrigued by the power and sincerity of the faith he saw, he started visiting other places of worship throughout the Delta. “I probably visited between 80 and 100 churches,” he said. 10 YEARS AGO March 4, 2013 The University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences will open a special psychiatric unit Friday designed to meet the treatment needs of women with acute mental illness. Many patients on the 10-bed unit will be treated for conditions such as depression and anxiety that have been triggered by events such as pregnancy and menopause, doctors said. “There are enough very gender-specific issues that impact the treatment of depression and anxiety for this patient population that we just think that offering a place for a focused assessment and treatment of women makes a lot of sense,” said Dr. Lou Ann Eads, who will oversee the unit in the UAMS Psychiatric Research Institute. Unlike other units, which serve patients of both sexes, the new womens unit will have expanded family visitation times, and it will allow patients to nurse newborn infants, Eads said.

         Police: Bryant man found with bombs North Little Rock police on Thursday arrested a man who they say had two pipe bombs, a gun, body armor and drugs in his vehicle during a traffic stop, according to an arrest report. Around 11 p.m. Thursday, officers tried to pull over a Dodge Nitro driven by a man later identified as Christian Barrow, 43, of Bryant because the Texas license plate on the vehicle was registered to a Ford pickup and had tags that had expired in 2001. Barrow did not stop immediately, driving slowly before stopping in the parking lot of the Hilltop Inn at 3100 Main St., where officers noticed a box of ammunition in the glove box as Barrow got the vehicle's title. Barrow is a convicted felon and cannot legally own ammunition. As Barrow stepped out, police saw an empty holster on his hip, which he told police he used to carry a flare gun, which officers found in the pocket on the driver's door. A flare gun can potentially be used to fire 12-gauge shotgun shells and is classified by law as a firearm, which felons cannot legally own. Police also detained and later arrested Jenny Martin, 41, of Sherwood, a passenger in the vehicle. While searching the vehicle for weapons, officers located a soft body armor vest similar to armor used by police, which Barrow cannot legally own. Later, Barrow said he got the armor a while ago from a woman near Camp Robinson. The search also revealed two suspected pipe bombs wrapped in tape and with a fuse protruding. After clearing the area, an explosive ordnance disposal team confirmed that the bombs were intended to produce dangerous shrapnel on detonation and secured them. Police then found a loaded Heckler & Koch 9mm pistol and bags containing about 40 grams of suspected methamphetamine. The search also turned up a digital scale, empty baggies, a glass pipe and 24 $100 bills. Barrow is charged with multiple felonies -- two counts of possession of a firearm by certain persons and one each of simultaneous possession of drugs and a gun, criminal acts involving explosives, criminal possession of body armor, methamphetamine possession, forgery and drug paraphernalia possession. He was held Friday night in the Pulaski County jail, an online inmate roster showed. Martin faces felony charges of possessing methamphetamine and drug paraphernalia. She was held in the Pulaski County jail Friday night in lieu of a $15,000 bond, the inmate roster showed. Report: Man said machine gun his A Little Rock man faces felony gun charges after he admitted to having a machine gun during a Thursday afternoon traffic stop, according to an arrest report. Little Rock officers pulled over a vehicle that Kendal Bone, 20, was a passenger in about 4 p.m. A Pulaski County jail employee had redacted the location of the arrest from the report. Police smelled and saw marijuana, leading to the discovery of a gun in the glove box that was fitted with a "switch" that enabled it to fire fully automatically. Bone told police the gun is his. Bone faces felony charges of possession of a firearm by a certain person and criminal use of a prohibited weapon. He was held in the Pulaski County jail Friday night in lieu of a $25,000 bond, an online inmate roster showed.

         FAYETTEVILLE -- One person died and three more were treated at a hospital for smoke inhalation and burns after a fire broke out at a home Friday morning. A call about a structure fire at 2250 N. Hummingbird Lane, southwest of Township Street and Old Wire Road, came in at 5:12 a.m. Friday. Firefighters could see heavy smoke and flames upon arrival, said Fire Capt. Andrew Horton, deputy fire marshal. Several people were in the front yard saying someone was still inside, he said. Firefighters made their way inside and found one man dead, Horton said, adding that he appeared to have succumbed to injuries suffered in the fire. Two men and a woman were taken to Washington Regional Medical Center. One person suffered burns and all inhaled smoke, Horton said. All three got out of the house on their own, and one was able to get to a neighbor's house to call 911, he said. The fire was extinguished by 7 a.m. No firefighters were injured, Horton said. All four people lived at the home. Horton said he wasn't sure if they owned or rented the home. Choice 1 Properties, a limited liability company in Rogers, is registered as the owner, according to Washington County property records. Three cats died in the fire and one cat is unaccounted for, Horton said. A female bearded dragon, about the size of a person's forearm, survived. Animal control officers took the lizard, and an Animal Services staff member is taking care of it. The call was a two-alarm fire, Horton said. The garage was destroyed and most of the house sustained smoke or fire damage, he said. The cause of the blaze is under investigation. "We just don't have anything to go off of yet," Horton said. "It's still an ongoing investigation. We have to put all the pieces together." Police, fire and ambulance personnel were unaware of the condition of the three injured people Friday afternoon. Names and ages of the people involved were not released.  Print Headline: Fayetteville house fire kills resident Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        ASHDOWN — Cloudy skies and a cold wind could not dampen the sense of pride and achievement for Little River County officials Friday as Sheriff Bobby Walraven cut the ribbon on the new jail. “Its a very important moment for the Little River sheriffs office. Its a testament of the support our citizens have for law enforcement. This has been a long, long project, and its long overdue,” Walraven said. Construction on the detention center had several delays due to supply chain issues and wet weather. Work on the outside of the building and the parking lot were the final steps in getting the facility complete, Walraven said. Little River County voters approved a bond in September 2019 to finance the new building and a three-eighths-cent sales tax to help pay for it and a quarter-cent tax for maintenance and operation. The measures went into effect Jan. 1, 2020. The new jail is on U.S. 71 on the north side of Ashdown near Cossatot Community College University of Arkansas. Officials looked at four locations before deciding on the site. The Southbuild Team, which includes Spirit Architecture Group and Smith-Doyle Contractors, constructed the jail. The new jail can house between 60 and 80 inmates. Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         Laugh-wise, Friday's opening-night performance of "Monty Python's Spamalot" at Little Rock's Wildwood Park for the Arts was more than a romp and less than a riot. Wildwood's more-than-able cast sang -- and oh, what a collection of voices! -- and hoofed its way through nearly two dozen songs (music by John DuPrez and Eric Idle, book and lyrics by Idle, "lovingly ripped off from the movie 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail'"), extracting as much, or more, laughter from the audience as could possiby be expected. But there were parts of the second act that dragged and that vim, verve and Moriah Patterson's excellent choreography just couldn't quite save. Kudos all around to Matthew Tatus as King Arthur, Caitlin Secrest (oh, what a voice!) as the Lady of the Lake, Cory Olson as Sir Galahad, Tommie Tinker as Sir Bedevere (and Galahad's mother), Michael Goodbar as Sir Robin and Adrian Hinojosa as Sir Lancelot (and even better as Tim the Enchanter) and particularly Michael Phillips, who does more than yeoman service as Patsy, Arthur's faithful and highly supportive steed, and who gets one of the show's premiere solos, "Always Look on the Bright Side of Life" (an Idle speculation which, of course, he "stole" from "Life of Brian"). And let's not forget the supporting ensemble, including the half-dozen Laker Girls, not quite half-a-dozen minstrels and a bunch of folks shifting from the Camelot casino cadre to a rabble of French stereotypes. Director Bevan Keating interpolates bits and other Python pieces, right down to the Historian's silly walk. All the king's horses, all the king's men, the grail, the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch and, oh, and that killer rabbit, return to the stage at 3 p.m. Sunday and March 12 and 8 p.m. March 10-11 at Wildwood, 20919 Denny Road. Ticket information is available by calling (501) 821-7275 or at wildwoodpark.org.  Print Headline: ‘Spamalot more than a romp, less than a riot Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         Two people died and three more were injured in wrecks on Arkansas roads Thursday, according to preliminary fatality reports from the Arkansas State Police. William Fullenwider, 77, of Magnolia was killed about 10:48 a.m. Thursday when the 2020 Chevrolet Traverse he was driving ran off the west side of U.S. 167 in Grant County. The Chevrolet crossed two private driveways before striking an electrical pole and a tree. Fullenwider and a passenger, Sherry Fullenwider, 75, also of Magnolia, were taken to UAMS by ambulance, where William Fullenwider died of his injuries. A state trooper investigating the wreck reported that it was cloudy and the road was dry at the time. Hannah Cates, 19, of North Little Rock died about 7:55 p.m. Thursday when the 2002 Pontiac she was a passenger in crossed the centerline of U.S. 165 in rural Lonoke County and struck a 2021 Ford head-on. The driver of the Pontiac, 21-year-old Tavion Ellis of Little Rock, and another passenger, Natalya Lawson, 18, of North Little Rock, were hurt in the crash and taken to Little Rock-area hospitals for treatment. A trooper investigating the collision reported that it was raining and the road was wet at the time.

         For more than two decades, when the House of Windsor needed music for royal occasions, James O'Donnell was there to ensure flawless, majestic performances. Since January, however, he has been based in New Haven, Conn., where he serves as a professor in the Yale School of Music and Yale Institute of Sacred Music. Next week, the former organist and master of the choristers at Westminster Abbey is coming to Arkansas' capital city for a residency at Trinity Episcopal Cathedral. On Thursday and March 11, O'Donnell will lead Trinity's choir rehearsals. At 7 p.m. Friday, he'll deliver a public lecture. On March 12, he'll conduct the choir at the 10:30 a.m. Choral Eucharist and the 4 p.m. Evensong, playing its postlude before attending a closing reception. "I think this is going to be a unique and historic event here in Little Rock and, in fact, the whole region," said Colin MacKnight, the cathedral's director of music. Trinity Cathedral, the seat of the Episcopal bishop of Arkansas, was built in 1884. Westminster Abbey was begun by Benedictine monks in about 960. The Abbey is a royal church, a stone's throw from Parliament on the north side of the Thames. Queen Elizabeth I is among those buried there. During his tenure, O'Donnell, 61, witnessed history again and again. "He was the music director for lots of important occasions, including Queen Elizabeth's funeral and the wedding of William and Kate [now the Prince and Princess of Wales]. Important moments in the British monarchy, plus," MacKnight said. On top of that, he oversaw the "regular regimen of daily choral services, concert tours, broadcasts and recordings," MacKnight said, adding, "He's really one of the top, top people in sacred music alive today." A native of Scotland, O'Donnell was an organ scholar at Cambridge University's Jesus College, graduating in 1982. Initially, he worked at Westminster Cathedral, seat of the Catholic archbishop of Westminster, first as assistant master of music (1982-1988), then as master of music. While he was there, the Westminster Cathedral Choir won the 1998 Gramophone Award for Record of the Year for its recording of Frank Martin's Mass for Double Choir and Ildebrando Pizzetti's Requiem. "[It] was the only time that any cathedral choir had ever won it, so that was quite a feather in our cap and it was great to have that kind of general musical recognition," O'Donnell said. In 1999, he was chosen to be the Abbey's organist and master of choristers, the first Catholic to fill the role since the Reformation. At the Abbey, O'Donnell's skills impressed clergy and royalty alike. On multiple occasions, he was presented to the queen. The interactions were brief but lovely, he said. "It was always a thrill to do it," he said. "She was wonderful, I thought. She was great. She was always very smiley and very pleasant and very relaxed, but I rarely had more than a few words with her," he said. The feedback, when he received it, was positive. In April, when O'Donnell announced he was headed to New England, the dean of Westminster, the Very Rev. Dr. David Hoyle, used superlatives to describe his tenure. "In Westminster Abbey we strive for excellence. That is a difficult thing to deliver; it is a hard discipline. Yet, for 23 years, it is precisely what James O'Donnell has given us," Hoyle said. Expressing "profound admiration" for O'Donnell's "breath-taking and sustained achievement," Hoyle concluded: "We have been privileged to listen to the music he has made. Yale [has] chosen well. He has given glory to God." O'Donnell was returning from a visit to the Ivy League school on the day that the queen died. "I was at the airport already when I heard that there was going to be an announcement about her health but they didn't say anything more," he said. "I heard the culmination of the news as I landed in London, some some hours later." The days that followed were busy. "I felt very, very privileged to be directing the music for Her Majesty's funeral," he said. In addition to directing the Choir of Westminster Abbey and the Choir of the Chapel Royal, St James' Palace, he also did the arrangements for two of the hymns that were sung: "The Day Thou Gavest, Lord, Is Ended'' and "Love Divine, All Loves Excelling.'' In the Abbey and all around it, multitudes turned out to pay their respects. "I think she was definitely held in great affection and you got a sense of that during the funeral," O'Donnell said. "It felt like an act of farewell and thanksgiving for a wonderful person, not just a state occasion with formality. It had a real sort of human aspect to it, which was quite tangible." O'Donnell's service to the queen was appreciated by the royal family. Over the holidays, King Charles III named O'Donnell as a lieutenant in the Royal Victorian Order, an award for those who have provided the sovereign with distinguished service. O'Donnell, who gave an organ concert at Pulaski Heights United Methodist Church in 2012, said he's glad to be returning to Arkansas. "I much enjoyed Little Rock. I'm looking forward to it," he said. If you go: James O'Donnell will appear at Trinity Cathedral, 310 W. 17th St., Little Rock, Friday and March 12.

         LITTLE ROCK -- A Texas woman who pleaded guilty to involvement in an altercation aboard a Southwest Airlines flight in which a flight attendant's jaw was broken was sentenced Thursday to five years on federal probation by a judge who questioned why the woman was not charged with a felony. Brenda Marie Aquino-Washington, 22, of El Paso, pleaded guilty in January to a misdemeanor count of assault in maritime and territorial jurisdiction, for which she could have received a maximum prison term of one year and a fine of $100,000. Instead, U.S. District Judge Brian Miller elected to sentence Aquino to the maximum statutory term of five years on probation -- drawing an objection from Aquino's attorney because the sentence exceeded the maximum three-year probation term recommended by the U.S. sentencing guidelines -- and a fine of $250, which is one-half the low-end guideline range recommendation of $500 to $9,500. According to court records, on Jan. 9, 2021, Little Rock police responded to the Little Rock National Airport after being notified of an unruly passenger onboard a domestic flight. Upon arrival, police were told that Aquino-Washington, while onboard the flight from Nashville, Tenn. to San Antonio, Texas, removed her face mask several times and became combative when told to put it back on. Witnesses said Aquino-Washington tossed food in a flight attendant's face, then repeatedly punched her in the face until another flight attendant was able to subdue her and put her in restraints until the plane could land. Aquino-Washington's attorney, KenDrell Collins with the Federal Public Defenders Office in Little Rock, described his client's actions that day as being brought on by what he said was later diagnosed as having bipolar disorder that she is now being treated for. "She's been doing well," Collins said. "She's been working consistently, living her own life and doing all of the things she's supposed to do. I think this is just a situation where probation will be appropriate." "So your argument is this is a mental health event and the first time it happened?" asked Miller. "It's not like she was on notice this could happen and she went on the plane anyway?" Assistant U.S. Attorney Kristin Bryant said her office had struggled with how to charge the offense given the nature and circumstances of the defendant as having had a mental health crisis coupled with the nature of the injuries suffered by the flight attendant, which include constant pain and partial paralysis of her jaw. Bryant did not ask for jail time for Aquino-Washington but instead asked for the statutory maximum of five years probation. "That way we can be assured she is getting mental health treatment," Bryant said. Aquino-Washington, who appeared via video-conference from her home in El Paso, read from a prepared statement to say she was "deeply sorry for the actions I did before my diagnosis."

         If the Arkansas Supreme Court grants the state's motion to dismiss an appeal for new DNA testing in the West Memphis Three case, the request will be filed again in a different county, attorneys for Damien Echols wrote in an Arkansas Supreme Court filing on Wednesday. "Granting of the State's motion effects nothing but delay into the processing of Echols' petition," according to his attorneys. Citing a boxing maneuver meant to tire out opponents, they wrote, "The Court should decline to endorse this 'rope-a-dope' strategy by the State." The issue involves jurisdiction. Echols, along with Jason Baldwin and Jessie Misskelley, were convicted in 1994 of the slayings of three 8-year-old boys -- Christopher Byers, Steve Branch and Michael Moore -- whose bodies were found in a drainage ditch near West Memphis the previous year. Echols was sentenced to death. The homicides occurred in Crittenden County, but Echols received a change of venue to Craighead County, where he was tried and convicted. No DNA evidence ever linked the three to the deaths, and they were released from prison in 2011 after prosecutors allowed them to walk free as part of a deal known as an Alford Plea, which was also entered in Craighead County Circuit Court. An Alford plea is a guilty plea in criminal court. By taking an Alford plea, a defendant does not admit to the criminal act and asserts their innocence, but agrees that the evidence presented by the prosecution would be likely to persuade a judge or jury to find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Since then, the defendants have been trying to clear their names. Attorneys representing Echols petitioned Crittenden County Circuit Court on Jan. 24, 2022, to permit new M-Vac wet-vacuum DNA testing on sneaker laces that were used to hogtie the three boys. This type of DNA testing wasn't available when previous DNA tests were done on evidence from the crime scene, according to the court filing. Crittenden County Circuit Judge Tonya Alexander denied Echols' request in June, stating that he wasn't entitled to the evidence examination, even if it could clear him, because the law only allows incarcerated convicts the opportunity to seek new evidence testing. Echols appealed the decision to the Arkansas Supreme Court. On Feb. 21, Assistant Attorney General Brooke Jackson Gasaway filed a motion saying Echols' appeal should be dismissed because he filed his initial request in the wrong county. "Echols is appealing the Crittenden County Circuit Court's denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus under Act 1780 of 2001," wrote Gasaway. "His conviction, however, was entered in the Craighead County Circuit Court in case number CR-93-540A. "Under Ark. Code Ann. § 16-112-201(a) (Repl. 2016), an Act 1780 habeas petition must be filed in the circuit court where the judgment of 'conviction was entered.' Because Echols filed his petition in the wrong county, this court should dismiss for lack of jurisdiction." But that's irrelevant because both Crittenden and Craighead counties are in Arkansas' 2nd Judicial Circuit, according to Wednesday's filing from Echols' attorneys -- John R. Elrod of Fayetteville, Patrick J. Benca of Little Rock and Stephen L. Braga of Washington, D.C. They cite a 2020 case, Williams v. State, in which the Arkansas Supreme Court confronted a situation where a defendant "alleged that a jurisdictional violation occurred because he entered his plea in Desha County and not in Chicot County, where the crime was committed and the judgment was entered." Desha and Chicot counties are both in Arkansas' 10th Judicial Circuit. The Supreme Court found that this "present[ed] issues of local jurisdiction," rather than "subject matter jurisdiction," according to Echols' filing. Circuit judges have "the authority to preside over proceedings in any courtroom, in any county, within the judicial district for which that judge was elected." The parties can't waive a court's lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, according to Echols' attorneys. They note that Prosecuting Attorney Keith L. Chrestman agreed to waive venue for the purpose of the circuit court hearing before Judge Alexander in Crittenden County in June. "[V]enue and jurisdiction, though sometimes used interchangeably, are two distinct legal concepts," Echols' attorneys wrote, citing a 1994 case, Davis v. Reed. "Venue is the geographic area, like a county, where an action is brought to trial. Jurisdiction is the power of a court to decide cases and presupposes the control over the subject matter and parties."

         PEA RIDGE -- The city hasn't decided to levy an advertising and promotion tax yet, but the subject is still being considered. Opinions differed during the Feb. 21 City Council meeting and work session on the need to levy such a tax on restaurants and lodgings and to create an advertising and tourism promotion fund and commission for the city. An initial ordinance to levy the tax failed by a tie vote with the mayor abstaining, thereby not breaking the tie. A second ordinance was adjusted to tax lodging only and not restaurants. That measure was tabled. "I make a motion to table this so that we can at least talk about this at our next work session if it hasn't gone through legislation," council member Cody Keene said. "We need a little more time." "I have a lot of questions," council member Nadine Telgemeier said. "Thank you for the discussion and for having an open floor and that everyone felt comfortable to discuss," Mayor Nathan See said, as the meeting adjourned. There was lengthy discussion during both the work session and the City Council meeting. Ray Easley spoke to the council during the work session opposing the tax. "I don't think we have any hotels, motels and ... as far as I know, my wife and I have the only event center in town," Easley said. "It's nonprofit ... it just covers costs. We don't do children's birthday parties -- that's very messy." He said the Pea Ridge trade area extends from Avoca to Longview and Powell, Mo., and he does not believe the city should tax those people. "I don't think we're ready for it. I don't think we're a tourist destination. There are other things the money could be going for," Easley said. The mayor said the state legislature is considering a bill which would change advertising and promotion commissions and require the establishment of the advertising and promotion tax to be considered in a general election. He said the ones in existence would be grandfathered in. "If you don't have one and try to create one, it will have to go to a general election," See said. "Any time we start talking taxes from a council and not an election, you really need to keep in mind," council member Jeff Neil said, "a tax is a tax is a tax -- and I think we need to keep that in mind." Council member Ginger Larsen said she has looked into the issue "a lot" and said it sparks her interest. She spoke to the city attorney and questioned creating the commission and taxing only lodgings not restaurants. "I am for lodging," she said. "I don't necessarily want to put a hamburger tax on the restaurants." "Do we have any Airbnb?" council member Steve Guthrie asked. City building official Tony Townsend said there were several in town, but the city does not maintain a list of them. "Where I struggle is that the people are constantly asking why we don't have certain amenities. You've got to find a way to fund it. We are growing," Telgemeier said. "People are always asking why we are behind. I struggle. This could be an option." "If we adopted the lodging side ... we will collect because there are Airbnbs," Larsen said. "It will be minimal, but it puts our foot in the door. ... I think a business should have to pay a tax." She said the restaurant tax would affect the residents who live in the city and trade here more than it would people passing through. "I think if you're asking for a tax on the restaurant side, it's different than on the lodging side," Larsen said, adding that she truly believes Pea Ridge will eventually have a hotel. Neil said, "You keep saying 'behind' -- I don't understand the 'behind.' What are we behind? We're not going to generate enough off of that to do anything." Council member Merrill White said that the construction of a 300-acre compound on the east side of Bentonville by Walmart will affect Pea Ridge. "Those people are going to have to go somewhere," White said. "It's on the east side. It puts them right here in our back yard. ... I think everything here in Pea Ridge -- police, fire, streets, water, housing -- will see a difference." Neil said that if the council does not approve it, the voters of the city can enact it at a later date. "At this stage, you have the ability to get out in front of it," White said. "It's not that you're going to have a crystal ball and be able to see into the future, but we've got enough understanding of what's going on in our communities and what could potentially come this way. "In my world, we deal with this stuff every day. ... Pea Ridge is the perfect anchor community," White said. "I honestly believe that if the governing body ever had an inclination ... your window of opportunity is closing." Asked about how much money a 1% tax on the restaurants would generate, City Clerk Sandy Button told council members she receives three checks a month from businesses that sell alcohol by the drink and the checks range from $120 to $180. "One of the things a mayor is supposed to do is bring economic development to the city, and I think this helps, and I think it is a proactive stance," Telgemeier said. The ordinance was voted upon with Larsen, Telgemeier and Guthrie voting in favor of it and White, Keene and Neil opposed. White asked about starting with just lodging, saying the restaurants in town would not generate much income. "I just don't think the juice is worth the squeeze," he said. "I don't think we would receive enough revenue off it." "I think you will be getting more than you think, and some is better than nothing," Larsen said. "I think it needs to be on both," Telgemeier said of taxing lodgings and restaurants. "I think we're selling the restaurants short. Just to be ahead of 'big brother.'" "But we don't want to become 'big brother,'" Neil said. "I want to control our own ... you have to promote yourself," Telgemeier said. "It's hard. I can't say this is an easy vote." Easley said, "Think about the hard-working people that live on very little money after they pay all their bills." "I'm a hard working person," Larsen said. "I think it will affect every single person in this city whether we're living a comfortable lifestyle or not. We get to choose." The new version of the ordinance taxing only lodging was read, then tabled.  Print Headline: Council members vastly differ on enacting tax Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         LINCOLN -- The city will hold a special election May 9 to ask voters to allow it to pay off the public library bond issue and then issue new bonds to demolish the community building on Lincoln Square and build a new one in its place. The ballot also will ask voters to continue a 5/8-cent local sales and use tax with proceeds to be used to refund the library debt and pay off a 2023 community building bond issue. The council on Feb. 21 unanimously passed an ordinance calling the May 9 special election. If approved by voters, the city will refund the $450,000 owed on the library and issue a new bond issue of $3.8 million for capital improvements on Lincoln Square. The 5/8-cent local sales tax has a sunset clause and is scheduled to be dropped when the 2012 library bond issue is paid off, but city leaders are asking voters' permission to continue the tax for another community project. Kevin Faught with Stephens Inc. financial firm in Fayetteville said Stephens would be the underwriters for the bond issue transactions if voters approve the questions on the ballot. Faught said the ballot will have two questions, and both must be approved for the city to move forward with the project. If both questions are approved, the bonds would be issued in July. The ordinance approved by the council states that if both questions are approved, the existing tax will be abolished at the proper time so that the existing tax and the new 2023 5/8-cent sales tax will not be in effect at the same time. The current community building has been deemed a public hazard and has been closed to the public since November 2022 because of major structural problems. After inspecting the building, a structural engineer reported the building was not safe to occupy. Council member David McBride said he wanted to reassure the community that the city would renovate the community building if it was possible. McBride said his original priority was to save the community building on Lincoln Square, but after looking at the building's major structural problems, he said he realized there was "no way" to keep it. Ideally, McBride said, someone would step up and offer the city millions of dollars to save the building but he didn't see that happening. Mayor Doug Hutchens said renovating the community building is not a feasible and practical use of the taxpayers' dollars. "This is what progress looks like," Hutchens said. "Sometimes you have to give up the old to get the new." The city has entered into a contract with WER Architects for a plan on replacing the building. In a preliminary opinion, WER estimates it would cost around $55,000 to abate and demolish the current building and from $1.5 million to $1.7 million for a new community building. In other action, the council approved: An ordinance authorizing the mayor to enter into a contract with Orr Construction for a price not to exceed $293,000 for a project to complete water bores. Orr Construction was the only company willing to provide an estimate to bury four water mains that are partially above ground and at risk for damage or failure, according to the ordinance. Hutchins said water bores are needed because of problems from flooding last year. The city will use money from its Water Utility Account to pay the contract. An ordinance appropriating $24,400 to purchase 10 sets of turnout gear for Lincoln Fire Department. The city has applied for a $15,000 grant from the Arkansas Rural Community Grant Program and, if received, this grant would be used to pay the balance for the turnout gear. The total cost of the 10 sets is $39,400. A resolution authorizing the mayor to execute documents for funding from the Arkansas Natural Resources Commission. A resolution to amend city code that designates five places where the city posts its ordinances for the public to view. These five places are the city courts building, city water department, public library, Lincoln Post Office and Lincoln Fire Department office.

        Meteorologists confirmed on Friday that overnight damage to as many as 30 homes in Pike County was the result of a tornado.  According to a bulletin on the National Weather Service's website, Pike County officials reported 20 to 30 homes were damaged or destroyed. Multiple chicken houses were also destroyed and "numerous" trees were blown down. The National Weather Service in North Little Rock confirmed Friday afternoon that survey teams had determined that a tornado was responsible for the damage in Kirby. The service said in a social media post that the damage was consistent with a higher end EF-2 tornado. An EF-2 tornado is measured at having three second wind gusts between 111 to 135 mph. More details were expected to be released this afternoon.  Gallery: Storm damage in Arkansas 3.3.23 Volunteer firefighters and deputies rescued two people from a Miller County residence that collapsed from damage caused by a tornado that struck southwestern Arkansas on Thursday evening. The rescue workers got the two people out without injury, said Michael Godfrey, director of the Miller County Office of Emergency Management. The National Weather Service's North Little Rock office could confirm that a tornado struck Miller County sometime between 5:45 and 6:30 p.m., but could not provide further details Thursday, said Joe Goudsward, a senior forecaster with the service. "We've been pretty lucky," Godfrey said. He praised the work of the volunteer firefighters, who were clearing downed trees and tree debris from Tennessee Road east of Texarkana late Thursday and had extinguished a fire that started when a tree fell across power line on U.S. 237 south of Texarkana. A possible tornado also left minor damage in Grant and Dallas counties, officials said. In Grant County, the area that was put under a tornado warning around 12:45 a.m. started in southeast Leola and tracked northeast from there, said Randall Berry, emergency services coordinator. "We've been fortunate so far, but so far we've not had any reports of any damages," Berry said. "We've had a couple of trees down on roadways. All of those have been cleared except for one and we just got a report of that one. So we're working on that but we haven't had any reports of any major damage." Deputy Jordan Ables with the Dallas County sheriff's office said only minor damage happened there. It primarily involved power lines, gas lines and timber near the very small community of Cooney, located on Arkansas 229 between Leola and Garland. The National Weather Service in North Little Rock has dispatched survey teams to assess damage and confirm whether tornados did touch down. That information wasnt expected until late this afternoon. Shortly after 2 p.m. Friday, Entergy Arkansas reported about 1,300 customers without power. The highest number of outages were in Pulaski County, 246. Police in Hardy, about 115 miles north of Little Rock, asked residents along the Spring River to leave their homes because of flooding, while hail and strong winds were reported in Oklahoma. The storm hit Arkansas and Louisiana late Thursday night after it marched across Texas. More than 72,000 Texas customers and more than 42,000 in Louisiana remained without electricity Friday, according to PowerOutage.us. No deaths or injuries were reported in Texas and Louisiana after the storm slammed California earlier in the week with as much as 7 feet of snow.

        Over 1,000 students at Little Rock Central High School walked out in protest of Gov. Sarah Sanders LEARNS Act on Friday. This comes after students released a letter to the governor about her invocation of Central High history in her speeches and legislation. Over 1,500 students, alumni, parents and staff have signed the letter, which takes a stance against the bill. “By siphoning funds and resources away from public education and into the private sector, the ambition of our disadvantaged students and hardworking faculty will be stifled,” the letter stated. “Governor Sanders intent to imitate policies similar to those of Floridas anti-LGBTQ+ legislation will suppress the free expression of personality.” “School choice policies which will favor upper-class families would create unequal opportunities for lower-income students.” “Reforms that attack school coursework deemed too inappropriate for students will dramatically decrease their preparation to face real-world social issues.” Senate Bill 294, also known as the LEARNS Act, is the Republican governors education reform initiative, an omnibus bill that includes state funds that students could use to attend a private or home school and set a $50,000 minimum starting salary for teachers. LEARNS stands for Literacy, Empowerment, Accountability, Readiness, Networking and Safety. The bill also includes provisions against the “indoctrination” of students with Critical Race Theory that the bill describes as conflicting with the principle of equal protection under the law or encourages students to discriminate against someone based on characteristics protected by federal or state law. The bill passed the House on a 78 to 21 vote yesterday. The Senate will still need to vote to concur with the Houses amendment to the bill before the bill heads to the governor for her signature.  A post shared by LRCH Student Council (@lrchstuco)  At the protest on Friday, student council president Steve Abochale said the Young Leftist club at Central High contacted them about organizing a protest after reading Gov. Sanders bill. “I want to — not just to set an example about what to do — I want us to set an example about how to help,” he said. “I think Central High School is one of … We are kind of the example. I feel like if we do this, to bring awareness, not only will we bring awareness to the bill, we will also bring support from other public schools because this affects other public schools. Its not just us. Its the LRSD, this is such a big matter and if we can bring awareness to even just one school, then our job is done.” Abochale said if this bill “keeps up” then the state will “be regressing back to private school domination.” Abochales sister Mimi, who is also on the student council, said education is very important to her and she wanted to make a change. “The goal is to shed light on the hypocrisy of the Arkansas government,” she said. “The bill wants to cut teachers pay for their master's, they dont want to pay for their master's, and the cuts are just giving money to the more elitist institutions like private schools, while kids who choose to go to public school, theyre not getting the benefits that they deserve.” Abochale said Central “will not be quiet” and “will always fight for our school and freedom to teach.” Kimberly Crutchfield, a psychology, sociology, civics and economics teacher at Central High. said shes been fighting against the bill since it was made public. “Im supporting our kids, show their voice, show what they want their communities and their schools to look like in the future,” she said. Public education, Crutchfield said, is an equalizer to help people move out of the economic status they were born in. “If you dont have great public schools, you take away that option,” she said. “It also helps us come together, learn each others perspectives on life. It is a true democracy in action in the public school level. So I believe in public education, I believe in the kids being able to voice their opinions. I believe, in funding education, special ed, public ed, and I believe in the choice too, for kids to go to private school, parochial schools, or charter schools, that is their choice, but public education should be funded by public dollars and not the other entities.” Johan Gonzalez, a member of the Young Leftists club, said the LEARNS Act “attacks” fundamentals that minority groups stand for. “We do have a voice and were not afraid to use it, because its really important to stand up for what you believe,” he said. “And were really doing this to motivate other high schoolers to also take the same actions.” Gonzalez said the school plans to protest again next Wednesday at the State Capitol building after school around 4:30 p.m. The governor's office did not reply immediately to a request for comment.

        GREENVILLE, S.C. — Victaria Saxton has willingly played a supporting role in South Carolina's starting lineup, letting talented teammates like Aliyah Boston and Zia Cooke lead the way for the defending national champions. She got a starring spot against Arkansas at the Southeastern Conference tournament. Saxton scored 19 points and Boston had her 79th career double-double with 11 points and 10 rebounds as No. 1 South Carolina improved to 30-0 with a 93-66 victory on Friday. Saxton, whose started 97 of 98 games the past three seasons, loves her role, no matter how big or small. "I just do my job every game, do what I'm here to do," said Saxton, a fifth-year player who finished her best scoring performance this season and a point away from her career high. Saxton's been as vital for the Gamecocks as anyone, coach Dawn Staley said. "Probably the highest praise I can give a player is low maintenance and high performing," Staley said. "V's been with us five years now. ... No complaints, the best teammate, she is our mother hen." The Gamecocks, who've won 36 straight, took control early and used their talented, tall lineup to advance to the SEC semifinals Saturday where they'll play either Mississippi or Texas A&M. Arkansas (21-12) will now sweat things out until Selection Sunday on March 12, on bubble watch as one of the last four teams out according to the latest projections by ESPN.com. Staley thought the Razorbacks had done more than enough to make the field of 68. "I agree with her," Arkansas coach Mike Neighbors said. South Carolina won't have such worries, the last undefeated who reached 30 wins for the sixth time in the past nine seasons. The Gamecocks, who lead the country in rebounding margin, were at it again against the Razorbacks. South Carolina outrebounded Arkansas 74-17 in a 92-46 victory two months ago. The Gamecocks couldn't quite reach that same margin this time, but had a healthy control of things down low with 51 boards to Arkansas' 26. Kierra Fletcher added 12 points for the Gamecocks. Saxton hit eight of 10 shots in 20 minutes. Boston had a season-high five assists and tied her season best with four of South Carolina's eight blocks. Laeticia Amihere scored 16 points, all in the second half, as the Gamecocks poured it on. Kamilla Cardoso had 14 points and eight rebounds off the bench. The Gamecocks' defense bottled up Arkansas' leading scorer Erryn Barnum for a second time this year. She was 3 of 11 for 11 points in the January loss at South Carolina and was 2 of 13 for eight points in this one. Saylor Poffenberger had 22 points to lead Arkansas. BIG PICTURE Arkansas: It won't be a comfortable week or so for the Razorbacks, who have lost nine of their last 13 games after opening the season 17-3. Winning 21 games in the rugged SEC is an accomplishment, but will it be enough for Arkansas' third straight NCAA Tournament bid? South Carolina: The Gamecocks got a boost from its two less heralded starters in Saxton and Fletcher. Saxton was active down low as Arkansas concentrated on slowing SEC player of the year Aliyah Boston and Fletcher's scoring offset Zia Cooke's 1-of-10 showing from the floor. NEIGHBOR'S VIEW In Mike Neighbor's opinion, South Carolina is right there with some of the great undefeated championship programs UConn had the past decade. "I've been in it 23 years," he said. "You've got to put them in the conversation with the great UConn teams." KAMILLA'S RISE South Carolina's 6-foot-7 Kamilla Cardoso had her streak of five-games with double-figure rebounds ended with just eight against Arkansas. But the junior believes she's playing up to her potential after scoring 14 points. "I believe I've been more confident," said Cardoso, the ACC freshman and defensive player of the year in 2021. "I feel like my shots are all going in." UP NEXT Arkansas will wait out its NCAA Tournament selection. South Carolina will take on Mississippi or Texas A&M in the tournament semifinals Saturday.

         TEXARKANA, Ark. — Young women from 13 Arkansas public school districts took part in the "Girl Power to the Max" STEM event Wednesday at Ledwell. De Queen-Mena, South Central and Southwest Arkansas Education Cooperatives partnered with the manufacturing for the regional student competition to encourage female participation in technical construction. Twenty-one girls competed. The top three spots granted two first-place winners and a People's Choice Award winner. Kinlee Stivers, a junior at Horatio High School, won first place in computer numerical control, or CNC cutting. Foreman High School sophomore Mallory Abercrombie took first in CNC lasering. People's Choice went to Emily Lewis, a 10th-grader at Mount Ida High School. The winners received trophies provided by Boss Laser, cash awards and $500 tuition waivers from the University of Arkansas Hope-Texarkana. "It's really honestly shocking. I wasn't really expecting it. It means a lot," said Stivers, who built a Razorback bench. Abercrombie said her laser cutting was the fruit of sustained effort. "I'm really excited and proud of myself, because it did take a long time," she said. Lewis claimed People's Choice for a table she built. "I'm really surprised and glad that I got it, because it took a long time to make. In total, with no stopping, it took 72 hours," Lewis said. Ledwell's Community Outreach Director expressed how enthused she was to hold an event like this. "It's huge, and it's a great opportunity for women to get out in the real world and to see they really can do a job in this industry. I think right now at Ledwell, we have five to 10 women in the shops, and so we definitely want more of that," Sarah Carpenter said. The competition was open to any girl in grades 9 to 12 attending a public school within the trio of Arkansas Education Cooperatives invited to the contest. Participants could compete in CNC cutting and CNC lasering technology projects using advanced equipment in welding and power structural systems. The competition was designed to focus on exploring and perfecting skills in high-need, high-wage, high-demand nontraditional occupations, as well as fostering innovation. It served as an extension of what the cooperatives are doing in the classroom. "We had the opportunity to apply for grant funding through the (Arkansas Department of Education's) Division of Career and Technical Education in the way of innovation grant funding. We got together, submitted the application and were awarded $145,000, which we use to purchase equipment such as CNC plasma-cutting tables and CNC laser-cutting tables for districts in our cooperatives that did not have that equipment," said CTE Coordinator Stacey Southerland of the De Queen-Mena Educational Service Cooperative. The event started at De Queen-Mena with 10 girls participating. According to a survey by Southwest Arkansas Education Cooperative, this year's event reached over 125 girls in Southwest Arkansas. Before participating in the event, girls were surveyed and results showed 63% were not interested in pursuing manufacturing careers. After the competition at Ledwell, 74% said they would like to work in STEM or manufacturing-related careers.    Participants in the Girl Power to the Max STEM event pose on a trailer during the competition Wednesday, March 1, 2023, at Ledwell in Texarkana, Texas.

         Hot Springs has more than $40 million of unfunded capital needs and more than $7 million of federal pandemic relief funds. The Hot Springs Police Department made its pitch Tuesday for some of the latter, asking the Hot Springs Board of Directors to consider using the restricted balance in the city's American Rescue Plan Act allocation to purchase an armored vehicle for the SWAT team. The Lenco BearCat is the preeminent armored tactical rescue vehicle, Interim Police Chief Billy Hrvatin told the board. It would replace the 2002 Ford Excursion the SWAT team uses as its "jumpoff vehicle," Hrvatin said. "It has oversized running boards, so guys can offload off of it," he said. "It has no ballistic protection." Officers have been shot at or been at scenes where shots were fired four times in the last eight years, Hrvatin said. "Ballistic protection is a priority for us," he said, noting the SWAT team has responded to 64 critical incidents in the last five years. The $246,000 BearCat Hrvatin requested is built on a Ford F-350 chassis. Its armor is rated for a .50-caliber round. An armored fuel tank, blast-resistant door and top hatch are some of the other features. It can carry up to 12 officers. "It has a stand-alone AC unit in the back, which is very important for guys wearing 25 to 50 pounds of gear in the summertime," Hrvatin said. City Manager Bill Burrough told the board last summer the BearCat would replace the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected, or MRAP, vehicle the city purchased from the Department of Defense in 2014. The inability to find parts has made it difficult to maintain the military vehicle. Burrough told the board Tuesday the MRAP will remain in service. "The MRAP still has a lot of life in it, even though parts are hard to get," he said. Hrvatin said the smaller BearCat is easier to drive than the 50,000-pound MRAP. "It's very easy to operate," he told the board. "It's like driving a truck. It has 360-degree cameras that make it easy to see around you. It's not like driving the MRAP. That takes two people, because you need a navigator to help the driver see." The committee Burrough formed last year to prioritize the city's unfunded capital needs rated an armored recovery vehicle as the most urgent item. It's unclear how the committee determined its rankings. No minutes or attendance sheets were available, and no notices for its meetings were provided. The city clerk's office said none were required, explaining that the meetings weren't open to the public. According to information the city provided, the committee comprised six members of the public: Linda Franklin, Alan Spraggins, Karen Kitchens, Bruce Jones, Todd Green and Mary Curry. The city board will be the ultimate arbiter of how the projects are ranked. It's in the process of developing its own priority list. Hrvatin also requested a Draco Gas Delivery System for the BearCat's breaching arm. The forced air delivery system can put tear gas into a structure or vehicle. "It's initiated by remote," Hrvatin said. "It can put a lot of gas into a house very quickly." He said the ability to deploy gas remotely may have enabled a more expeditious resolution to the 11-hour standoff the SWAT team had at an East Grand Avenue trailer park in 2018. Gas deployed manually was unable to reach the suspect, who was shooting at officers from the back of the residence. "We had a gentleman in a house that would not come out," Hrvatin said. "We breached the front door, and he shot at us. At the time we had no remote delivery option for gas. We had to call the State Police. They brought their BearCat, which had a gas needle. They punched a hole in the wall and got him out of the house." Hrvatin said the remote delivery system costs $21,500. The 2019 police fund budget included $27,000 to equip the MRAP with a breaching arm and gas needle. The city said its ARPA restricted fund had a $1.4 million balance. Department of Treasury rules require ARPA funds to be committed by next year and spent by 2026. Earlier this month the board transferred the $6.74 million unrestricted ARPA balance to the general fund. The money reimbursed the general fund for salaries and benefits. The enabling resolution didn't specify the time period the reimbursement covered. Putting the money into the general fund satisfied the 2024 and 2026 spend-down deadlines. Last year, the city opted to put $10 million of its $11.37 million ARPA allocation into the unrestricted fund. Treasury rules allowed local governments to put up to $10 million into unrestricted accounts that can be used for government services that include road building and maintenance, health services, government administration, police, fire and other public safety services. The city said $3.26 million was spent from its unrestricted ARPA account last year. About half funded the upgrade of the police department's body-worn cameras and in-car video systems.

         A large, winged insect was plucked from the facade of a Walmart Neighborhood Market in east Fayetteville in 2012. Michael Skvarla, a graduate student in entomology at the University of Arkansas, said he didn't know what he had at the time. He went about his shopping with the bug between his fingers. He took it home, mounted it and forgot about it for almost a decade. Skvarla said he thought the insect was an antlion, but he was wrong. In 2020, while teaching a class via Zoom, Skvarla realized the insect from his private collection that the class was studying was a Polystoechotes punctata, also known as a giant lacewing. It was the first giant lacewing recorded in eastern North America in over 50 years -- and the first record of the species ever in Arkansas, Skvarla and J. Ray Fisher wrote in a recent paper for the Proceedings of the Entomological Society of Washington. "Giant lacewings are still extant in western North America in the Rockies and West Coast of the U.S. and Canada," Skvarla said in an email. "I'm not sure they're ever particularly common or abundant, but you can still find them there." After receiving masters and doctoral degrees in entomology from the university in Fayetteville, Skvarla is now director of Pennsylvania State University's Insect Identification Lab. Penn State sent out a news release about the journal article on Monday. Fisher lives in Rogers and also got his Ph.D. in entomology from the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville. He's a research entomologist for Mississippi State University who works remotely from the UA campus in Fayetteville. Fisher said the reference in the news release to the giant lacewing as a "Jurassic-era insect" is a bit of a stretch. He said it's one of about 60 species with an evolutionary lineage that can be traced back to a common ancestor that originated in the Jurassic. And "giant" is only in relation to other lacewings, which are smaller, he said. The specimen Skvarla found has a wingspan of about about 50 millimeters. Ashley Dowling, a UA professor who served as Skvarla's major adviser, said some media outlets had blown things out of proportion by going with "Jurassic insect" headlines. That made it sound like "some prehistoric giant insect" had been found at a Fayetteville Walmart, he said in an email. "In reality, these giant lacewings are common out west and this species used to be more common across the U.S.," wrote Dowling. "I don't think we're going to find folks camping out at Walmart this summer hunting for this insect, but I think some local naturalists will pay a little closer attention to any large lacewing-looking bugs they see." The find brings up the question of whether there is a relic population of giant lacewings in the Arkansas Ozarks. But the bug could have been a hitchhiker, said Fisher. "Most likely this specimen hitched a ride on someone's truck or something when they came from out west," said Fisher. "And it flies to a light at Walmart from the truck." Fisher said he has no official opinion on whether Skvarla's sample was a local lacewing or imported. "I lack an opinion because it's such a curious, fun question," he said. Fisher said efforts were made to take DNA samples from the insect to determine if it was closely, or more distantly, related to the giant lacewings out west. But the specimen was too old, so the effort was unsuccessful, he said. "There's only one way we're going determine it, and that's with more specimens," said Fisher. He said insect identification social media websites like inaturalist.org and bugguide.net have made it easier to track the existence of insects across the country. Giant lacewings were historically widespread across most of North America, but are now thought to be extirpated from eastern North America, with the last specimens collected in the 1950s, Skvarla and Fisher wrote in their paper. "Although the absence of P. punctata records could be due to a lack of collection effort or collected specimens being ignored or misidentified, it seems likely that they really are absent from much of their former range given their large size (50 mm wingspan), attraction to lights, and often considerable collecting effort and expertise concentrated around entomology teaching institutions and biodiversity hotspots such as the All Taxa Biodiversity Inventory in the Great Smokey Mountains," they wrote. "For example, the last specimen collected in Ithaca, New York around Cornell University was in 1890 and it seems unlikely that such a large, interesting insect would go unnoticed by generations of entomologists if it was still present in the area." There are no historic records of giant lacewings in Arkansas, including unidentified or unpublished specimens in the University of Arkansas Arthropod Museum, so the new specimen is the first record for the state, according to the paper. "It is also the first record of P. punctata east of the 100th west meridian since 1951 (Owosso, MI) and first in the Southeast since 1929 (Blood Mountain, GA)," they wrote. "The Ozark Mountains, and the Interior Highlands more generally, are a suspected biodiversity hotspot," according to Skvarla and Fisher. "Dozens of endemic species, including 68 species of insects, are known from Ozarks, and at least 58 species of plants and animals have highly disjunct populations with representatives in the region. However, it is understudied compared to regions of similar biodiversity, such as the Southern Appalachians. This combination makes the region an ideal place for a large, showy insect to hide undetected."  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        An Arkansas Senate committee on Thursday advanced a bill that would require sponsors of proposed ballot measures to collect sufficient signatures of registered voters from at least 50 counties, up from the current requirement of 15 counties, to qualify their measures for the ballot. In a 5-2 vote, the Senate State Agencies and Governmental Affairs sent House Bill 1419 by Rep. Kendon Underwood, R-Cave Springs, to the 35-member Senate. Supporters of the bill said it would require sponsors of proposed ballot measures to get more statewide and rural support for the measures to qualify for the ballot, while opponents said it would violate the Arkansas Constitution and make it more difficult to get proposed ballot measures on the ballot. Sponsors of proposed initiated acts are required to obtain the signatures of Arkansas registered voters equal to at least 8% of the votes cast in the last gubernatorial election to qualify their proposals for the ballot. Sponsors of proposed constitutional amendments are required to obtain the signatures of Arkansas registered voters equal to at least 10% of the votes cast in the last gubernatorial election to qualify their proposal for the ballot. HB1419 would require the sponsors of proposed ballot measures to collect sufficient signatures of registered voters from at least 50 counties rather than the current requirement of at least 15 counties. The number of signatures of registered voters required from these 50 counties would be one half of the designated percentage of registered voters who cast ballots in the last gubernatorial election. Sen. Jim Dotson, R-Bentonville, told the Senate committee the Arkansas Constitution requires sponsors of ballot measures to turn in signatures of registered voters from at least 15 counties to qualify their measures for the ballot and "that's the floor." HB1419 would require sponsors to turn in signatures of registered voters from at least 50 counties "so we would have a broader representation of counties when citizens are collecting signatures and more rural counties throughout the state would be represented in that," he said. But Sen. Clarke Tucker, R-Little Rock, said he opposes the bill, and "I think this plainly violates the language of the state constitution." In 2019, the Legislature referred to voters a proposed constitutional amendment that would have increased the number of counties from which sponsors of proposed ballot measures would be required to collect signatures of registered voters from 15 to 45 to qualify their measures for the ballot, and "the people of Arkansas rejected that in November 2020 in the general election," he said. "This [bill] takes that constitutional amendment, which the people rejected, and takes it up five more counties," Tucker said. "Are we not just flouting the will of the people of Arkansas with this bill?" In response, Dotson said, "I don't believe so." That was only part of the proposed constitutional amendment that voters rejected in the 2020 general election, he said, and another part increased the vote threshold for state lawmakers to refer a proposed constitutional amendment to voters. The proposed constitutional amendment would have required a three-fifths vote of the House and the Senate -- up from the current simple majority vote -- to refer a proposed constitutional amendment to the ballot. The proposed constitutional amendment was Issue 3 on the 2020 general election ballot. That proposed constitutional amendment was much more encompassing than HB1419, which is "streamlined down," Dotson said. "I can't speak completely for what every voter was thinking when they read some language in a ballot proposal that sometimes ... maybe not be quite as clear as what was intended for it to be," he said. "They are two completely different proposals in my opinion." Misty Orpin, executive director of the nonprofit group Common Ground, told the committee that "I do believe that this is a constitutional change and therefore required to be referred to the people of Arkansas" for a vote. She said the Legislature has proposed constitutional amendments more than three times more often than what the people of Arkansas have over the past 20 years. "If you want to stop changing the constitution, stop trying to change the constitution because the majority of the changes are coming from this Legislature, and this bill does nothing to curb the ability of the Legislature to put constitutional amendments on the ballot," Orpin said. Sen. John Payton, R-Wilburn, said he supports HB1419. "I think when an initiative gets on the ballot, it needs to have overwhelming support of the public," he said. Tucker countered that "what this bill is about is saying we don't want the people to get issues on the ballot because we might not like what those issues are, so we want to maintain control, and that's what is happening here." Committee Chairman Sen. Blake Johnson, R-Corning, said "I appreciate this effort, and I want those folks whenever they are trying to amend our constitution to consider my counties in that because every one of them that I represent are small. "I know it is a lot easier to gather signatures in Pulaski County than it is in Clay County and other small counties like Randolph County," he said. "I would like my counties to be among those that are in the signature process." But Sen. Stephanie Flowers, D-Pine Bluff, said she opposes the bill because "I think it is wrong for us to just usurp the power of the people." On Feb. 22, the House of Representatives voted 79-19 to approve Underwood's HB1419 and send it to the Senate for further action. A similar bill -- Senate Bill 260 by Dotson -- cleared the Senate State Agencies and Governmental Affairs Committee on Feb. 16. Like HB1419, SB260, would increase the number of counties from which groups would have to collect signatures from to at least 15 to at least 50. Dotson's bill differs from Underwood's legislation in that it would also increase the required number of signatures from these counties from one-half to three-fourths of the designated percentage of registered voters who cast ballots in the previous gubernatorial election.

        The Fayetteville, Springdale, Siloam Springs and Pea Ridge school districts will see school board races this spring. Several dozen school board seats are up for election May 9 across Northwest Arkansas and the River Valley. The filing period began Feb. 22 and ended Wednesday. In Fayetteville, one board spot is on the line. Heather Clouse is challenging incumbent Keaton Smith for an at-large position. Smith won his first term in 2018. In Springdale, incumbent Michelle Cook is seeking a third term, but Donald Tippett is challenging her for her at-large seat. Cook has served since 2013. She ran unopposed in 2018 for her second term. The only other seat up for election in Springdale is in Zone 2, where incumbent Nick Emerson is running unopposed. He won his first term in 2018. The Rogers School Board's only seat up for election is in Zone 2. Curtis Clements, the incumbent, was the only person who filed to run for the seat. Clements has served on the board for 12 years, the longest of any of its seven members. The Rogers board just hired a new superintendent last year, and Clements said he wants to support him and the initiatives the board has identified. In Siloam Springs, Aric Bergthold and Gary Wheat are vying for the Zone 3 seat. Audra Farrell, who has held the spot since 2016, opted not to run for reelection. And in Pea Ridge Zone 1, Ryan Heckman is challenging incumbent Adam Yager. Yager was elected to the seat last year in a runoff election June 21. Heckman served on the board from 2015 to 2020. In Sebastian County, five school districts each have one seat up for election this spring; in each case, only the incumbent filed to run. The Fort Smith School District has no seats up for election this year. Crawford County has one seat coming open in each of three school districts, but only one person -- Terra Becker in Mountainburg -- filed to run for any of them. All election winners receive five-year terms, unless they are running to fill an unexpired term. Such situations exist when board members resign before their term runs out. All school board positions are unpaid and nonpartisan. Some seats represent specific zones within a district. Other seats are at-large and thus represent the entire district. Most Arkansas school districts hold board elections in May. Some choose November elections, in which case the filing period is in August. Bentonville typically holds a November vote, but that board has no seats up for election this year. Decatur has no candidate for Zone 1, a three-year term. In races in which nobody files, the school board appoints someone.

        HIGHFILL -- The city will spend more than $57,000 on air packs and related equipment for the Fire Department as part of a plan to replace aging air packs. During its Feb. 13 meeting, the council approved an expenditure of $57,697 for the purchase of six Scott X3 air packs, 12 Scott SCBA bottles and six Scott face masks for the department. The council approved the purchase of five new air packs in September 2022. According to information presented to the council by Fire Chief Cody Wynne, the department has 25 air packs that needed to be replaced, so more purchases will need to be made in the upcoming years. In other business, the council approved rezoning 4 acres of land located at 2753 W. Arkansas 12 from rural residential to commercial. The land is own by SK Land Holdings. The council also gave its approval to the final plat of Phase 2 of the Healing Springs Subdivision, land annexed in January. The developer told the council of work with the Arkansas Department of Transportation and the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission to swap land to create a public natural area for future trails in the area of the waterfalls on Little Osage Creek. The council considered a request from Police Chief Blake Webb to purchase a 2021 Dodge Charger with all-wheel drive and only 3,000 miles for $24,500. He said he requested the vehicle because the city needed a spare for use by part-time officers and as a backup should any of the city's aging truck fleet break down. Council member Toby Lester reminded Webb of his previous difficulties with using cars on the city's roads and said he did not support the idea of purchasing another Dodge Charger for use in the city. Webb said the car was not his first choice but that the waiting list is long to purchase a police truck or police vehicle and the car was being offered to the city at a bargain price from a dealer in Claremore, Okla. The council failed to pass a motion to commit to buying a truck when one became available by adding its name to a list to obtain one later in the year. A second motion to purchase the Dodge Charger passed only after Mayor Chris Holland somewhat reluctantly voted to allow the purchase. However, since an ordinance would be needed, the matter was to be brought back to the council at a special meeting for approval, but a decision was later made to lease a Chevy Tahoe and Silverado for the department instead. Discussion of projects Tim Mays of Engineering Services Inc. addressed the council, and discussion was held in regard to three different projects being worked on by the engineering firm: Relocation of water lines for the airport, surveying work on Douglas Cemetery Road for repairs caused by repeated flooding and the route of the sewer line to the Northwest Arkansas Conservation Authority water treatment plant. According to Mays, the city was approved to receive $2.7 million in American Rescue Plan Act funding for the $5.4 million project to run a sewer line to the Northwest Arkansas Conservation Authority plant for water treatment services. He said the city was very fortunate to receive the grant because many applied. The council discussed possible changes in that project to serve customers along Arkansas 264 and then running the sewer line south along Hendrix Road instead of running the line south along the Lick Branch Creek. It was pointed out that the design approved for grant funding was the design that followed the creek south and then used a lift station to pump the sewage to the Northwest Arkansas Conservation Authority plant. Mays estimated it would cost the city an additional $400,000 to follow a route along Arkansas 264 and then south. He said if the sewer system served customers in that area, an additional lift station would be required, adding another $350,000 for the lift station and the forced main. Mays suggested that, in lieu of modifying the entire route, if the city wished to provide service along Arkansas 264, the city put in a lift station and pump sewage to the new forced main for a cost of $400,000 rather than spending $750,000. He said he would hate to build large-diameter forced main where busy roads are because they are under pressure. Since the grant of $2.7 million is a 50/50 grant, the city applied for a $2.7 million loan from Arkansas Natural Resources Commission earlier in February, and that loan application would be on the Arkansas Natural Resources Commission agenda the second week of March. If the city wishes to extend the sewer line along Arkansas 264 to serve other customers, that could be another phase of the project and would require a separate loan application, Mays said. The matter of pursuing an additional phase and additional funding is expected to be on the March council meeting agenda. Tree city designation Scott VanHook, of the Arkansas Department of Agriculture, Forestry Division, addressed the council in regard to becoming a tree city and brought a sample ordinance that the city could adopt to become a tree city. Holland said he would like to strike out language authorizing the city to tell people what they can and can't do on their own lands before the city adopts an ordinance to become a tree city in Arkansas. To become a tree city, Highfill would need to create a tree advisory board and establish practices for the planting, care and removal of trees located on public property. The cost to the city is $2 per capita each year, but in-kind labor and services can be applied to this amount. A proposed ordinance will be prepared for consideration at the March meeting. Cassie Elliott addressed the council regarding the city's trail system and ways to tie into systems in neighboring municipalities and possibly obtaining Trail of Tears designations. Holland said planning a trail system would designate certain trails in the city that developers would build as they develop those lands in the city. Elliott said that having a plan in place could help with grant applications when grant funding for trails becomes available. In other business, the council: Approved an updated agreement with Centerton for animal control services Appointed Matthew Summit to fill a vacancy on the city's Planning Commission Adopted an amended budget for 2022. According to Holland, the amended budget did not add funding to the overall budget but simply adjusted budget line items to reflect expenditures and added funding from unused budget funds to the Police Department for the renovation of the city's new police station. Transferred $2,814 from the Highfill Water Revenue Fund to the city's Fire Equipment Fund.

         Dr. Brian Hyatt stepped down as chairman of the Arkansas State Medical Board Thursday in a special meeting following "credible allegations of fraud," noted in a letter from the state's office of Medicaid inspector general. Members of the board met remotely Thursday with only one item on the agenda: "Discussion of Arkansas State Board's leadership." The motion to approve Hyatt's request to step down as chairman and out of an executive role on the board was approved unanimously. Board members also decided that Dr. Rhys Branman will take over as the interim chairman until an election to fill the seat is held in April. According to the board Thursday, the vacant seats for vice chair and chair of the board will be voted on separate ballots in the April elections. The Medicaid letter states "red flags" were discovered in Hyatt's use of Medicaid claims and process of billing for medical services. In Arkansas, Medicaid fraud resulting in an overpayment over $2,500 is a felony. "Dr. Hyatt is a clear outlier, and his claims are so high they skew the averages on certain codes for the entire Medicaid program in Arkansas," the affidavit states. "The suspension is temporary and there's a right to appeal. I see only allegations and I don't see any actual charges and I haven't dealt with this a lot," said Branman. Hyatt has 30 days to appeal his suspension from the Medicaid program. Other information from the letter shows that Hyatt is alleged to have billed more Medicaid patients at the 99233 code than any other doctor billed for all of their Medicaid patients between January of 2019 and June 30, 2022. Another board member spoke Thursday, but did not identify himself, adding: "There's a process. He's going to go through the same process as everyone else and he's done the responsible thing of stepping aside as chair so that the board can continue to take care of the business we're supposed to without any distractions." Branman joined the discussion, asking Dr. Sylvia Simon how the board has handled instances like this in the past. "We get these [allegations] periodically that are issues with an insurance company, being thrown off of an insurance company or income tax evasion," Simon said. "Until they're convicted of a crime of some sort, we don't do anything with it except monitor the situation. If it's something that has resulted in arrest or could be a direct danger to patients like allegations of molesting patients in the office, substance abuse or things that would pose an immediate danger to patients or the public in general -- then you would consider something like an emergency order of suspension." Hyatt, a Rogers psychiatrist, was appointed to the board in 2019 by former Gov. Asa Hutchinson. Hyatt has not been charged with any crimes. The board said the investigation of Hyatt's allegations is ongoing and they will continue to monitor the situation.

         A House panel on Thursday deferred a vote on a bill intended to address the legal terms "consent" and "forcible compulsion" in sex offense cases. The House Judiciary Committee delayed its consideration of House Bill 1141 to allow officials to assemble reports on how the measure could impact state finances and criminal sentencing. Before postponing action, the panel heard from supporters who said defining consent is integral to addressing sex offenses. An opponent of the bill objected to language he considers unconstitutionally vague, and a lawmaker questioned if the measure would make it harder to prosecute cases. The bill's sponsor, Rep. Robin Lundstrum, R-Elm Springs, pointed to statistics on the prevalence of rape and said lawmakers could aid prosecutors and law enforcement officers by codifying a definition of consent. "We need to ask ourselves what is wrong and how can we fix this," she said. "It's not a reflection on prosecutors or law enforcement. They only work within the parameters we set as legislators." Joyce Short, chief executive officer of Consent Awareness Network, joined Lundstrum in presenting the bill, saying consent is a human right that must be included in law as a civil right. By defining consent, Short said the bill could help Arkansas raise its arrest rate for sexual offense crimes and save the lives of sexual assault victims who may attempt suicide. The bill defines "consent" as "freely given, knowledgeable, and informed agreement by a person who is not physically helpless, mentally defective, mentally incapacitated, or under the legal age to consent." Lundstrum's bill also would redefine "forcible compulsion," a term currently used in courts to determine if a sex offense occurred in a case. Under current law, "forcible compulsion" means "physical force or a threat, express or implied, of death or physical injury to or kidnapping of any person." The bill would expand the definition to include any "bodily impact, restraint, confinement, or threat of bodily impact, restraint, or confinement, whether express or implied" and any "other behavior that results in a sexual act against the will of the person upon whom the sexual act is committed." Rep. Jimmy Gazaway, R-Paragould, said he appreciated the intent of the bill but questioned if the measure could make it more difficult for prosecutors to try sex offense cases by broadening definitions in state code. Having tried rape cases as a prosecutor, Gazaway said he felt defense attorneys would use these extended definitions to their client's advantage. "The more definitions you introduce, the more words you give a defense attorney to play with, the more opportunity they have to pick it apart and argue to a jury that the prosecutor didn't meet this definition," he said. "My concern is that we do more harm by further defining these terms than we would without the definition." Short said the concept of consent "is absolutely germane in determining whether or not a person has been violated." By relying on the term "forcible compulsion," Short said the current law is not doing enough to protect against sex offenses that may not involve violence. Pointing to low arrest rates for sex offense cases, Short said there is "something very, very wrong with how the system itself is viewing whether or not a sexual assault took place." Gazaway said in his experience rape cases aren't always prosecuted because victims change their story or are pressured by others from pursuing a criminal case. In some cases, there may be evidence issues. "There's a number of reasons rape cases don't go forward, but it's not because we lack a definition of consent or we need to redefine forcible compulsion," he said. Prosecutor coordinator Bob McMahon said he was unaware of prosecutors losing sex offense cases because of a lack of definitions. McMahon said the Arkansas Prosecuting Attorneys Association had taken a neutral stance on the bill, which means attorneys may support parts of the bill while not supporting other sections. In a written statement provided by a spokesperson, Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin said, "We are neutral on the bill. However, we agree with prosecutors that it is unnecessary." Rep. Steve Unger, R-Springdale, asked if additional definitions would aid prosecutors in bringing sex offense charges in cases such as a highly-publicized incident where students in the Huntsville School District were accused of having assaulted other classmates. While he knew of the instance, McMahon said he was not familiar enough with the specifics to comment on how the bill might have affected it. Christine Munson told committee members she was a victim of sexual assault and rape and implored lawmakers to pass the bill. "Consent must be recognized," she said. Rep. Andrew Collins, D-Little Rock, raised concerns about how the bill could remove language from state law defining rape as occurring when a victim is drugged or rendered oblivious by intoxication. Short said that what made these cases rape was that the victim was unable to give their consent. Jeff Rosenzweig, with the Arkansas Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, opposed the bill, saying the definition included for "forcible compulsion" was vague and unconstitutional. He pointed specifically to the phrase "any other behavior." "This does not put anyone on notice for what conduct is prohibited," he said. Rosenzweig claimed the bill also would create a consent level that is so high it would "catch a lot of people you didn't mean to." Keith Lindley, a police officer, spoke in favor the bill, saying people accused of committing sexual assault often defend themselves by claiming their victims consented. "They're using language that we have yet to clearly define," he said. "That's why this bill is important." The bill includes provisions that would prevent consent from being used as a defense in cases involving incest. It also would bar consent as a defense in cases involving a school official who uses their position of trust or authority to engage in sexual contact with a student. A jailer who engages in sexual contact with a person in their custody who is not their spouse also would not be allowed to use consent as a defense.

        Fueled by a surge in sales and use tax collections, Arkansas' general revenue collections in February increased by $44 million, or 8.3%, over the same month a year ago to $572.4 million. Last month's general revenues beat the state's forecast by $58.3 million, or 11.3%, the state Department of Finance and Administration reported Wednesday in its monthly revenue forecast. February's total general revenue is the largest amount collected in any February, outdistancing the previous record of $528.5 million in February 2022, said Steve Wilkins, a tax analyst for the finance department. Asked what the February revenue report shows about the state of Arkansas' economy, the state's chief economic forecaster, John Shelnutt, said Wednesday "it shows we are not slowing down at this point and we can't attribute this kind of gain to just inflation or retained savings from the [federal] stimulus programs. "It's real growth in the economy that relates to what we are seeing in the labor markets," he said in an interview. Larry Walther, secretary for the finance department, said Wednesday that revenue growth was above expectations again in February and that demonstrates continued economic growth in Arkansas. "Additionally, tax refunds are on track with the forecast as we enter the busiest months for filing," he said in a written statement. The state's individual and corporate income tax filing deadlines are April 18, according to finance department spokesman Scott Hardin. Tax refunds and some special government expenditures are taken off the top of total general revenue collections, leaving a net amount that state agencies are allowed to spend up to the amount authorized by the state's Revenue Stabilization Act. The state's net tax revenue in February dropped by $4.6 million, or 1.1%, over the same month a year ago to $402.1 million and exceeded the state's Nov. 10 forecast by $55 million, or 16%. February is the eighth month of fiscal year 2023, which started July 1, 2022, and ends June 30. During the first eight months of fiscal 2023, the state's total general revenue increased by $318.2 million, or 6.1%, over the same period in fiscal 2022 to $5.5 billion and beat the state's forecast by $262.7 million, or 5%. So far in fiscal 2023, the state's net general revenue increased by $201.4 million, or 4.4%, over the same period in fiscal 2022 to $4.7 billion and outdistanced the state's forecast by 250.2 million, or 5.6%. In the fiscal session last spring, the General Assembly and then-Gov. Asa Hutchinson authorized a general revenue budget of $6.02 billion for fiscal 2023 -- up by $175.1 million from fiscal year 2022's general revenue budget, with most of the increases for public schools and human service programs. The finance department's Nov. 10 forecast projects a general revenue surplus of $598.1 million at the end of fiscal 2023. Shelnutt said Wednesday that "we are tracking above that by $250 million, so I am not prepared to put a new number out there [for a projected general revenue surplus], but it seems unlikely that we are going to burn through $250 million above forecast, given the provisions that we have for high refund claims coming up and a very low growth in sales tax over the remaining months." In the Aug. 9-11 special session, the Legislature and Hutchinson enacted a four-pronged tax cut package that the finance department projected would reduce state general revenue by $500.1 million in fiscal 2023, by $166.6 million more in fiscal 2024, by $69.5 million more in fiscal 2025, by $18.4 million more in fiscal 2026 and by $8.4 million more in fiscal 2027. The tax cut package accelerated the reduction of the state's top individual income tax rate from 5.5% to 4.9%, retroactive to Jan. 1, 2022, and accelerated the cut in the state's top corporate income tax rate from 5.9% to 5.3%, effective Jan. 1, 2023. The package also granted a temporary, nonrefundable income tax credit of $150 for individual taxpayers with net income up to $87,000 and of $300 for married taxpayers filing jointly with net income up to $174,0000, and adopts a federal depreciation schedule for businesses. The special session in August was held after the state reported accumulating a record general revenue surplus of $1.628 billion in fiscal 2022 that ended June 30, 2022. In fiscal 2021 that ended June 30, 2021, the state reported collecting a $945.7 million general revenue surplus. Prior to fiscal 2021, the state's largest general revenue surplus was $409.3 million in fiscal 2007, when Republican Mike Huckabee was governor for the first part of the fiscal year and Democrat Mike Beebe was governor for the second part of fiscal 2007. In November, Hutchinson proposed a $314 million increase in the state's general revenue budget to $6.33 billion in fiscal 2024, starting July 1, 2023, with $200 million of the increased general revenue earmarked for public schools to help boost teachers' salaries. At that time, he said his proposed budget for fiscal 2024 would represent a 5.2% increase over the current budget of $6.02 billion, leaving a projected general revenue surplus of $254.9 million at the end of fiscal year 2024. Considering inflation was more than 8% last year, limiting the growth of the state's general revenue budget to 5.2% reflects conservative budgeting in these challenging times, he said. During this year's regular session, legislative leaders and Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders haven't yet proposed a general revenue budget for fiscal 2024, which begins July 1, 2023, and ends June 30,2024. Today is the 54th day of the regular session. FEBRUARY'S COLLECTIONS According to the finance department, February's general revenue collections included: A $29.9 million, or 13.1%, increase in sales and use taxes over a year ago to $258.1 million, beating the state's forecast by $27 million, or 11.7%. Most major reporting sectors of sales tax displayed high growth over the same month a year ago, reflecting continuing economic expansion in many sectors. Sales tax collections in retail trade increased last month by 11.4% over the same month a year ago to $92.8 million, and sales tax collections from accommodation and food services, including restaurants, increased by 15.6% over the same month a year ago to $22.1 million. Major vehicle sales tax collections increased by 11.6% over a year ago to $28.9 million. A $2.1 million, or 0.8%, dip in individual income tax collections from a year ago to $262.7 million, exceeding the state's forecast by $13.9 million, or 5.6%. Individual withholding tax revenue is the largest category of individual income tax collections. Withholding tax revenue declined by $3 million, or 1.2%, compared to a year ago to $241.6 million, but exceeded the state's forecast by $5.6 million. The withholding tax revenue dipped because of the lower withholding rates tied to the recent tax reduction. Collections from returns and extensions increased by $0.8 million over a year ago to $15 million, which outdistanced the state's forecast by $6.1 million. Collections from estimated payments increased by $0.1 million from a year ago to $6.1 million, beating the state's forecast by $2.2 million. A $14.1 million, or 199.9%, increase in corporate income tax collections over a year ago to $21.1 million, exceeding the state's forecast by $15.6 million, or 284.2%. The increased collections reflect higher extension and return payments compared to a year ago.

         The University of Central Arkansas will demolish Short/Denney Hall this year, following approval by the university's board of trustees during a teleconference meeting Thursday. Though the university has renovated several residence halls in recent years, the cost to do similar work on Short/Denney Hall would far exceed any of those other projects, making it more fiscally responsible to simply demolish the building, said Houston Davis, UCA's president. In fact, the cost to remediate and renovate the building would exceed the value of the structure. No students live in the building, although a few staff members use it for offices since they were relocated from McAlister Hall due to that building's renovation, said Kevin Carter, UCA's associate vice president for facilities. When those employees move out in early May, work can begin, and the project is expected to be completed in June. The university will perform asbestos abatement and demolition, with Housing and Plant funds used for the project, which is estimated to cost $803,130, according to the university. The three-story residence hall -- one of several dorms on campus -- had been designated for freshmen and "located near Christian Cafeteria and the Student Center, [featuring] double rooms, suite-style bathrooms, free on-site laundry facilities, and a fully furnished community kitchen area." Short/Denney Hall was constructed in the early 1960s, said Fredricka Sharkey, UCA director of media relations. The university has no plans at this time to build another residence hall. Also during Thursday's meeting, trustees approved construction of a new parking lot in Short/Denney Hall's location to better serve the Ronnie Williams Student Center and the Snow Fine Arts center. Anticipated completion is August for the $421,704 project, funded by Plant Funds. Not having parking to serve the Ronnie Williams Student Center and the Snow Fine Arts building has been "challenging," Davis said. The new parking lot is expected to have 80 spots, including some for those with disabilities. Trustees also approved adding a wheelchair ramp at McAlister Hall's south entrance and renovating its first-floor restrooms and lobbies. The $550,000 project, scheduled for December completion, will use Plant Funds and an Arkansas Natural and Cultural Resources Council grant, according to the university. Constructed in 1934, McAlister Hall is home to the Department of Art, the Department of Family and Consumer Sciences, and the Honors College. "We're very fortunate to get [this grant] to do this" project, Davis said. Finally, trustees approved Greek Village Room Rates for 2023-24 with no changes from the current year. The administration recommended continuing the current rates for Greek Village, designed for fraternities and sororities. Carlos Herrera, president of the Staff Senate, Courtney Clawson, president of the Student Government Association, and Kristin Dooley, president of the Faculty Senate, all gave their imprimatur to everything approved unanimously Thursday by the trustees. These moves "reinforce" ongoing efforts by the board of trustees and Davis to do "what is in the best interests" of both students and the university's finances, said Dooley.

         Little Rock police on Thursday afternoon arrested 13 students at Hall High School after a brawl sent another student to an area hospital with minor injuries, police said. Officers responded to a disturbance call at the school, located at 6700 H St., around 12:28 p.m. and found several fights in progress, a tweet from police stated. In addition to the injured student, some property was damaged. The ages and sexes of the students involved were not available, but police spokesman Mark Edwards said he thought the participants were a mix of males and females. He couldn't say for sure what led to the fight. The scuffle caused the school to go into a temporary lockdown Thursday afternoon, said Pamela Smith, Little Rock School District's communications director. Classes resumed after police and school security got the fighting under control, Smith said, but some students called their parents to come get them, and parents were permitted to pick up their students if they wanted. One arrested student faces a charge of inciting a riot, a felony, while the 12 others face misdemeanor disorderly conduct charges, the police tweet states. The students involved will be disciplined according to the law and the school district's student handbook, Smith said.

         On Thursday, the Arkansas Supreme Court affirmed a circuit court opinion that ruled a local attorney could not bring a firearm into the Pulaski County District Courthouse. After hearing the case in early February, the court ruled against Conway attorney Chris Corbitt, 52, who filed a lawsuit against Pulaski County after being turned away from the district courthouse in early January 2020. Writing the court opinion, Chief Justice John Dan Kemp said that Corbitt argued "that the circuit court abused its discretion by denying his petition for writ of mandamus because the plain language of Arkansas Code ... allows him to carry a firearm into a courthouse." Corbitt argued that the code in question, Arkansas Code 5-73-122, authorizes attorneys as "officers of the court" to carry a firearm in any court or courthouse in the state. The defendants in the case argued that it only permits officers of the court to possess a firearm in a courthouse when "authorized by the court." Kemp wrote that the circuit court found "Corbitt failed to show that he had a clear, legal right that had been denied. We agree with the circuit court's conclusion." Justices Rhonda Wood, Shawn Womack and Barbara Webb concurred with parts of the ruling and dissented to parts. When the case was argued before the Supreme Court last month, Corbitt had lawsuits filed against Saline County after being denied entry to the county courthouse while armed; against Arkansas State University over being denied admission with a gun to First National Bank Arena; against the city of Little Rock for being denied admission to City Hall while carrying a gun; and another lawsuit against Pulaski County naming Pulaski County Judge Barry Hyde and Sheriff Eric Higgins as well as Circuit Judge Tim Fox after he was denied entry to the Pulaski County Circuit Courthouse.

         SPRINGDALE -- AQ Chicken House plans to shut its doors this month after 7½ decades of business in Springdale. The restaurant's last day of business at 1207 N. Thompson St. will be March 18, according to manager Kaleesa Sanders. She said she didn't know anything else about the closing. Owner Dick Bradley said in December that there was a pending contract for a company to buy the property, but the company involved was "doing their due diligence" and hadn't yet accepted a deal. Bradley could not be reached Thursday for comment or confirmation of whether that deal has been completed. "This is certainly a sad day for anyone who's ever enjoyed the delicious pan fried chicken or battered fries AQ Chicken is known for," said Bill Rogers, president of the Springdale Chamber of Commerce, in a statement. "While we understand and respect why the AQ Chicken property has been sold, it doesn't mean we aren't already missing this restaurant that is beloved by so many across our state and around the nation." Roy Ritter opened AQ Chicken House in 1947. Ritter later became the mayor of Springdale, according to Angie Albright, director of the Shiloh Museum of Ozark History. The story of the restaurant and its founder represents the way "things all end up tied together" in a growing community like Springdale, from local businesses to city leadership to the poultry industry, Albright said. "I don't think iconic is too strong of a word," Albright said of the restaurant. In the beginning, when Thompson Avenue was still a dirt road, chickens were raised, killed, cleaned and processed right behind the restaurant, according to Kat Robinson's book "Classic Eateries of the Ozarks and Arkansas River Valley." The menu has served chicken in all forms over the years. Some of the signature dishes have included pan-fried chicken, often served with spaghetti, and the AQ Pickle O's, battered and fried dill pickle bites. The restaurant was sold to Frank Hickingbotham and Ron Palmer in 1981, Robinson writes. In 1998, Bradley sold his Lincoln chicken farm to buy the business. President Bill Clinton in 1993 celebrated his 47th birthday with pan-fried chicken at the restaurant and George W. Bush once ordered some AQ chicken from Air Force One, according to the restaurant's website. An AQ location at 1925 N. College Ave. in Fayetteville was open from 1991 to 2016. AQ Chicken Express used to operate next to that location at 1889 N. College Ave. AQ, which stands for Arkansas Quality, is one of a few U.S. 71 restaurants such as Herman's Ribhouse in Fayetteville and Neal's Cafe in Springdale that long predate the arrival of the interstate in Northwest Arkansas. Another such restaurant, Fred's Hickory Inn in Bentonville, was sold last year to new owners and has since been renamed. The Shiloh Museum of Ozark History has a number of items related to AQ in its collection, including menus and photos, according to Albright. The Ritter-McDonald log cabin on the grounds of the Shiloh Museum, believed to be built in 1854, was owned by several generations of the Ritter family, she said.
