        A Senate panel on Monday concurred with a House amendment to a bill intended to create a process for challenging books available to children in public and school libraries. The Committee on Judiciary in a voice vote sent Senate Bill 81 to the full Senate for further consideration. SB81, by Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Jonesboro, would create an offense for "furnishing a harmful item to a minor" and strike a defense from state law protecting librarians from criminal prosecution under obscenity laws. Sullivan told committee members the change made to the bill in the House was a "good amendment". The House sponsor of the measure, Rep. Justin Gonzales, R-Okolona, has said the amendment was intended to make clarifying changes. The amendment would also allow committees of librarians and legislative panels to require a school or public library to "relocate" challenged books within their library rather than "remove" them. Gonzales has said librarians would have to place these books in a part of the library not accessible to children. Sullivan has said the bill would not create a list of banned books and noted a librarian would have to knowingly distribute material deemed obscene by a court before they could be prosecuted. Supporters have said the bill is needed to protect children. Critics contend the legislation could lead to children having restricted access to important literature. The challenge process, opponents have said, would create a separation of powers issue by providing legislative bodies judicial power. Those against the bill expected it could lead to libraries and local elected officials being flooded by costly challenges. SB81 would require libraries to form committees to review challenges to books. Sullivan has said these committees would be subject to open meetings laws. Under the bill, people could appeal decisions made by the committees to a body of local elected officials. In the case of a school library, the body would be the school board. For a municipal or public library, appeals would go to the governing body of the county or municipality. Gonzales has said officials would have to review books in their entirety when considering challenges. A provision of SB81 would allow libraries to disclose confidential library records to the parent or legal guardian of a minor. Under the bill, a person who knowingly provides a child with an item that is "harmful to minors" would be guilty of a Class A misdemeanor. A person also could commit this offense by transmitting through direct internet communication an item that is "harmful to minors" to a person they believe to be a minor.

         BENTONVILLE -- Benton County prosecutors have filed formal charges against a son of former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson in connection with his January arrest. William Asa Hutchinson III, 47, is charged with possession of a controlled substance, driving while intoxicated second offense and refusal to submit to a chemical test. He is accused of possessing a usable amount but less than 2 grams of cocaine, a schedule II controlled substance, according to court documents. His arrest stems from a traffic stop Jan. 16. A Benton County sheriff's deputy saw a vehicle westbound on Southwest 14th Street, according to a probable cause affidavit. The car was traveling 71 mph in a 45 mph zone, according to the affidavit. The deputy stopped the vehicle on Been Road and Hutchinson was identified as the driver, according to the affidavit. The deputy described Hutchinson's eyes as bloodshot and watery and said he smelled alcohol on Hutchinson's breath. The deputy did field sobriety tests on Hutchinson and believed Hutchinson was under the influence of alcohol to such a degree his reactions, motor skills and judgment were substantially altered, the affidavit states. Hutchinson was arrested on a charge of driving while intoxicated. The deputy searched Hutchinson and found a clear plastic bag with a white, powdery substance in his right jacket pocket; the substance tested positive for cocaine, according to the affidavit. Hutchinson, who is free on $50,000 bond, is scheduled to appear in court on April 11 for his arraignment. Hutchinson's father served as Arkansas' governor from 2015 until January. The former governor has said he plans to decide next month on whether to run for president in the 2024 election.

         The planned addition of a three-story classroom building and an indoor practice field to the south side of Little Rock's historic Central High campus will not mar the grandeur of the main building, school system leaders have assured School Board members and others in recent weeks. "The architects have done a fantastic job of celebrating the design of the original academic building at Central," Kevin Yarberry, the district's director of maintenance and operations, told the School Board about the design of a classroom addition that will replace a row of portable buildings. "Now, obviously we're not using the same materials," Yarberry said about the new building. "Most of them are almost impossible to procure in today's time. But when you see the full presentation you will see a lot of nods to the [main] academic building. There are a lot of similarities." The Little Rock School Board recently authorized the expenditure of $6.6 million for site preparation at Central for the campus additions. That work will include leasing and installing new portable classrooms for temporary use while the old portables are taken away and the new science building is constructed. Existing student parking -- displaced by the new portables -- will shift temporarily to the baseball field, which will be renovated later. The School Board is expected to get a full presentation on the project design and possibly act on a recommended guaranteed maximum price for the Central projects in April. The Central additions are among several building projects in various stages of planning and building in the 21,000-student capital city school district. The projects, which include a new kindergarten-through-eighth-grade academy, a renovated early childhood center and a new traditional high school, are largely the result of a Nov. 2, 2021, voter-approved 12.4-mill property tax rate extension. At Central, classrooms and laboratories for physics and family and consumer science will be housed on the first floor of the new classroom building, as will a lecture hall and restrooms for the new, nearby baseball field. Chemistry classrooms and laboratories will have a home on the second floor, and biology space and a robotics laboratory are planned for the third floor, Yarberry told the School Board. The new building will not be attached to the main building but will be separated by an outdoor commons area -- or plaza -- where students can gather before and after school and at lunch. The new two-story indoor practice field at the south end of Quigley Stadium is to have not only a practice field but also spaces for wrestling and spirit groups, as well as locker rooms for several sports, coaches' offices, and a weight room. A second-floor ledge on the north side of the facility will be used for stadium viewing of football games and other events below. Heavy lifting on the site preparation and construction will begin in June, Yarberry said about the work that was estimated at about $45 million for the classrooms and $8.5 million for the field house and for auditorium improvements at the time of the November 2021 election. The district team has been working with Polk Stanley Wilcox Architects and Nabholz & Doyne Construction on the project. Little Rock Central High -- then known as Little Rock High School -- was completed in 1927 at a cost of $1.5 million. It was identified at the time as the nation's most beautiful high school by the National Association of Architects. The imposing five-story front of the school was the backdrop for national and international news coverage of the 1957 desegregation of the all-white high school by nine Black students. That was a feat accomplished only after then-President Dwight Eisenhower called out the U.S. Army's 101st Airborne Division to escort and protect the nine teenagers from angry white crowds outside the school. ELSEWHERE Furthest along among the district's biggest building projects is the construction of the new Dr. Marian G. Lacey Academy for kindergarten through eighth grade on Geyer Springs Road. That building is on the site of the former McClellan High. Likely starting in the second half of 2023 will be the comprehensive remodel of Rockefeller Early Childhood Center, 700 E. 17th St. That 12-to-18-month Rockefeller project calls for putting up classroom walls in what has been an open-space elementary but was recently converted to an early childhood center for infants, toddlers and pre-kindergartners. Also in the plans are a face-lift to the school's main entrance, a new vestibule, removal of some exterior doors around the building, space for child play and exploration, a community room and restrooms that meet Americans with Disabilities Act requirements. In the planning stages and previously publicized is what will be a 1,200-student traditional high school next door to Pinnacle View Middle School, 5701 Ranch Drive, in the northwest part of the city. The new school -- typically referred to as West High -- will incorporate the existing but smaller West School of Innovation. NO LONGER SCHOOLS At the same time the district is building and renovating, it is dealing with campuses that have been closed as traditional schools. David O. Dodd, Booker and Meadowcliff elementary schools, as well as the former Southwest Junior High/Hamilton Alternative Learning Center, are among the no-longer-used schools that are in transition. The district has marketed Dodd at 6423 Stagecoach Road, for example, and has received some offers for it. The Booker building, 2016 Barber St., is owned by the district but sits on city of Little Rock property. Meadowcliff, 25 Sheraton Drive, is largely boarded up. The district, by law, must give charter school operators the right of first refusal for closed or under-used school properties before putting a property up for sale to others. The former Southwest Junior High/Hamilton Alternative Learning Center, 3401 S. Bryant St., is being considered by the district for new uses, including a home to the district's student registration office.  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         MAYFLOWER -- A decade after a pipeline rupture sent thousands of gallons of crude oil oozing through the Northwoods subdivision, the Mayflower neighborhood resembles any other quiet suburb. Yards once blackened by oil are now green with grass. Homes that were evacuated shortly after the spill have cars parked in their driveways. Among the only visible reminders of the leak that upended the lives of dozens of residents are a couple of vacant plots that ring a cul-de-sac at the corner of the neighborhood closest to the pipeline. On March 29, 2013, what was then known as the Pegasus pipeline split open, releasing more than 100,000 gallons of oil containing toxic compounds including benzene, a carcinogen. The spill prompted a monthslong clean up and the evacuation of 22 homes. Some of the residents never moved back to the subdivision. After the rupture, federal officials ordered Exxon Mobil Corp. to shut down the pipeline to allow for repairs. The company has since sold the roughly 850-mile line to Energy Transfer, which has not announced plans to begin using the conduit to transport oil again. Nevertheless, concerns remain that if the aging pipeline built in the 1940s is reopened, another spill could contaminate Lake Maumelle, a drinking water reservoir for about half a million Arkansans. In the years after the spill, Exxon Mobil and its subsidiaries faced at least 17 lawsuits filed in state and federal courts. One of the highest-profile cases ended in 2015 when a U.S. district court judge signed off on a $5.07 million settlement reached between Exxon Mobil and state and federal governments. The company did not admit liability in the case. As part of its efforts to address the spill, Exxon Mobil purchased and sold at least 31 homes in the subdivision and demolished at least three, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette has reported. Meggie Hardcastle, who moved into a home near the site of the spill, said Wednesday the majority of the people living on her street were also new to the area. "I think most of the people that were living here when the oil spill [occurred] left and they never came back," she said. "Whenever I first moved here, there was one other person living on this street. Now it's full." Kassi Posey, who moved to the subdivision roughly four years ago, said she has enjoyed living in the community. "There's lots of families with little kids and retired people. It's really quiet," she said. At least one resident who was living in the subdivision at the time of the spill has remained, though he declined to give his name when speaking with a reporter. While Faulkner County Judge Allen Dodson said his heart went out to the residents who left the subdivision following the spill, he noted the community had come a long way in the last 10 years. "They've done a fabulous job of saying 'hey this happened here let's climb our way out of this and go on about our bright future'," he said during an interview Wednesday. Dodson, who was serving as county judge in 2013, was among the first to respond to the spill. Along with workers from the county, state agencies and the city of Mayflower, he helped stop the flow of the oil in a cove of Lake Conway. A federal investigative report credited the rapid response of local emergency responders and public officials with preventing the oil from reaching the main body of the popular fishing lake. Hundreds of wild animals living near the lake were still affected by the spill. At least 123 creatures were found dead and more than 230 snakes were euthanized in the field, the Democrat-Gazette reported after the spill. If any good came from the oil leak, Dodson said, containing the spill at least helped prepare first responders for a deadly tornado that tore through Mayflower a little more than a year later. "As bad as a major oil spill is, it was nothing compared to that tornado," he said. While Dodson said he had concerns about Energy Transfer reopening the pipeline, he said the oil conduits that crisscross the nation are part of modern life. "I think you always have that concern in the back of your mind," he said. "At the same time, we have pipelines everywhere." For Raven Lawson, watershed protection manager at Central Arkansas Water, the possibility of the pipeline reopening is a top concern. A 13-mile section of the conduit runs along Lake Maumelle, the primary drinking water source for the Little Rock metro area. Along this stretch, the pipeline crosses bodies of water including tributary streams and wetlands at 13 points. Several sections of the pipe near the lake are aboveground which makes them more susceptible to damage, said Lawson. While there are other threats to the water quality of the lake, Lawson said federal risk analysis has deemed an oil spill to be the primary concern for Central Arkansas Water. "These risk analyses are really in-depth. They cover everything from cybersecurity to an active shooter, chemical spills, the whole gamut across the utility," she said during an interview Thursday. "Those risk studies rank [a spill] as the number one risk to our operations." If oil begins flowing through the pipeline again, Lawson said she believed it would not be a question of "if" but "when" the conduit would rupture again. Among other attempts to safeguard the watershed from a potential spill, Central Arkansas Water made an offer in 2020 to purchase the pipeline from Energy Transfer. Tad Bohannon, the utility's chief executive, said in an emailed statement on Thursday that Energy Transfer never responded to the offer. Central Arkansas Water has established a plan to deal with an oil spill in Lake Maumelle, but Lawson noted potential responses could vary depending on the location and severity of the spill. The utility would likely draw more water from Lake Winona, though Lawson said this reservoir would not be able to meet current water demands. The utility might also have to rely on water conservation measures, including suspending sprinkler use. Central Arkansas Water could tap the Arkansas River, though Lawson said the utility would have to adopt different treatment methods to process the river water. Cleaning up the lake and restoring public confidence in Lake Maumelle's water quality after a spill could take years, she said. Max Shilstone, director of government affairs for Energy Transfer, told Central Arkansas Water in a letter dated May 23 that his company has "no plans to bring the pipeline back into service at this time." Shilstone said "current market conditions" did not warrant restarting the conduit but noted his company would "continue to maintain the pipeline in a safe, idle condition." "Should circumstances involving the pipeline and its future use change, we will communicate with interested parties, of which CAW would be included," said Shilstone in the letter. A spokesperson for Energy Transfer said in an emailed statement on Friday that the company has not announced plans to restart the pipeline. The spokesperson did not respond to a question asking if Energy Transfer has any concerns about the age and condition of the pipeline.

         ACLU of Arkansas officials recently expressed concern in a letter to Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders over four bills -- two of which have been signed into law -- that the organization says unfairly target transgender teens and adults and physicians who provide gender-affirming medical care. Senate Bill 199 -- signed into law on March 13 as Act 274 of 2023, the Protecting Minors from Medical Malpractice Act -- targets gender affirmation care for minors by allowing malpractice claims to be filed at any time up to 15 years after the minor turns 18 years old. State law sets a two-year statute of limitations on malpractice claims for other medical procedures. SB199 was introduced in the Senate by Sen. Gary Stubblefield, R-Branch, and was co-sponsored in the House by Rep. Mary Bentley, R-Perryville. House Bill 1156 -- signed by the governor on March 21 as Act 317 of 2023 -- requires students to use school restrooms, shower rooms, changing rooms and locker rooms designated for their birth gender regardless of whether those facilities correspond to their gender identity. The bill affects all public schools and open-enrollment charter schools in the state. The bill was introduced by Bentley and sponsored in the Senate by Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Jonesboro. Senate Bill 270 -- scheduled for a hearing before the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday -- would make it a crime of sexual indecency with a child for transgender adults to enter a public restroom not corresponding to their birth gender where a minor is present. The bill was introduced in the Senate by Sen. John Payton, R-Wilburn, and sponsored in the House by Rep. Cindy Crawford, R-Fort Smith. House Bill 1468 -- scheduled for a vote on the House floor Monday -- the Given Name Act, would require parental consent for an employee of any state-supported K-12 school or higher education institution to address a student under the age of 18 by their preferred name or pronoun if different from their birth certificate. The bill was introduced by Rep. Wayne Long, R-Bradford, and sponsored in the Senate by Sen. Mark Johnson, R-Little Rock. On March 9, ACLU of Arkansas sent the letter to Sanders asking her to hear concerns of Arkansans who would be most affected by the bills moving through the General Assembly before making a decision whether to sign the bills into law but said this week there was no response. "They did not ... tell us to go pound sand or anything," said Holly Dickson, executive director of ACLU of Arkansas. "We've heard nothing." A law passed two years ago banning gender-affirming care in Arkansas for anyone under the age of 18 was blocked by a federal judge in Arkansas before it could go into effect and is still tied up in federal court. Dickson said the Medical Malpractice Act appears to be an end run attempt to circumvent the court's injunction. "I think it is an attempt to take a back-door way to do what they've been told they can't do directly," Dickson said. "They've singled out providers of this care for this purpose ... It's pretty laser-focused on gender affirming care." The parents of two of the minor plaintiffs involved in the litigation currently blocking the 2021 law spoke recently to what they have gone through as the current legislative session has progressed. Joanna Brandt, a small-business owner living in Greenwood and the mother of 17-year-old Dylan Brandt, described her state of mind over the past two years as she has watched the current drama play out on the legislative stage. "It's been awful," she said. "I don't always enjoy the person I feel like I've become. It leaves me scared and angry and bitter and frustrated, sometimes all within the span of an hour." Much of her frustration, she said, has come because she believes the impact of the laws on transgender youth and their families is not being considered and the families themselves have not been consulted. "They want to talk about us but they don't want to talk to us," she said. "We're not data. We're not statistics. We're people." Her son Dylan, who begins his high school senior year in September, described his experience at school as mostly positive with supportive administrators and teachers but said the current wave of legislation is troubling. "There's a lot to think about when it comes to stuff like this," he said. "I'm weighing out my options on what to do." Lacey and Aaron Jennen, and their daughter, Sabrina, said they are also weighing their options. "It's kind of like fight or flight for me," said Lacey Jennen. "We've been fighting the best we can ... just trying to have a dialogue ... you see Arkansans like us lining up begging and pleading with them not to do this and they do it anyway." Aaron Jennen expressed frustration with lawmakers, saying a rare opportunity to address serious problems in the state is being squandered. He cited statistics ranking Arkansas 49th in the nation in health care with the highest maternal and third-highest infant mortality rates in the nation, second only to Mississippi in the teen birth rate and second-highest in hunger. "These are real problems," he said, "and when you have a budget surplus like we do, these are solvable problems, right? But instead, they take up all this time, all this energy, all this taxpayer money to legislate a fraction of a fractional portion of Arkansans out of existence. "Imagine what those rankings would be if they took all the time and effort they're spending on this issue and redirected it to those issues," he continued. According to the Arkansas House of Representatives, the state ended fiscal year 2022 with a $1.682 billion budget surplus. According to the UCLA Williams Institute, there are 13,500 transgender adults aged 18 or older in Arkansas and up to 1,800 transgender youth under 18 in the state, comprising an estimated 0.7% of the state's population of 3 million people. Attempts to contact sponsoring legislators and the governor's office regarding the current wave of anti-trans legislation were met with little success. Stubblefield, Payton and Bentley did not return messages seeking comment on the bills they introduced. Long responded in an email saying he did not wish to be interviewed. The governor's office responded with a prepared statement but did not respond to a follow-up email. "The Governor has said she will sign laws that focus on protecting and educating our kids, not indoctrinating them and believes our schools are no place for the radical left's woke agenda," said spokeswoman Alexa Henning in an email. "Arkansas isn't going to rewrite the rules of biology just to please a handful of far-left advocates." Both families said that lately, leaving Arkansas is an option never far from their minds. Every day after work, Aaron Jennen said, he checks two alerts on his home computer. One is a daily update and digest of pending legislation. The other is a list of Department of Justice job postings in other states that protect transgender rights. Sabrina, who will begin college in the fall, said she received a generous scholarship offer from Hendrix College in Conway but said the current political climate is a concern. "I wanted to stay in state because I really, really like [Arkansas]," she said, "but [Arkansas] really doesn't like me." "We love this state," Aaron echoed. "We've lived here all our lives and we don't want to leave but as parents, we have to do what is best for our children ... I'm not going to live in a place where my daughter can't go to the bathroom." "If we need to leave it's not going to be easy," said Dylan. "We'll make it work but it's definitely not going to be easy." Both families said the difficulty is because their home communities, Greenwood and Fayetteville, have been supportive of their families. But they said whether the laws being passed reflect the sentiments of their home communities or not, passage of those laws will endanger their children's health and futures regardless of where they live in Arkansas.

         The Maumelle City Council is debating what to do with a park and facility located near the Arkansas River, with one council member calling its current use a "financial travesty." The property, also known as "Park on the River" is located at 11903 Crystal Hill Road in Maumelle. Most recently, the council last week hosted a public tour from 1-2 p.m., inviting residents to view the property and share their thoughts about what to make of the area. During the hourlong tour, approximately 20 people made their way through and around the property, including three of Maumelle's council members. Park on the River offers the city's only entrance to the Arkansas River. Other public amenities at the location include the dock and an open park area. Those looking to visit the area are met with a narrow entrance just to the right, off Crystal Hill Road. Upon turning right, a single path stretches straight before a curve to the left meets a parking lot to the right and the facility to the left. Just to the left of the building is a pond surrounded by greenery. The single-path continues between the parking lot and the facility, leading visitors down toward the boat ramp and park area. According to the March 6 council meeting, the property was initially purchased by the city sometime between 2003 and 2004. Beginning in 2006, the city approved a contract with Team Summit LLC/Timmons Arts Foundation. The approved contract established a shared revenue contract between the city and Summit/Timmons. Council Member Steve Mosley said it is not clear how long the contract remained in place after 2006, but that it was renewed in 2015. The approved 2015 contract allotted Summit/Timmons another five years to continue leasing the facility on the property for weddings and events. Under the agreed contract, Summit and Timmons agreed to pay the city $1,000 a month and 25% of the net revenue -- which includes all expenses incurred, including the rent, "of all venue rental sold by Timmons at the property." The contract was signed and approved to expire in November of 2020, allowing the city to renew it or to decide how to use the property going forward. According to Mosley, the council was not aware the contract had expired in 2020 until recently when they were doing their budget process. In the March 6 council meeting, Gloria Timmons, of Summit/Timmons, told the council she would like to renew the contract for another two years, under the same rate. "I don't ask for much, but I'm asking for this," Timmons said. "I don't know what's going to happen in two years. I'd like us to go from there and open this discussion again later. If you remember, I asked to buy [the property] back then, but the council said no because it's a park. Realistically, I would love to own it, but I don't think you should sell it. Keep in mind, I've invested about $30,000 in renovations." Council Member Christine Gronwald also shared her thoughts on the property in the March meeting. "I see it as a partnership and it should be something that attracts people to Maumelle," Gronwald said. "I think it's a grossly under-used property ... the council and city should do more to promote it. With this partnership, we could better support Team Summit." Following questions from Mosley, Timmons said in a "good year" renting the facility out, they hosted an estimated 20 events. Timmons added that in the approximately 20 events, many of them were non-paid events hosted by city staff or organizations. Council Member Jess Holt opposed the idea of renewing the contract and toured the property Wednesday. "Forgive my hostility with this, but we have not accomplished anything with this," Holt said. "To me, this is a financial travesty. Let's not leap until we do a careful study as to what the potential is for this piece of property." Mayor Caleb Norris reiterated that the conversation seems to be if not a partnership with Timmons, then what. He added that the options range from renewing it or doing something completely different with the facility and land. Maumelle's Director of Community and Economic Development Courtney Dunn also took to the podium in the meeting to share her ideas for what the space could be used for. Dunn said the council could consider using the space for a visitor center, a Maumelle merchandise shop, Maumelle history, other park amenities and more. She also said the council should keep in mind that the park is located along the upcoming Greenways Trail and that they should plan to utilize that traffic and use the existing space effectively with that in mind. Developers and current Park on the River staff have said the facility in its current state can only support certain ideas or projects. Mosley suggested that the area be used for a restaurant off of the river, but was later informed that the septic capacity could not handle that currently. At this time, no decision has been made related to the contract renewal or further development of the area. Council Member R.J. Mazzoni said he's not as opposed as Holt, but does have concerns with renewing a contract immediately. "I think it's time to question if this is the best use," Mazzoni said. "We should look and see what options are out there."  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         The reward for information leading to the safe return of a missing Conway teen has been increased to $25,000, community organizers said Sunday. "When a child is missing, there is no such thing as somebody else's child," Conway resident and local organizer Jenny Wallace said. "[She] belongs to all of us, and it's going to take all of us to bring her home. Someone knows where she is, and we desperately need them to come forward. We are hopeful the reward will motivate someone to provide important information." The reward increase was announced at a birthday celebration Sunday for Tanvi Marupally, who was last seen Jan. 17 heading north on Davis Street in Conway. The reward was increased most recently from $5,000. As searches continue, members of the community gathered Sunday to plant an AU-Rosa plum tree in the Faulkner County Library community garden to celebrate Marupally turning 15 on Friday. "I'm so thankful this community has rallied around Tanvi," Wallace said. "Tanvi loves the outdoors, and she loves nature, and we don't want her birthday to go by without taking the opportunity enjoy the things that [she] would enjoy." About 100 people crowded the celebration as many filled the seats and lined the walls of a room in the library just after 2 p.m. Sunday. Residents shared hugs, tissues and words of encouragement as they celebrated the teen's birthday. Conway's Purple Cow restaurant also provided a freezer full of milkshakes to hand out during the tree planting portion of the celebration after finding out Marupally had asked for two milkshakes just before her birthday. The leading private investigator on the case, Kandis Studdard, also shared during the celebration a letter from Marupally's mother. The first line of the letter read: "Dear Conway family, we would like to sincerely thank everyone who has stood with us during this difficult time." Her letter then went on to thank a list of people and businesses for their ongoing help and support in searching for her daughter. After the letter, organizers shared a clip of Marupally presenting an "about me" assignment for class in which she spoke about what is most important to her. In the video -- which was taken Jan. 17, the last day Marupally was seen -- she highlighted her love for her family, reading, traveling and learning. Wallace encouraged community members to use Marupally's words and empathy to continue to help efforts to bring her home. "She desperately needs us," Wallace said. "Emailing the leaders of our cities, the leaders of our state, making this go national -- whatever we can do -- that's what's worth spending your time on. This child is worth spending every bit of effort and every bit of energy that we can stand. Being here today means the world to her friends, and it means the world to her family, and it's such a testament to this community." Marupally was last seen wearing a purple coat, pink pullover, blue shirt and blue jeans. She has short black hair and brown eyes. Marupally is 5 feet 5 inches tall and weighs about 115 pounds. Those with information regarding her whereabouts are encouraged to call 911 or the Conway Police Department tip line at (501) 450-6135.  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         Ball fields or pickleball courts? Chad Wolf, director of Springdale's Parks and Recreation Department, can't say which the city needs more. The city's proposed bond program would give residents an estimated $16.3 million to spend on nine parks. Residents will vote May 9 on about $360 million in bonds to allow Springdale to undertake a new round of capital improvements. Early voting starts May 2 and includes annual school elections. A large part of the program, $185 million, would pay back bonds issued in 2018 and 2020. Springdale won't be building new parks this time around; rather staff members are proposing improvements to the city's existing parks. A big part of the money earned from the sale of bonds would be used to convert ball fields from grass to turf, Wolf said. The city would install infield turf on 13 fields at the Randal Tyson Recreational Complex and J.B. Hunt Park. Adding turf would cost about $200,000 each for baseball and softball fields, and $1 million for the one soccer field the city would convert. "We would have a championship caliber soccer field," noted Colby Fulfer, the mayor's chief of staff. Springdale alsohopes to build four turf ball fields at Shaw Family Park in the far northwest part of town. The fields at the C.L. "Charlie" and Willie George Park -- in the far southeast part of town -- were laid with turf when the park was built in 2015. The spring leagues organized by the city's Parks and Recreation Department this year include a total of 231 teams of baseball, softball and soccer, with 2,808 registered players, reported Tanner Spangler, recreation superintendent for the Parks Department. And pickleball enthusiasts are clamoring for more courts. Mike LeMaster, who lives in Fayetteville, but plays in Springdale, addressed the City Council on March 14, asking for more courts. The city has converted one indoor basketball court at its Recreation Center to three pickleball courts. These remain full from about 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. with 50 to 100 people playing each day, Wolf said. Mayor Doug Sprouse said the city plans outdoor pickleball courts at Murphy Park, the Tyson complex and other parks -- if it makes sense, and if the demand is still there. "I think a facility of indoor courts might be a good investment for someone in the private sector," he added. Sprouse cautioned the projects listed are only possible plans. The city council would vote on each project and expenditures if the bond passes. TURF TIME April showers don't bring ballgames. League games and even tournaments can be canceled when it rains, Wolf said. Tournaments are a big generator of revenue for the city, Fulfer said, and if tournaments are canceled or postponed, it can cost the city money. Springdale city parks host a total of about 14 baseball, softball and soccer tournaments each year, Spangler said. The city hosts about 2,000 teams and 2,100 players -- and their families -- throughout the year. LeMaster noted he and his friends also spend money in Springdale when they come to play pickleball. Families in town for tournaments eat at restaurants, shop, buy gasoline and stay in hotels. Their purchases bring revenue to the city in the form of sales and restaurant taxes. The money they spend in the city helps pays for the city's park infrastructure, Fulfer said. "Never mind about improving the fields for tournaments, we should first look to what those fields will do for residents," said Bill Rogers, president of the Springdale Chamber of Commerce. The number of youth participating in some sort of sports has doubled from a few years ago when the city couldn't get enough players in some age groups to field more than one team, he said. "To upgrade the baseball, softball and soccer fields will be enormous to players at all levels," Rogers said. Wolf explained that the 16 grass ball fields the city maintains don't drain as efficiently as turf. It might take a grass field half a day in the sun to dry. But turf fields are designed with drainage and can be playable in an hour, he said. "Our parks are heavily used. And they provide healthy activities for children. It's so hard to get the kids outside and active when they're stuck to their screens," Sprouse said, calling on his own experience as a grandfather. The bond money also would complete a conversion to all LED lighting at all the parks and add parking at the busiest, he said. FINAL FACELIFT City leaders also hope bond money would complete renovations at the city's Recreation Center, including improvements to the concession stand, locker rooms and classrooms, Wolf said. The city bought the center in 2018 for $4 million. "Our amazing rec center was purchased with a portion of our 2018 bond issue," Sprouse said Tuesday in his annual "state of the city" speech. "What a bargain that facility has been for the people of our city. "When all renovations are complete, and including the purchase price, we'll have a total investment of less than $10 million for a building and parking that would easily cost $30 million to build today, and that doesn't include land costs." Council members unanimously approved the purchase knowing the building needed repair. Council member Mike Overton expressed "buyer's remorse" when the council toured the center for the first time in January 2019. He said Wednesday he no longer feels that way; the improvements have sold him. "Look at how much it's been used," Overton said. CLEANUP HITTERS The young players on the city's baseball, softball and soccer teams might not care whether they play on turf or in the mud, but their parents do. "They have cleats," said Anne Capdeville of Springdale. "But I don't want them getting in my car." Capdeville watched her son Noah, 12, during his first baseball practice of the spring league March 13 at the Tyson complex. At an adjacent field, Layne Keen said she despairs trying to keep her son's white baseball pants clean. Capdeville said postponed games make it harder as she is a single mother with three kids playing sports at different times and different locations. She said two or three games in a typical 10-game season are canceled. Wolf said parents are told before the season that games will be rescheduled for Friday night or Wednesday night, as needed. The schedule puts the league games and championships ending before Memorial Day, so families can get on with their summer plans, he said. Andrew Proffitt of Springdale liked the prospect of the fields at Hunt Park being turfed. His daughter Isabelle, 9, plays there on a 10 and younger team. He stood in a first-base dugout at George park watching T-ball practice for his son, Adam, 6. "It's a small park, an older park, and they have more canceled games," Proffitt said of Hunt. The park includes six fields and 160 acres for other activities, Wolf said.  Print Headline: Parks part of Springdale bond vote Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         Saturday's 13th Run Bentonville Half Marathon could set a record for participants, an official said. More than 2,800 runners have signed up, said Josh Stacey, Bentonville's Parks and Recreation services manager. Online registration runs through Tuesday, and runners can sign up in person at the race expo Friday, he said. Stacey expects 3,000 to 3,200 competitors. The largest turnout was 3,100 runners in 2019; last year drew 2,350, he said. Festivities start at 7 a.m. Saturday. The 13.1-mile run will begin and end on the downtown square. There also will be a 5-kilometer race. Runners from 36 states and South Africa have registered, Stacey said. All 50 states have been represented at least once in the half marathon's history, he said. The 2020 half marathon was virtual because of covid-19, and the 2021 race was postponed from the spring to the fall, also because of covid-19. Last year's race was in April. Racing numbers are starting to pick up, Stacey said. The city's Irish Run, a 5k race on March 11, had 1,500 participants. The race had never drawn more than 1,000 runners since it started in 2013, Stacey said. "It's getting back to where we were in 2019," Stacey said of half-marathon participation. "We like the spring date. It has been successful for us." The Parks and Recreation Department relies on revenue generated from the race to help create and maintain new and existing parks and programs, departmental administrative costs, and other park amenities within the city. The race also helps provide funding for programs like the city's July Fourth fireworks show and other community events, according to the race website. Last year's race grossed $165,000, with $25,000 in profit, Stacey said. About 300 volunteers will help Saturday. Aid-and-water stations will be 1.8-2.3 miles apart. The stations are equipped with water and Gatorade, according to the event website. What makes the Bentonville Half Marathon unique is it's the marquee event, Stacey said. Many half marathons held across the country are tied to full marathons that happen the same day, he said. The amount of promotional items, or swag, given at the event also is a draw; swag bags contain about 40 items, he said. Lindsay Bailey of Cave Springs will run her third Bentonville Half Marathon on Saturday. She ran in the inaugural event and again last year. In between those races, her running went on hiatus; she got married in 2012 and had three children. Her goal is to achieve a personal best time, but she knows what comes near the end of the half marathon. Her husband and children met her at the finish line last year. "It was cool for the kids to see the whole environment," she said. The community has embraced the event from its beginning in 2011, Stacey said. People come to the square to see the runners finish. They also watch from their front yards along the race course, and others have half-marathon get-togethers, he said. The event also is a chance to sell Bentonville to out-of-town runners, he said. Big events like the Bentonville Half Marathon attract a lot of foot traffic, providing an excellent opportunity for local merchants and restaurants to generate additional revenue, said Dana Sargent Schlagenhaft, Downtown Bentonville Inc. executive director. "The impact of these gatherings extends beyond the actual event day, as visitors get to explore the area and could be influenced to make future purchases," she said. "Additionally, big events help maintain an active, vibrant city center and serve as the ideal way to enjoy a spring morning in our beautiful downtown."

         DeGray Lake Resort State Park is seeking volunteers to sign up for its annual spring Shoreline Sweep Cleanup on April 1. The cleanup, which is scheduled from 9 a.m. to noon, will cover 14 miles of shoreline. The volunteers will be divided up into groups and assigned different sections of shoreline around the park to maximize efficiency. After the cleanup, volunteers will be provided with a free lunch and a chance to win one of several door prizes. Gloves, trash bags and safety vests will be provided to volunteers on site, organizers said. In order to ensure sufficient supplies for everyone, the state park would like volunteers to register for the cleanup by calling (501) 865-5801. Volunteers should dress appropriately for the weather, bring water to stay hydrated and wear sturdy hiking or tennis shoes for walking on the rocky shoreline, organizers said. On the morning of the cleanup, volunteers should meet at Pavilion 2 in the Caddo Bend Day Use Area to pick up their supplies and receive their cleanup area assignments, officials said. The event is being held in coordination with the Keep Arkansas Beautiful initiative. DeGray Lake Resort State Park is located on the shores of DeGray Lake, near Hot Springs and Arkadelphia.

            <h2>Northwest Arkansas regional planners believe technology can make driving easier, safer in region</h2>

         Anyone who has driven in Northwest Arkansas for any length of time has been there: You're driving along at the speed of normal traffic, brake lights ahead begin to flicker then stay on and the next thing you know -- if you were able to stop in time -- you're sitting in a three-lane parking lot with several hundred of your friends and neighbors, hoping to crawl to the next exit so you can try to find an alternate route. It might be caused by an accident, bad weather, a ball game or other event or just too many cars for the amount of road available that time of day. Regional planners want to work with cities, counties and the state to make driving easier, safer and more efficient, even as the population continues to grow at one of the fastest rates in the nation. They're working right now on drafts of two plans, compiled by Cambridge Systematics, aimed at making that happen over the next five, 10 and 20 years. Transportation systems management and operations are strategies focused on operational improvements to maintain or restore the performance of the existing transportation system before extra capacity is needed. The strategies are often low-cost relative to adding capacity to existing roads. They frequently are high-impact measures that can be implemented more quickly than a traditional road building project. Intelligent transportation systems are the application of electronic technologies and communications to increase the safety and efficiency of roads. The approach allows officials to plan for what they want their system to look like in the long-term and then break the system into smaller pieces that can be implemented over time as funding permits. "Transportation systems management and operations is a focus on how you're managing your roadway system on a day-to-day basis," said Tim Conklin, executive director at the Northwest Arkansas Regional Planning Commission. "The intelligent transportation system is more about the technology and the types of technology communities use. We use technology to manage the system, and there's some obvious overlap in there." Together, the two initiatives touch on just about everything from traffic light technology to public transit and economics to demographics. Regional planning last updated its intelligent transportation plan in 2007. "A lot has changed. Obviously, the technology has changed, the region has changed," Conklin said. "When it takes an hour to go from Springdale to Centerton, we do have traffic congestion in Northwest Arkansas beyond what some people may think." Compared to other areas, Northwest Arkansas is playing catch-up on using technology such as traffic cameras, traffic signal timing and coordination and traveler information systems. "We did this capability study to see where we're at, and I'd say it's no surprise that we're in the beginning stages," Conklin said. "We're not very advanced in our region with regard to using a system management approach, but as we approach a million population, you're going to need to do more and more." The Fayetteville-Springdale-Rogers metro area population was 546,725 in the 2020 census. Conklin said a regional approach is critical because Northwest Arkansas is composed of multiple smaller cities. "Bigger cities and even smaller urban areas than us have real time traveler information on their interstate and freeway systems," Conklin said. "We don't have one big central city; it requires everybody to work together and try to identify some things we can work on." Chris Brown, public works director for Fayetteville, said the plans will set the stage for a regional approach to traffic management. "Especially as technology continues to advance and connected vehicles become more prevalent, it will be important to understand how the various cities' traffic signals can communicate with each other to create a seamless experience for drivers," Brown said. "As the cities continue to invest in the newest technology, standardizing as much as possible throughout the region will be beneficial for all." The future planners envision is not that far away, Conklin said. "With the advances in technology, I think it's sooner than later," he said. ON THE HORIZON Systems management planning will be focused on the roads connecting cities in the region rather than on the internal network in the cities themselves, according to the plans. One option would be coordinating with cities in the region and the Arkansas Department of Transportation to establish a regional transportation management center that would manage traffic using real-time traffic data from cameras, speed sensors and other equipment. The information is collected and then analyzed to make modifications using automated systems, such as connected traffic lights and message boards. Special software allows an operator in the center to communicate directly with field equipment and modify traffic signal programs in real time, for example. Another option could be having coordinated traffic management systems on all the major roads in the region. Coordinated signal timing, for example, synchronizes traffic movements and manages speed for uninterrupted traffic flow along a corridor. It can also be used to vary speed limits under certain conditions, allow emergency vehicles to preempt traffic signals at intersections or allow transit buses to extend a green light so they can get through an intersection. Currently, each of the cities is responsible for maintaining and operating the traffic signals within its jurisdiction. The methods for signal operation and the level of technology used vary widely. Traffic signals in the region generally have equipment for vehicle detection, video capture, signal controllers and communications. All of the bigger cities have the capability to monitor video feeds and signal operations remotely from city offices, according to the draft plans. Several cities have centers for monitoring their signal systems and taking corrective actions when necessary. Springdale evaluated adaptive signal timing, using traffic sensors to modify signal timing in response to demand, at eight traffic signals along a 3-mile section of Thompson Street in 2010, and it's still using it. The city is also looking into other artificial intelligence applications. Most of the larger cities have the capability for signal preemption for emergency vehicles. Some have systems that could provide preemption for transit vehicles, but none is using that capability now. Given the right technology, lanes could be reversed to switch the direction of traffic flow during certain times and conditions to use existing infrastructure more efficiently. Ramp meters, controllable traffic lights that regulate the flow of traffic entering freeways based on current traffic conditions, could be used to slow the flow of vehicles from on-ramps onto a highway during peak periods of congestion. A NATIONAL FOCUS The federal government also is pushing investments in technology and data to improve transportation systems across the country. The U.S. Department of Transportation on Tuesday announced the first round of grants totaling over $94 million for 59 projects across the country through the new Strengthening Mobility and Revolutionizing Transportation grants program. "Every major advancement in the history of U.S. transportation has involved technological progress," said U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. "The investments we are making today are about fostering innovations that improve people's day-to-day lives, making transportation safer, more reliable, more efficient and more sustainable." The competitive grant program provides state, local and tribal governments $500 million over five years to leverage technology to create safer and more equitable, efficient and innovative transportation systems. The first year of the program was oversubscribed, meaning that for every $1 available for grants, $6 worth of project funding was sought. The maximum award per project was $2 million for that round of funding. Communities are urged to use the grants to target real-world challenges where the use of new technologies and approaches can create benefits. No projects in Arkansas were awarded money this time around. The next funding opportunity of $100 million is expected to be released in the fall. Regional planners said they did not apply for money in the first round because their new plans were not mature enough when the the call for projects went out. They're hoping to apply after the plans are approved by the regional planning commission board. "We are looking into that," Conklin said. "Ideally, we'll find planning partners that are also interested." []  Print Headline: Regional approach set for traffic control Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        Woman arrested in NLR stabbing North Little Rock police found one person stabbed and arrested another Sunday after an early morning standoff. Trice Dawkins, 48, of North Little Rock was arrested "without incident" after an hourslong standoff with police that started about 3 a.m. Sunday, according to a news release. Before the standoff, police responded to a residence on the 700 block of West 16th Street and found a victim who had been stabbed, according to the release. The victim was taken to a local hospital and remained in stable condition Sunday, the release said. Officers then learned Dawkins was barricaded inside the residence. She has been charged with first-degree domestic battery, the release said, and is being held in the Pulaski County jail without bond. An investigation is ongoing.

         CONWAY -- The reward for information leading to the safe return of a missing Conway teen has been increased to $25,000, community organizers said Sunday. "When a child is missing, there is no such thing as somebody else's child," Conway resident and local organizer Jenny Wallace said. "[She] belongs to all of us, and it's going to take all of us to bring her home. Someone knows where she is, and we desperately need them to come forward. We are hopeful the reward will motivate someone to provide important information." The reward increase was announced at a birthday celebration Sunday for Tanvi Marupally, who was last seen Jan. 17 heading north on Davis Street in Conway. The reward was increased most recently from $5,000. As searches continue, members of the community gathered Sunday to plant an AU-Rosa plum tree in the Faulkner County Library community garden to celebrate Marupally turning 15 on Friday. "I'm so thankful this community has rallied around Tanvi," Wallace said. "Tanvi loves the outdoors, and she loves nature, and we don't want her birthday to go by without taking the opportunity enjoy the things that [she] would enjoy." About 100 people crowded the celebration as many filled the seats and lined the walls of a room in the library just after 2 p.m. Sunday. Residents shared hugs, tissues and words of encouragement as they celebrated the teen's birthday. Conway's Purple Cow restaurant also provided a freezer full of milkshakes to hand out during the tree planting portion of the celebration after finding out Marupally had asked for two milkshakes just before her birthday. The leading private investigator on the case, Kandis Studdard, also shared during the celebration a letter from Marupally's mother. The first line of the letter read: "Dear Conway family, we would like to sincerely thank everyone who has stood with us during this difficult time." Her letter then went on to thank a list of people and businesses for their ongoing help and support in searching for her daughter. After the letter, organizers shared a clip of Marupally presenting an "about me" assignment for class in which she spoke about what is most important to her. In the video -- which was taken Jan. 17, the last day Marupally was seen -- she highlighted her love for her family, reading, traveling and learning. Wallace encouraged community members to use Marupally's words and empathy to continue to help efforts to bring her home. "She desperately needs us," Wallace said. "Emailing the leaders of our cities, the leaders of our state, making this go national -- whatever we can do -- that's what's worth spending your time on. This child is worth spending every bit of effort and every bit of energy that we can stand. Being here today means the world to her friends, and it means the world to her family, and it's such a testament to this community." Marupally was last seen wearing a purple coat, pink pullover, blue shirt and blue jeans. She has short black hair and brown eyes. Marupally is 5 feet 5 inches tall and weighs about 115 pounds. Those with information regarding her whereabouts are encouraged to call 911 or the Conway Police Department tip line at (501) 450-6135.

         BENTONVILLE -- Saturday's 13th Run Bentonville Half Marathon could set a record for participants, an official said. More than 2,800 runners have signed up, said Josh Stacey, Parks and Recreation services manager. Online registration runs through Tuesday, and runners can sign up in person at the race expo Friday, he said. Stacey expects 3,000 to 3,200 competitors. The largest turnout was 3,100 runners in 2019; last year drew 2,350, Stacey said. Festivities start at 7 a.m. The 13.1-mile run will begin and end on the downtown square. There also will be a 5-kilometer race. Runners from 36 states and South Africa have registered, he said. All 50 states have been represented at least once in the half marathon's history, he said. The 2020 half marathon was virtual because of covid-19, and the 2021 race was postponed from the spring to the fall, also because of covid-19. Last year's race was in April. Racing numbers are starting to pick up, Stacey said. The city's Irish Run, a 5k race on March 11, had 1,500 participants. The race had never drawn more than 1,000 runners since it started in 2013, Stacey said. "It's getting back to where we were in 2019," Stacey said of half marathon participation. "We like the spring date. It has been successful for us." The Parks and Recreation Department relies on the revenue generated from the race for the creation and maintenance of new and/or existing parks and programs, departmental administrative costs and other park amenities within the city. The race helps provide programs like the Fourth of July fireworks show and other community events, according to the race website. Last year's race grossed $165,000 and $25,000 in profit, Stacey said. About 300 volunteers will help Saturday. Aid/water stations will be 1.8 to 2.3 miles apart. Stations are equipped with water and Gatorade, according to the event website. What makes the Run Bentonville Half Marathon unique is it's the marquee event, Stacey said. Many half marathons held across the country are tied to full marathons that happen the same day, he said. The amount of swag given at the event also is a draw; swag bags contain about 40 items, he said. Lindsay Bailey of Cave Springs will run her third Bentonville Half Marathon on Saturday. She ran in the inaugural one and again last year. In between those races, her running went on hiatus; she got married in 2012 and had three children. Her goal is to achieve a personal best time. Her husband and children met her at the finish line last year. "It was cool for the kids to see the whole environment," she said. The community has embraced the event from its beginning in 2011, Stacey said. People come to the square to see the runners finish. They also watch from their front yards along the race course and others have half marathon get-togethers, he said. The event also is a chance to sell Bentonville to out-of-town runners, he said. Big events like the Run Bentonville Half Marathon attract a lot of foot traffic, providing an excellent opportunity for local merchants and restaurants to generate additional revenue, said Dana Sargent Schlagenhaft, Downtown Bentonville Inc. executive director. "The impact of these gatherings extends beyond the actual event day, as visitors get to explore the area and could be influenced to make future purchases," she said. "Additionally, big events help maintain an active, vibrant city center and serve as the ideal way to enjoy a spring morning in our beautiful downtown."  None  Race expo The Run Bentonville Half Marathon Health and Wellness Expo will be from 10 a.m.-7 p.m. Friday at Record, 104 S.W. A St. The expo is where runners will pick up their race-day packets, including a timing chip, race bib, shirt and swag bag. The expo also will feature over 20 health and wellness vendors.

         BELLA VISTA -- It takes approximately three hours to drive from Kansas City, Mo., to Blowing Springs Park in Bella Vista. For one group, the drive from their hometown to this vacation campground seems to be worth every minute. The group -- Kenny, Kristen and Brooklynn Anderson and their dog, Cruz, and friends Will and Esther Mengarelli and Logan Arnold -- took a break from packing up before heading back home on a recent afternoon to talk about the last few days they had spent at Blowing Springs, the most recent of several trips they've made to Northwest Arkansas to spend time enjoying the many recreational and fun activities this part of the state has to offer. As they relaxed in chairs and sat at the picnic table located between two of the park's new Tiny Cabins they had rented for this trip, Kenny Anderson recalled his family's first camping trip to the park. "We had booked the original pod [tiny cabin across the road from the new ones] back in 2019 when we came down for the first time," he said. "The first time we came here it was just the three of us," he added, referring to his wife and daughter. It was nice, especially with a little one. She was under 5 at the time so she would sleep on the floor on a little pallet. We really enjoyed it." The Andersons have also stayed in a camper on the park's RV side. It was during one of their previous trips when they saw that ground was being broken for the new tiny cabins. During this latest trip the Mengarellis also stayed in a tiny cabin while Arnold "roughed it" by sleeping in a tent he pitched nearby. Those staying in the tiny cabins enjoyed having access to microwaves and refrigerators, among other things. "We were amazed by how clean and comfy they were and the nice furnishings," said Esther Mengarelli. "They were heated perfectly. We also stayed in one in the summer, and the air conditioning is good. They're very comfortable." The tiny cabins and park setting seem to add to the enjoyment the group derives from time spent in Northwest Arkansas. "I'd say what we love about it the most is easy access to all the trails," Kristen Anderson said. "For those that don't bike, you can hike the trails and walk the trails, and it's dog-friendly and people-friendly. It's also very safe. The kids can play in the creek, and we can go into town if we need to and grab something real quick from Allen's grocery story if we need to or go into Bentonville and enjoy Ozark Mountain Bagels like we did this morning. "We love this area," she said. Even though rain fell during part of their trip, the campers still found fun ways to spend their time. "We did have a rainy day, so we went into town and shopped around and went to some of the local restaurants," said Kristen Anderson. "We'll find things to do when we're here like going to the Amazeum and Crystal Bridges," added her husband. While the group enjoys taking advantage of the many recreational opportunities this area has to offer, some of the most fun is spent just being together as a family. "I like it because you can have some time to spend with your family," said young Brooklyn Anderson, who added that her dog, Cruz, also likes the tiny cabins. Kenny Anderson said the group visits Northwest Arkansas "seven to eight times a year" but added that not all of the visits are camping trips. "We may stay three or four times a year," he said. "We've camped and stayed in Airbnbs. Sometimes we just come down for a day trip." The miles don't seem to matter when there's fun and family time at the destination.

         MAUMELLE -- The Maumelle City Council is debating what to do with a park and facility located near the Arkansas River, with one council member calling its current use a "financial travesty." The property, also known as "Park on the River" is located at 11903 Crystal Hill Road in Maumelle. Most recently, the council last week hosted a public tour from 1-2 p.m., inviting residents to view the property and share their thoughts about what to make of the area. During the hourlong tour, approximately 20 people made their way through and around the property, including three of Maumelle's council members. Park on the River offers the city's only entrance to the Arkansas River. Other public amenities at the location include the dock and an open park area. Those looking to visit the area are met with a narrow entrance just to the right, off Crystal Hill Road. Upon turning right, a single path stretches straight before a curve to the left meets a parking lot to the right and the facility to the left. Just to the left of the building is a pond surrounded by greenery. The single-path continues between the parking lot and the facility, leading visitors down toward the boat ramp and park area. According to the March 6 council meeting, the property was initially purchased by the city sometime between 2003 and 2004. Beginning in 2006, the city approved a contract with Team Summit LLC/Timmons Arts Foundation. The approved contract established a shared revenue contract between the city and Summit/Timmons. Council member Steve Mosley said it is not clear how long the contract remained in place after 2006 but that it was renewed in 2015. The approved 2015 contract allotted Summit/Timmons another five years to continue leasing the facility on the property for weddings and events. Under the agreed contract, Summit and Timmons agreed to pay the city $1,000 a month and 25% of the net revenue -- which includes all expenses incurred, including the rent, "of all venue rental sold by Timmons at the property." The contract was signed and approved to expire in November of 2020, allowing the city to renew it or to decide how to use the property going forward. According to Mosley, the council was not aware the contract had expired in 2020 until recently when they were doing their budget process. In the March 6 council meeting, Gloria Timmons, of Summit/Timmons, told the council she would like to renew the contract for another two years, under the same rate. "I don't ask for much, but I'm asking for this," Timmons said. "I don't know what's going to happen in two years. I'd like us to go from there and open this discussion again later. If you remember, I asked to buy [the property] back then, but the council said no because it's a park. Realistically, I would love to own it, but I don't think you should sell it. Keep in mind, I've invested about $30,000 in renovations." Council member Christine Gronwald also shared her thoughts on the property in the March meeting. "I see it as a partnership, and it should be something that attracts people to Maumelle," Gronwald said. "I think it's a grossly under-used property ... the council and city should do more to promote it. With this partnership, we could better support Team Summit." Following questions from Mosley, Timmons said in a "good year" renting the facility out, they hosted an estimated 20 events. Timmons added that in the approximately 20 events, many of them were non-paid events hosted by city staff or organizations. Council member Jess Holt opposed the idea of renewing the contract and toured the property Wednesday. "Forgive my hostility with this, but we have not accomplished anything with this," Holt said. "To me, this is a financial travesty. Let's not leap until we do a careful study as to what the potential is for this piece of property." Mayor Caleb Norris reiterated that the conversation seems to be if not a partnership with Timmons, then what. He added that the options range from renewing it or doing something completely different with the facility and land. Maumelle's Director of Community and Economic Development Courtney Dunn also took to the podium in the meeting to share her ideas for what the space could be used for. Dunn said the council could consider using the space for a visitor center, a Maumelle merchandise shop, Maumelle history, other park amenities and more. She also said the council should keep in mind that the park is located along the upcoming Greenways Trail and that they should plan to utilize that traffic and use the existing space effectively with that in mind. Developers and current Park on the River staff have said the facility in its current state can only support certain ideas or projects. Mosley suggested that the area be used for a restaurant off the river but was later informed that the septic capacity could not handle that currently. At this time, no decision has been made related to the contract renewal or further development of the area. Council member R.J. Mazzoni said he's not as opposed as Holt, but he does have concerns with renewing a contract immediately. "I think it's time to question if this is the best use," Mazzoni said. "We should look and see what options are out there."  Print Headline: Park on the River sparks debate Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

            <h2>ACLU of Arkansas voices concerns over transgender laws passed by legislators in letter to Gov. Sarah Sanders</h2>

         ACLU of Arkansas officials recently expressed concern in a letter to Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders over four bills -- two of which have been signed into law -- that the organization says unfairly target transgender teens and adults and physicians who provide gender-affirming medical care. Senate Bill 199 -- signed into law on March 13 as Act 274 of 2023, the Protecting Minors from Medical Malpractice Act -- targets gender affirmation care for minors by allowing malpractice claims to be filed at any time up to 15 years after the minor turns 18 years old. State law sets a two-year statute of limitations on malpractice claims for other medical procedures. SB199 was introduced in the Senate by Sen. Gary Stubblefield, R-Branch, and was co-sponsored in the House by Rep. Mary Bentley, R-Perryville. House Bill 1156 -- signed by the governor on March 21 as Act 317 of 2023 -- requires students to use school restrooms, shower rooms, changing rooms and locker rooms designated for their birth gender regardless of whether those facilities correspond to their gender identity. The bill affects all public schools and open-enrollment charter schools in the state. The bill was introduced by Bentley and sponsored in the Senate by Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Jonesboro. Senate Bill 270 -- scheduled for a hearing before the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday -- would make it a crime of sexual indecency with a child for transgender adults to enter a public restroom not corresponding to their birth gender where a minor is present. The bill was introduced in the Senate by Sen. John Payton, R-Wilburn, and sponsored in the House by Rep. Cindy Crawford, R-Fort Smith. House Bill 1468 -- scheduled for a vote on the House floor Monday -- the Given Name Act, would require parental consent for an employee of any state-supported K-12 school or higher education institution to address a student under the age of 18 by their preferred name or pronoun if different from their birth certificate. The bill was introduced by Rep. Wayne Long, R-Bradford, and sponsored in the Senate by Sen. Mark Johnson, R-Little Rock. On March 9, ACLU of Arkansas sent the letter to Sanders asking her to hear concerns of Arkansans who would be most affected by the bills moving through the General Assembly before making a decision whether to sign the bills into law but said this week there was no response. "They did not ... tell us to go pound sand or anything," said Holly Dickson, executive director of ACLU of Arkansas. "We've heard nothing." A law passed two years ago banning gender-affirming care in Arkansas for anyone under the age of 18 was blocked by a federal judge in Arkansas before it could go into effect and is still tied up in federal court. Dickson said the Medical Malpractice Act appears to be an end run attempt to circumvent the court's injunction. "I think it is an attempt to take a back-door way to do what they've been told they can't do directly," Dickson said. "They've singled out providers of this care for this purpose ... It's pretty laser-focused on gender affirming care." The parents of two of the minor plaintiffs involved in the litigation currently blocking the 2021 law spoke recently to what they have gone through as the current legislative session has progressed. Joanna Brandt, a small-business owner living in Greenwood and the mother of 17-year-old Dylan Brandt, described her state of mind over the past two years as she has watched the current drama play out on the legislative stage. "It's been awful," she said. "I don't always enjoy the person I feel like I've become. It leaves me scared and angry and bitter and frustrated, sometimes all within the span of an hour." Much of her frustration, she said, has come because she believes the impact of the laws on transgender youth and their families is not being considered and the families themselves have not been consulted. "They want to talk about us, but they don't want to talk to us," she said. "We're not data. We're not statistics. We're people." Her son Dylan, who begins his high school senior year in September, described his experience at school as mostly positive with supportive administrators and teachers but said the current wave of legislation is troubling. "There's a lot to think about when it comes to stuff like this," he said. "I'm weighing out my options on what to do." Lacey and Aaron Jennen, and their daughter, Sabrina, said they are also weighing their options. "It's kind of like fight or flight for me," said Lacey Jennen. "We've been fighting the best we can ... just trying to have a dialogue ... you see Arkansans like us lining up begging and pleading with them not to do this and they do it anyway." Aaron Jennen expressed frustration with lawmakers, saying a rare opportunity to address serious problems in the state is being squandered. He cited statistics ranking Arkansas 49th in the nation in health care with the highest maternal and third-highest infant mortality rates in the nation, second only to Mississippi in the teen birth rate and second-highest in hunger. "These are real problems," he said, "and when you have a budget surplus like we do, these are solvable problems, right? But instead, they take up all this time, all this energy, all this taxpayer money to legislate a fraction of a fractional portion of Arkansans out of existence. "Imagine what those rankings would be if they took all the time and effort they're spending on this issue and redirected it to those issues," he continued. According to the Arkansas House of Representatives, the state ended fiscal year 2022 with a $1.682 billion budget surplus. According to the UCLA Williams Institute, there are 13,500 transgender adults aged 18 or older in Arkansas and up to 1,800 transgender youth younger than 18 in the state, comprising an estimated 0.7% of the state's population of 3 million people. Attempts to contact sponsoring legislators and the governor's office regarding the current wave of anti-trans legislation were met with little success. Stubblefield, Payton and Bentley did not return messages seeking comment on the bills they introduced. Long responded in an email saying he did not wish to be interviewed. The governor's office responded with a prepared statement but did not respond to a follow-up email. "The Governor has said she will sign laws that focus on protecting and educating our kids, not indoctrinating them and believes our schools are no place for the radical left's woke agenda," said spokeswoman Alexa Henning in an email. "Arkansas isn't going to rewrite the rules of biology just to please a handful of far-left advocates." Both families said that lately, leaving Arkansas is an option never far from their minds. Every day after work, Aaron Jennen said, he checks two alerts on his home computer. One is a daily update and digest of pending legislation. The other is a list of Department of Justice job postings in other states that protect transgender rights. Sabrina, who will begin college in the fall, said she received a generous scholarship offer from Hendrix College in Conway but said the current political climate is a concern. "I wanted to stay in state because I really, really like [Arkansas]," she said, "but [Arkansas] really doesn't like me." "We love this state," Aaron echoed. "We've lived here all our lives and we don't want to leave, but as parents, we have to do what is best for our children ... I'm not going to live in a place where my daughter can't go to the bathroom." "If we need to leave it's not going to be easy," said Dylan. "We'll make it work but it's definitely not going to be easy." Both families said the difficulty is because their home communities, Greenwood and Fayetteville, have been supportive of their families. But they said whether the laws being passed reflect the sentiments of their home communities or not, passage of those laws will endanger their children's health and futures regardless of where they live in Arkansas.

         SILOAM SPRINGS -- The team behind Discover Siloam Springs is excited to announce a new event coming to Memorial Park in Siloam Springs this summer. Fourth Friday will be a monthly, family-friendly event that will turn downtown into a big block party for the community, according to organizers. There will be free activities, local crafters, small businesses, nonprofit groups, food trucks and live music starting in May and running through October. "We are so excited to see this new event come to life," said Lindsey Taylor of Discover Siloam Springs and the Siloam Springs Chamber of Commerce. "Not only will this be a fun way to support our local business community, it's also an opportunity for families to come together and enjoy the wonderful community that we have here in Siloam Springs. During the Dogwood Festival, there is so much energy in downtown Siloam Springs, and we get to continue that through the entire summer with Fourth Fridays." The inaugural Fourth Friday will take place from 4-8 p.m. May 26 with an Americana theme as the community celebrates the United States and honors those who have served in the military. Musician Shannon Wurst will kick off the Summer Concert Series that evening after a special Memorial Day program starting at 6:30 p.m. at the Chautauqua Amphitheater. "Get ready for some awesome tunes this summer," said Megan Whitworth of Discover Siloam Springs and the City of Siloam Springs. "Each Fourth Friday will feature a concert. NWA Jazz & More, Samantha Crain, Brick Fields and 449 Rewind are some of the artists that will be coming to Siloam. I'm so excited and pumped for Fourth Fridays. It's going to be an incredible time for all." Each Fourth Friday will have a theme. In addition to May, June 23 is Bike Night, July 28 is Art Fest, Aug. 25 is Dog Days of Summer, Sept. 22 is Hometown Heroes and Oct. 27 is Monster Mash. Vendor applications are now open. Commercial vendors can reserve a space for booth space for $20. There is an option to reserve a booth space for all Fourth Fridays for $100. Nonprofit groups can reserve booth space for no charge. Visit DiscoverSiloam.com for vendor guidelines and to fill out an application. "The Discover Siloam team and committee have done an amazing job collaborating and planning this family-friendly event; we can't wait to share it with you," said Abby Trinidad of Discover Siloam Springs and Siloam Springs Main Street.

         BELLA VISTA -- A wide variety of professions were represented at Cooper Elementary's first career day on March 17. Professionals visited classrooms from 8-10 a.m. giving presentations about their careers and answering students' questions. Careers represented included attorney, physical therapist, teacher, HVAC technician, police officer, hair stylist, nursing home caregiver, civil engineer, radio host and more. Shannon Tweedy's fourth-grade class was visited by Bella Vista firefighters and paramedics Katie Gallagher, Jayson Steeley and Battalion Chief/EMS Coordinator Leon Lieutard. Lieutard said being a firefighter is like being a scientist because paramedics get to learn about the human body, fluids and homeostasis. With a student as his "patient," he demonstrated how a machine from an ambulance works that shows the heartbeat and oxygen saturation. He also said there are medications on the ambulance that can make the heart beat faster or slower, and that paramedics can do almost everything the emergency room can do except for X-rays and stitches. "It's not just putting out fires and rescuing cats; we also learn all about the human body," he said. Steeley, who was already wearing a firefighter turnout, put on a mask, hood, helmet and air pack to show students what firefighters would look like in a fire. Steeley walked through the classroom and gave high-fives to the students. In response to a question, Gallagher noted there are not a lot of fires in Bella Vista like there are in California. She said there are fires in the ravines at times, but only the top layer burns because there is moisture below that, and it does not get out of control like the fires in California. Lieutard told students that firefighters use algebra to determine the gallons per minute flowing out of a hose and also use math to determine dosages of medications. One of the firefighters' radios went off during the presentation with a tone followed by an alert of a structure fire. Gallagher explained that, after the tone, the dispatcher lets firefighters know where to go for the incident. Students asked whether they had to go, and they assured the students that the fire was on the other side of town and other firefighters were much closer, and also it was their day off. After answering a few questions, the firefighters moved on to another class. Next to visit Tweedy's class was Alison Nation, who worked 14 years for Crystal Bridges in Bentonville and has worked for four weeks for Visit Bentonville. She said she earned a bachelor of fine arts degree in studio art then moved to Arkansas where she earned a master's degree in ceramics. She started working at Crystal Bridges in 2008. For 10 years she worked on the communications team, creating content for the website, social media and email lists. For four years she worked as marketing director, creating advertisements targeting visitors who could get to Crystal Bridges in a four-hour drive. Sometimes she worked with Visit Bentonville, she said. She noted there are many jobs at Crystal Bridges, including watching over the art and keeping it safe, controlling the air to keep it the right temperature to preserve the art or being an art historian who decides which pieces to put in the museum. Visit Bentonville is a small company, she said, that tries to reach people to travel to Bentonville and hopefully get them to stay in a hotel and eat at a local restaurant and tell their friends about it. The company also funds projects, including the splash pad at Lawrence Plaza. It is funding turf at the softball fields in Memorial Park, she said. It grants funding requests for organizations, such as the Bentonville Half Marathon and Soar Arkansas, a hot air balloon event. Principal Josh Vest said students, staff and visitors enjoyed the event. "We want our community to be involved in our school, and we want our students exposed to the careers of today and tomorrow. Today was a great way to tackle both of those things," he said. Elandrea Dumes, school counselor, said parents volunteered to speak at the school about their careers. "The event exceeded my expectations for sure," she said. "The presenters were engaging and held the student's interest. They talked about what level of education they obtained to be in that career, what duties they do day to day and why they love what they do. Students were also able to ask questions to expand their understanding of the careers that were presented. Career day benefited students by allowing them to be introduced first-hand to various careers that are offered right here in their community. It is my hope that students are now inspired to pursue a career that they may have never thought of."

         100 years ago March 27, 1923 More than 600 copies of the Bible will be placed in Little Rock hotel rooms during the next few days by The Gideons, the Christian commercial travelers' association of America, according to Louis H. Griffin of Chicago, national field secretary of the society, who is in Little Rock preparing for the state convention of the organization, to be held here April 14 and 15. 50 years ago March 27, 1973 A $6 million appropriation to provide free textbooks for public high school students cleared the House of Representatives Monday. The appropriation bill (HB 914) is sponsored by the Joint Budge Committee. The appropriation would be funded from the state revenue surplus. The bill now goes to the Senate. Both houses approved an administration bill -- now Act 5 of 1973 -- authorizing free textbooks for students in grades nine through 12. Until now, the state has provided free textbooks only for students in grades one through eight. 25 years ago March 27, 1998 Soccer fields, golf courses, tennis courts and community centers in North Little Rock need almost $6 million worth of upkeep and upgrades, but the Parks and Recreation Commission doesn't have the money. Even if the commission reduces those projected spending needs to $4 million, the bill paying off the bond would be $400,000 a year for 15 years, an impossible figure for the park budget, Interim Parks Director Hugh Earnest told the commission Thursday. "We can't do $400,000 a year," Earnest told commissioners gathered to discuss the city's future recreation needs. "With $200,000 a year, we can make it, but come budget time, decision-making will be grim and hard." The commission agreed to ask the City Council to help pay for such improvements as a new swimming pool at Glenview Community Center and more soccer fields for area youths. 10 years ago March 27, 2013 The Little Rock Board of Directors approved contracts for its Prevention, Intervention and Treatment programs Tuesday, awarding about $2.5 million to more than a dozen agencies and nonprofits. The contracts will fund after-school programs and programs for at-risk youth at targeted sites all over the city. City directors debated the contracts, the city's funding structure for the programs and the accountability of those programs for almost an hour before agreeing to shorten the contracts and approve them. The board also agreed to talk about a master planning process for youth services at a board retreat planned next month.  Print Headline: Other Days Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         Plans to bring a K1 Speed indoor, electric go-kart racing venue to Rogers have hit a speed bump. Frisco Station LLC, which operates the Frisco Station Mall, has objected to plans to lease space to K1 Speed at an adjacent building at 2111 W. Walnut St. 6420 Bentonville Rogers LLC, the company wanting to lease the space to K1 Speed, has filed a complaint in Benton County Circuit Court requesting a declaratory judgment on whether the proposed use of the property would violate previous agreements with Frisco Station. The complaint was electronically filed Thursday. Plans for the proposed go-kart facility involve the north side of the building at 2111 W. Walnut St. The building houses Benton County offices and Samaritan Shop. A Kmart department store used to be in the building. 6420 Bentonville Rogers bought the 5.3-acre parcel for $5.6 million in November, according to county property records. The property owner and the building's customers are allowed to use parking spaces owned by the mall, according to a parking and sign easement agreement dated 2004. Representatives of Frisco Station sent letters earlier this year to 6420 Bentonville Rogers objecting to a lease for the go-kart facility. In a Jan. 24 letter, Frisco Station expressed opposition to the proposed use and rezoning of the site, stating use of the property is limited by two reciprocal easement agreements between property owners, both dated January 1994. An indoor go-kart facility at 2111 W. Walnut St. would violate those reciprocal easement agreements, which prohibit places of "recreation and amusement" like theaters, billiard parlors and nightclubs, according to the letter signed by Frisco Station managing member Joseph Michael. An attorney representing Frisco Station reiterated the objection to the go-kart facility in a Feb. 10 letter and stated Frisco Station would take "appropriate legal action" if the agreements were violated. Representatives of 6420 Bentonville Rogers claim the reciprocal easement agreements don't prohibit leasing the building to K1 Speed. Frisco Station previously attempted to lease one of its properties – the former location of Hobby Lobby, which is vacant -- to K1 Speed, according to the complaint filed in Benton County Circuit Court. The complaint states a lease between K1 Speed and 6420 Bentonville Rogers would be consistent with Frisco Station's attempt to lease its own space to K1 Speed. The city approved a conditional use permit and a rezoning related to the proposed go-kart facility. The Planning Commission approved the permit Jan. 3. The rezoning was approved by the commission Feb. 7 and by the City Council on Feb. 14. "While the city may have approved the rezoning of the property, such approval does not alter my client's objection to the prohibited use on the property," the Feb. 10 letter from Frisco Station stated. City staff recommended the rezoning in order to bring the property at 2111 W. Walnut St. into compliance with the city's comprehensive growth map, which guides development decisions in the city. At the Jan. 7 commission meeting, an attorney representing Frisco Station spoke against the rezoning. Commissioner John Schmelzle said at the time the commission has its own criteria for land use and isn't able to get into a private dispute. A Rogers location of K1 Speed would be the first in Arkansas, according to the company's website. The California-based company was founded in 2003 and has expanded to more than 60 kart racing locations across the world, including locations in Dallas and Arlington, Texas. The entertainment venue aims to appeal to casual racers, enthusiasts and gatherings like birthday parties and corporate events, a previous permit application stated. According to the company's website, the 20-horsepower electric karts for adults can reach 45 mph. Junior karts can reach 20 mph.

         Editor's note: The Arkansas Department of Health is changing how it labels violations. During this process, both newer and older terms may appear. Violations marked as priority contribute directly to the elimination, prevention or reduction in the hazards associated with foodborne illness. Priority violations include prevention of contamination, cooking, reheating, cooling and handwashing. Priority foundation rules support, facilitate, or enable one or more priority items. Core violations include items that usually relate to general sanitation, operational controls, equipment design or general maintenance. Critical violations are those factors leading to foodborne illness and must be corrected immediately. Noncritical violations relate to maintenance of food operations and cleanliness.

         Ayana Gray's "Beasts of Prey" series will be the featured work for the 2023 "If All Arkansas Read the Same Book," the Arkansas Center for the Book at the Arkansas State Library has announced. Gray's debut novel, "Beasts of Prey," was published in the fall of 2021. "Beasts of Ruin," published in 2022, is the second novel in the series. In the series, fate binds a beast keeper and a warrior-in-training together as they unravel mysteries that threaten their home. The third novel in the series is forthcoming. Gray is a bestselling young adult fantasy author and a lover of all things monsters, mythos and magic. Originally from Atlanta, she now lives in Little Rock. This will be the first time since 2019 that the "If All Arkansas Read the Same Book" program will be live and in person. Three events are planned for the summer, with more information available at a later date on the Arkansas State Library website: https://www.library.arkansas.gov/. The events are scheduled for: June 8: Fort Smith Public Library. July 15: Cabot Public Library. Aug. 5: Monticello Branch Library. Admission to all events will be free and open to the public. The Arkansas State Library is a division of the Arkansas Department of Education. The "If All Arkansas Read the Same Book" community-read project is funded in part by a grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services. Copies of "Beasts of Prey" will soon be available at all public libraries throughout the state.

         Editor's note: The Arkansas Department of Health is changing how it labels violations. During this process, both newer and older terms may appear. Violations marked as priority contribute directly to the elimination, prevention or reduction in the hazards associated with foodborne illness. Priority violations include prevention of contamination, cooking, reheating, cooling and handwashing. Priority foundation rules support, facilitate or enable, one or more priority items. Core violations include items that usually relate to general sanitation, operational controls, equipment design or general maintenance. Critical violations are those factors leading to foodborne illness and must be corrected immediately. Noncritical violations relate to maintenance of food operations and cleanliness.

         Four men were killed in crashes on Arkansas roads Tuesday, Friday and Saturday, according to preliminary fatality reports. Bobby Brown, 82, of Donaldson was fatally injured around 8:50 a.m. Tuesday on Antioch Road near Malvern when the 1994 Toyota he was driving left the road and struck a tree, according to a state police report. Othello King, 76, of Monticello was killed around 4:19 p.m. Tuesday when the 2003 Buick LeSabre he was driving on Arkansas 138 near Grizzel Lane northeast of Monticello crashed into a ditch, according to a report from the Drew County Sheriff's Office. A driver behind King said he was driving slow and swerving before he accelerated for an unknown reason and left the road, the report says. Daniel Eskandarian, 22, of Beebe was killed in a single-car crash at 2:48 p.m. Friday on Interstate 40 in Conway, according to a state police report. Eskandarian was driving east on I-40 in a 2016 Kia Soul, the report says. Near mile marker 134, the car went off the road to the left and slid sideways, beginning to overturn before hitting a tree, the report says. Bruno Sanchez IV, 46, of Pearcy was killed at 11:32 a.m. Saturday in a collision on Amity Road southwest of Hot Springs, according to a state police report. Sanchez was driving a 2004 BMW 330I west at a high speed when he collided with a 2012 Chevrolet Malibu that was turning onto Amity Road from Rush Fork Road, the report says. Sanchez's vehicle struck a tree on the south side of the road after the impact, the report says.

        A suspect was taken into custody after a standoff that started around 3 a.m., the North Little Rock police said on Twitter just after 7:20 a.m. Sunday. Trice Dawkins, 48, of North Little Rock was arrested “without incident” after a several hours-long standoff with police on Sunday, a news release from the police said. Before the standoff, police responded to a residence on the 700 block of W. 16th St. and found a victim whod been stabbed, the release said. The victim was taken to a local hospital and is said to be in stable condition, police said. Officers then learned that Dawkins was barricaded inside the residence, the release said. Dawkins has been charged with first-degree domestic battery, the release said. She is being held in the Pulaski County jail without bond.  The investigation is ongoing.

         Anyone who's driven in Northwest Arkansas for any length of time has been there: You're driving along at the speed of normal traffic, brake lights ahead begin to flicker then stay on and the next thing you know -- if you were able to stop in time -- you're sitting in a three-lane parking lot with several hundred of your friends and neighbors hoping to crawl to the next exit so you can try to find an alternate route. It might be caused by an accident, bad weather, a ball game or other event or just too many cars for the amount of road available that time of day. Regional planners want to work with cities, counties and the state to make driving easier, safer and more efficient, even as the population continues to grow at one of the fastest rates in the nation. They're working right now on drafts of two plans compiled by Cambridge Systematics, aimed at making that happen over the next five, 10 and 20 years. Transportation systems management and operations are strategies focused on operational improvements to maintain or restore the performance of the existing transportation system before extra capacity is needed. The strategies are often low-cost relative to adding capacity to existing roads. They frequently are high-impact actions that can be implemented more quickly than a traditional road building project. Intelligent transportation systems are the application of electronic technologies and communications to increase the safety and efficiency of roads. The approach allows officials to plan for what they want their system to look like in the long-term and then break the system into smaller pieces that can be implemented over time as funding permits. "Transportation systems management and operations is a focus on how you're managing your roadway system on a day-to-day basis," said Tim Conklin, executive director at the Northwest Arkansas Regional Planning Commission. "The intelligent transportation system is more about the technology and the types of technology communities use. We use technology to manage the system, and there's some obvious overlap in there." Together, the two initiatives touch on just about everything from traffic light technology to public transit and economics to demographics. Regional planning last updated its intelligent transportation plan in 2007. "A lot has changed. Obviously, the technology has changed, the region has changed," Conklin said. "When it takes an hour to go from Springdale to Centerton, we do have traffic congestion in Northwest Arkansas beyond what some people may think." Compared to other areas, Northwest Arkansas is playing catch-up on using technology such as traffic cameras, traffic signal timing and coordination and traveler information systems. "We did this capability study to see where we're at, and I'd say it's no surprise that we're in the beginning stages," Conklin said. "We're not very advanced in our region with regard to using a system management approach, but as we approach a million population, you're going to need to do more and more." The Fayetteville-Springdale-Rogers metro area population was 546,725 in the 2020 census. Conklin said a regional approach is critical because Northwest Arkansas is composed of multiple smaller cities. "Bigger cities and even smaller urban areas than us have real time traveler information on their interstate and freeway systems," Conklin said. "We don't have one big central city; it requires everybody to work together and try to identify some things we can work on." Chris Brown, public works director for Fayetteville, said the plans will set the stage for a regional approach to traffic management. "Especially as technology continues to advance and connected vehicles become more prevalent, it will be important to understand how the various cities' traffic signals can communicate with each other to create a seamless experience for drivers," Brown said. "As the cities continue to invest in the newest technology, standardizing as much as possible throughout the region will be beneficial for all." The future planners envision is not that far away, Conklin said. "With the advances in technology, I think it's sooner than later," he said. On the horizon Systems management planning will be focused on the roads connecting cities in the region rather than on the internal network in the cities themselves, according to the plans. One option would be coordinating with cities in the region and the Arkansas Department of Transportation to establish a regional transportation management center that would manage traffic using real-time traffic data from cameras, speed sensors and other equipment to mitigate congestion from a central location. The information is collected and then analyzed to make modifications using automated systems, such as connected traffic lights and message boards. Special software allows an operator in the transportation management center to communicate directly with field equipment and modify traffic signal programs in real time, for example. Another could be having coordinated traffic management systems on all the major roads in the region. Coordinated signal timing, for example, synchronizes traffic movements and manages speed for uninterrupted traffic flow along a corridor. It can also be used to vary speed limits under certain conditions, allow emergency vehicles to preempt traffic signals at intersections or allow transit buses to extend a green light so they can get through an intersection. Currently, each of the cities is responsible for maintaining and operating the traffic signals within its jurisdiction. The methods for signal operation and the level of technology used vary widely within the region. Traffic signals in the region generally have equipment for vehicle detection, video capture, signal controllers and communications. All of the bigger cities have the capability to monitor video feeds and signal operations remotely from city offices, according to the draft plans. Several of the cities have centers for monitoring their signal system and taking corrective actions when necessary. Springdale evaluated adaptive signal timing, using traffic sensors to modify signal timing in response to demand, at eight traffic signals along a 3-mile section of Thompson Street in 2010, and it's still using it. The city also looking into other artificial intelligence applications. Most of the larger cities have the capability for signal preemption for emergency vehicles. Some have systems that could provide preemption for transit vehicles, but none is using that capability now. Given the right technology, lanes could be reversed to switch the direction of traffic flow during certain times and conditions in order to use existing infrastructure more efficiently. Ramp meters, controllable traffic lights that regulate the flow of traffic entering freeways based on current traffic conditions, could be used to slow the flow of vehicles from on-ramps onto a highway during peak periods of congestion. A national focus The federal government also is pushing investments in technology and data to improve transportation systems across the country. The U.S. Department of Transportation on Tuesday announced the first round of grants totaling over $94 million for 59 projects across the country through the new Strengthening Mobility and Revolutionizing Transportation grants program. "Every major advancement in the history of U.S. transportation has involved technological progress," said U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. "The investments we are making today are about fostering innovations that improve people's day-to-day lives, making transportation safer, more reliable, more efficient and more sustainable." The competitive grant program provides state, local and tribal governments $500 million over five years to leverage technology to create safer and more equitable, efficient and innovative transportation systems. The first year of the program was oversubscribed, meaning that for every $1 available for grants, $6 worth of project funding was sought. The maximum award per project was $2 million for that round of funding. Communities are urged to use the grants to target real-world challenges where the use of new technologies and approaches can create benefits. No projects in Arkansas were awarded money this time around. The next funding opportunity of $100 million is expected to be released in the fall. Regional planners said they did not apply for money in the first round because their new plans were not mature enough when the the call for projects went out. They're hoping to apply after the plans are approved by the regional planning commission board. "We are looking into that," Conklin said. "Ideally, we'll find planning partners that are also interested."  Public input sought The Northwest Arkansas Regional Planning Commission is soliciting public comment on the draft Transportation Systems Management and Operations and Intelligent Transportation Systems documents. Drafts of the two traffic management plans are available at https://www.nwarpc.org/tsmo/ and https://www.nwarpc.org/its/. The public comment period will run through Friday.

         With the Arkansas General Assembly returning to the state Capitol on Monday after taking a spring break, lawmakers say they plan to introduce public safety overhaul legislation, work on drafting the state's general revenue budget for the next fiscal year and begin considering whether to refer any proposed constitutional amendments to the voters in the 2024 general election. Before completing their work in the regular session, the Republican-dominated Legislature and GOP Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders must enact a Revenue Stabilization Act to distribute state general revenue to state-supported programs in fiscal 2024 starting July 1, and determine what to do with $1.3 billion in unallocated state surplus general revenue. Lawmakers will weigh whether to refer any of 33 proposed constitutional amendments submitted by lawmakers to voters in the 2024 general election. Lawmakers may refer up to three proposed constitutional amendments to voters. Sen. Ben Gilmore, R-Crossett, who has been working on public safety legislation with Rep. Jimmy Gazaway, R-Paragould, said Friday that he and Gazaway are looking forward to filing the bill early this week. "This legislation will contain bold transformational reforms to our criminal justice system that will make our communities safer, crack down on violent repeat offenders, protect the victims of crime, and improve much-needed mental health and re-entry programs in order to address the root causes of crime," he said in a written statement. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Gary Stubblefield, R-Branch, said that he expects the committee to consider the public safety bill this week. Sen. Jonathan Dismang, R-Searcy, a co-chairman of the Joint Budget Committee, said Thursday that a proposed Revenue Stabilization Act for fiscal 2024, starting July 1, could be made public as early as the middle of this week, after discussions with legislative leaders and other state lawmakers. "I think we'll be within that 3[%] to 4% range" for a proposed increase in the state's general revenue budget for fiscal 2024, Dismang said. "We will be prudent," he said. In November, then-Gov. Asa Hutchinson proposed a $314 million increase in the state's general revenue budget to $6.33 billion in fiscal 2024, starting July 1, 2023, with $200 million of the increase earmarked for public schools. At that time, the former Republican governor said his proposed budget for fiscal 2024 would represent a 5.2% increase over the current budget of $6.02 billion, leaving a projected general revenue surplus of $254.9 million at the end of fiscal 2024. Considering annual inflation was more than 8% at that time, limiting the growth of the state's general revenue budget to 5.2% reflects conservative budgeting, he said. The state Department of Education has projected Sanders' education overhaul law, Act 237, will cost $297.5 million, including $150 million in "new money" in fiscal 2024. Act 237 raises the state's minimum teacher salary from $36,000 to $50,000 a year, grants other teachers $2,000 salary increases, creates Educational Freedom Accounts to help students attend private schools, parochial schools or home school, and enacts many other changes in the education system. House Bill 1688 by House Education Committee Chairman Brian Evans, R-Cabot, would increase per-student foundation funding by $205 to $7,618 for the 2023-2024 school year and to $7,771 for the 2024-2025 school year. Full-time classified staff, bus drivers, custodians and other school workers would receive funding for about a $2-per-hour raise, Evans said. In addition, the state would fund a 1.8% cost-of-living adjustment for teachers and school secretaries in fiscal year 2024 and a 2.2% increase in fiscal year 2025, he said. Dismang said state lawmakers could set aside $400 million or $500 million from the state's $1.3 billion in unallocated general revenue surplus to cover the state's share of the cost of public school building projects over the next several years under one proposal. The surplus money could replace the general revenue allocated for school building projects in the Revenue Stabilization Act under this proposal, he said. The general revenue budget for the educational facilities partnership is $70.3 million in fiscal 2023, and Hutchinson proposed maintaining that funding in fiscal 2024 in his proposed general revenue budget. "At this point, we are going to be setting aside the money, but how that it ultimately is carried out will be a future discussion, how it is utilized," Dismang said. In his budget proposal, Hutchinson set aside $41 million in general revenue in fiscal year 2024 for an overhaul of the state's pay plan for executive branch employees. Sanders announced March 15 that she will not support a broad-based pay plan increase, saying Arkansas taxpayers should not be saddled with the $80 million total cost -- factoring in expenses from general revenue as well as other sources -- for a proposal that doesn't consider the strategic needs in education, public safety, health care and corrections. She asked the Department of Transformation and Shared Services to review and rework the existing classification and compensation structure. The plan covers more than 22,000 executive branch employees. As far as other potential uses of the unallocated surplus, Dismang said that "there has been a lot of discussion about the [state Crime Laboratory and] the need for additional prison space." "There are some very large projects that absorb quite a bit of that surplus," he said. Regarding how much of the surplus could be set aside for additional prison beds and a new Crime Laboratory building, Dismang said that "that needs to be a much bigger discussion that we have not fully vetted amongst the folks that should be involved." He said he believes that state lawmakers should look at cutting income tax rates, retroactive to Jan. 1, 2023, and "then an additional step that would go [into effect] on Jan. 1, 2024." "The exact amount I am not sure we have reached agreement on that, but that is what I would personally like to see," Dismang said. "Because of everything that we have happening in year three, four or five I don't think that we need to create some type of trigger or whatever it may be to implement [further income tax cuts] in the future. We can always look at that when we get back in session two years from now." House Revenue and Taxation Committee Chairman Les Eaves, R-Searcy, said, "We should be able to do up to two-tenths of a [percentage point] reduction" in the individual income tax rate, with triggers to safeguard it. The state's top individual income tax rate is 4.9%. The state's top corporate income tax rate is 5.3%. State Department of Finance and Administration spokesman Scott Hardin said, "While we don't have a formal revenue impact for a reduction of the top rate to 4.7%, we do know the following based on previous research: Between 4.9% and 4.0%, the reduction of each tenth of a [percentage point] represents approximately $50 million in revenue." CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS Rep. Dwight Tosh, R-Jonesboro, said Thursday that the House State Agencies and Governmental Affairs Committee that he chairs will hear presentations on Monday afternoon, after the House adjourns, from representatives who sponsored proposed constitutional amendments . Representatives filed 13 proposed amendments, but three are shells lacking details. Tosh said he hopes the committee decides what amendments it wants to recommend to the House by the end of this week. "I have not heard of an amendment that everybody is really excited about," Tosh said. Rep. Robin Lundstrum, R-Elm Springs, has 53 representatives who are co-sponsors for her House Joint Resolution 1006, which is a proposed constitutional amendment aimed at allowing the lottery's net proceeds to be used to fund or provide scholarships or grants to Arkansans enrolled in vocational-technical schools and technical institutes. She said Friday that her aim is to fund "'hard' vocational training needs such as LPN nursing, trucking, HVAC, electrical, refrigeration, industrial maintenance ... mechanical, plumbing, etc." Sen. Blake Johnson, R-Corning, said the Senate State Agencies and Governmental Affairs Committee will hear presentations Thursday from senators who proposed constitutional amendments, but it probably won't make decisions about whether to recommend any proposals to the Senate until the following week. Senators have filed 20 proposed amendments, but 11 are shells lacking details. Senate President Pro Tempore Bart Hester, R-Cave Springs, who serves on the Senate State Agencies and Governmental Affairs Committee, said, "I don't know any [proposed constitutional amendments] that the overall membership is super excited about. "We like the victims' bill of rights," he said, referring to the Senate Joint Resolution 10 by Sen. Dave Wallace, R-Leachville, which is aimed at providing rights for victims of criminal offenses or delinquent acts. Last month, Wallace said Sanders' staff provided the proposal to him and asked him to run the proposal for her. "I think it has to be something that a super majority of us are excited about to send out something out, but we'll see," Hester said. Under Wallace's proposal, a victim would have 10 specified rights that "shall be protected in a manner no less vigorous than the rights afforded to the accused" in order to preserve and protect justice for victims and due process throughout the criminal and juvenile justice systems. These rights would range from the right to be treated with fairness and respect for the victim's safety, dignity and privacy, to the right to "refuse an interview, deposition or other discovery request made by the accused or any person acting on the behalf of the accused," to the right to full and timely restitution. The proposed amendment states that it would not create any cause of action for compensation or damages against the state; any political subdivision of the state; any officer, employee or agent of the state or any of its political subdivisions; or any officer or employee of the court. SOCIAL ISSUES The House is expected on Monday to consider a bill that would prohibit school staff from addressing students by a pronoun inconsistent with the student's "biological sex," unless they have written permission from a parent. House Bill 1468, by Rep. Wayne Long, R-Bradford, is listed as the first regular bill for consideration on the House agenda for Monday. Meanwhile, Stubblefield said the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday will likely consider concurrence on a House amendment to a bill that would strike a defense statute from state code protecting librarians from criminal liability under state obscenity laws. Senate Bill 81, by Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Jonesboro, which also aims to create an offense for "furnishing a harmful item to a minor" and a process for challenging books available to children in public and school libraries, passed the House earlier this month. A House amendment to the bill would allow committees of librarians and bodies of local elected officials to require a school or public library to "relocate" challenged books within their library rather than "remove" them. Also, the House Committee on Judiciary has scheduled a special order of business on Tuesday for Senate Bill 270 by Sen. John Payton, R-Wilburn. The bill aims to create a criminal penalty for knowingly entering and remaining in a bathroom of the opposite sex while a minor is present. The legislation narrowly cleared the Senate earlier this month. Payton has said the bill is needed to protect children. Opponents have claimed the legislation would create the most extreme bathroom ban in the country. OTHER ISSUES The House Committee on City, County, and Local Affairs is scheduled on Wednesday to consider a bill that aims to bar local governments from creating certain restrictions on short-term rentals, said committee Chairman Rep. Lanny Fite, R-Benton, on Thursday. Senate Bill 197, by Sen. Joshua Bryant and Rep. Brit McKenzie, both Republicans from Rogers, drew extended testimony during a meeting of the House panel earlier this month. Since the meeting, an amendment filed by McKenzie has been engrossed. Fite said it's likely his committee on Wednesday would also consider House Bill 1616 by Rep. Frances Cavenaugh, R-Walnut Ridge, which aims to allow local jurisdictions to post certain notices on an independent third-party website subject to state audit. The bill is a new version of a measure Cavenaugh filed earlier this session. Under the original bill, counties and municipalities could post notices related to delinquent taxes, elections, ordinances, delinquent properties and financial statements on a nongovernmental third-party site. HB1616 would allow local governments to post more kinds of notices to the permitted website. Unlike the original bill, which would have phased in online notices at yearly intervals over five years, HB1616 would require jurisdictions to wait five years before posting any of the permitted notices online. END OF SESSION Monday will be the 78th day of the regular session. The House and Senate have approved a resolution that cleared the way for the chambers to recess for a spring break that started on March 16 with lawmakers returning on Monday, as well as a resolution to extend the regular session beyond 60 days and to recess April 7 or at an earlier date agreed upon by the House and Senate. Hester said Friday that "we will know by Wednesday," whether the Legislature will be able to complete its work in the regular session by April 7. House Speaker Matthew Shepherd, R-El Dorado, said Friday he'll probably know by the middle of this week "about whether [April 7] is a viable target for us" to complete action in the regular session. It would require a three-fourths vote of the 100-member House and the 35-member Senate to extend the session beyond April 7. April 7 would be the 89th day of the session. April 14 would be the 96th day, and April 21 would be the 103rd. The regular session lasted 118 days in 2021 and was 30 days longer than the 88-day regular session in 2019. The regular session lasted 86 days in 2017 and 82 days in 2015. Information for this article was contributed by Neal Earley of the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette.

         The Arkansas Scholarship Lottery has a new mobile application -- AR Lottery + Club -- with the aim of making it easier for players to use and providing several new features. The new app is available through the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. Mike Smith, the lottery's gaming director, said the app became available to the public on Jan. 27, and during the first week alone over 100,000 tickets were checked using the new ticket checker feature. "The first week the app launched we saw a 31% increase in new users compared to the week prior," he said Thursday in a written statement. "1,919,761 tickets were entered into the program using the new app during the first month as compared to 1,842,017 tickets entered the month prior." A lottery vendor, Scientific Games International, developed the new app for the Arkansas Scholarship Lottery to give players more convenience when connecting to the lottery, its games and its player loyalty program, the Club, Scientific Games International said Wednesday in a news release. "The Arkansas Scholarship Lottery wanted to offer our players a modern experience and convenient, easy connection to our games and loyalty club from their mobile device," Smith said in the release. "With the new app, players verify tickets easily with the ticket checker and create digital playslips from the convenience of their phone," he said. Biometric login makes it easy for players to access their Club account via the new app, Smith said. The app's all-new ticket checker feature allows players to quickly check whether their tickets are winners, he said. Players can also use the app to create digital playslips which save their lucky numbers and play options, then scan the QR code at any Arkansas Scholarship Lottery retailer to quickly purchase games, he said. Like the previous version of the lottery's app, players may connect to the Club to enter non-winning instant tickets in Play It Again drawings and other second-chance promotions, Smith said. They can also enter eligible instant and terminal-generated tickets to earn Points for Prizes that are redeemable in the online store. The Arkansas Scholarship Lottery mobile app has been available for players since 2015. In 2009, Scientific Games and the Arkansas lottery launched the first lottery loyalty program in the U.S., according to Scientific Games International. The company said the lottery's loyalty program is one of the most successful in the industry with more than 101.5 million tickets entered into the program since its inception, and the program has awarded more than 1.2 billion points to players to redeem Points for Prizes in Scientific Games' online store. Lottery Director Eric Hagler said the lottery had worked on the new app for about a year before launching it two months ago. He noted that lottery players "will still not be able to purchase tickets through the mobile app at this time." In March 2020, the lottery started a pilot program with Jackpocket Inc. to offer sales of lottery games through a mobile app, but a physical ticket generated from a licensed lottery retailer is required, according to the lottery. Only draw tickets may be purchased through Jackpocket, but Winners Corner in Little Rock is Jackpocket's licensed retailer, and the store sells instant tickets on site, said Scott Hardin, a spokesperson for the state Department of Finance and Administration. In its strategic plan developed last year for the following five years, the Arkansas Scholarship Lottery says it will be necessary for the Arkansas General Assembly to strongly consider authorizing the lottery to launch an iLottery digital platform to sell tickets to remain competitive and current with consumer demand. In this year's regular session, legislation hasn't been introduced to authorize an iLottery digital platform. The lottery is currently authorized to distribute lottery games through a single distribution channel of brick-and-mortar retail establishments, the lottery said in its strategic plan, in what its management identified as one of four material weaknesses. Hagler said in December that the lottery is prepared for any contingency. "If there is no desire for iLottery, then we have a forward path in the mono-channel," he said in a written statement at that time. "If iLottery is authorized, then we will execute on that mandate, as well." The lottery's major term contracts expire in calendar year 2026, Hagler said. "If iLottery is desired, the ideal timing would be to align the launch with the implementation of new term contracts in 2026," he said in December. "This would mean that Lottery would need approval in 2025 in order to prepare for launch sometime in [calendar year] 2026-2027." Hardin said Friday that "Regarding iLottery, Lottery's position hasn't changed since late 2022." The lottery started selling tickets on Sept. 28, 2009. It has helped finance Arkansas Academic Challenge Scholarships for more than 30,000 students during 11 of the past dozen fiscal years.  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

            <h2>Child safety among aims in $592,000 renovation underway at Arkansas Governors Mansion</h2>

         Arkansas' Governor's Mansion is in the midst of a privately financed renovation with an estimated cost of $592,000 for construction that started at the end of February and is tracking to wrap up at the end of April, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders' spokeswoman said. There were improvements that had to be made for the safety of Sanders' three children, and the project includes renovating the upstairs living space and bedrooms, spokeswoman Alexa Henning said. "This is the first time in decades young children have lived in the mansion," Henning said last week in a statement responding to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette's questions about the need for the renovation and the scope of the project. The Governor's Mansion Association is paying for the cost of the renovation with zero cost to the taxpayer, Henning said. The renovation's estimated cost is $592,000 for construction, with Baldwin & Shell Construction Co. as the contractor, she said. "The Governor and First Gentleman reviewed multiple bids and selected the lowest out of the options and most efficient for the renovation, which will come at zero cost to taxpayers," Henning said. Baldwin & Shell has completed a number of projects at the Governor's Mansion in the past, and "we know they will do a great job," she said. Asked whether one person and/or company or multiple people and/or companies are contributing money to cover the cost of the renovation, Henning replied in her statement, "Funding for this is provided by private donations received to the Governor's Mansion Association, a group that is committed to the preservation of the home used by Arkansas' governors to live and welcome Arkansans." Sanders is the daughter of Mike Huckabee, who served as the state's governor from July 1996 until 2007. She is a former White House press secretary for former President Donald Trump. A few groups have contacted the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette and indicated that they were planning to hold events at the Governor's Mansion in the past few months, but were informed they wouldn't be able to do so at that time. Asked why the mansion has been off limits for use by outside groups since Sanders was sworn in on Jan. 10, Henning said, "The mansion remains operational and has not been 'off limits' since the Governor was sworn in. "There was an event on MLK [Martin Luther King Jr.] Day at the mansion, and the Governor has hosted the GOP caucus multiple times," she said in her statement. There will also be events in April including the Governor's Scholastic Honors Day and Arkansas Prayer Breakfast, Henning said. "Governor Sanders and First Gentleman Bryan Sanders are excited about the improvements being made to the Mansion --at zero costs to taxpayers -- so their young family and future families can reside safely in the home," she said. "The Governor and First Gentleman are thankful to the Mansion Association Board for their work and commitment to improving the home," Henning said. "The mansion is an important and beautiful piece of history for Arkansans, and the Governor, First Gentleman, Scarlett, Huck, and George are looking forward to making it their home for the next eight years." Asked when outside groups will be allowed to use the mansion for events and how frequently that will be allowed and for what events, Henning said, "Regular events will be held once the renovations are complete, with young children, the Governor, and First Gentleman plan to hold more breakfast and lunch events while the kids are at school." Among the improvements at the mansion under former Gov. Asa Hutchinson's administration, a nearly $817,000 overhaul was wrapped up in the fall of 2018 after starting in the summer of 2016, according to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette's archives. While many of the grant-funded renovations were structural, numerous cosmetic improvements were made as well. A $1.1 million Arkansas Natural and Cultural Resources Council grant, financed through the state's real estate transfer tax, paid for the improvements, and the mansion later returned about $300,000 of the funding to the council. Since 1989, the first year that the council disbursed grants, the mansion has received several million dollars in council grants for renovations and expansions. The renovation during Hutchinson's administration came after his spokesman, J.R. Davis, said in May of 2016 that a rat infestation, structural problems and deferred maintenance warranted a change in the structure's supervising commission. Hutchinson signed into law legislation specifying that Governor's Mansion commissioners serve at the will of the governor and that the commission no longer makes rules concerning improvements and repairs at the mansion. Among the improvements at the mansion during former Gov. Mike Beebe's administration was extensive renovation of the grounds in 2007 and early 2008, according to the Democrat-Gazette's archives. The new landscaping was designed by nationally known Arkansas garden designer P. Allen Smith, who started the design work in 2006. Smith's intention was to create a garden space that reflects the state's natural beauty and its place in history. The gardens were made possible through fundraising efforts by the Governor's Mansion Association, including grant money from the Arkansas Natural and Cultural Resources Council, private money and the generosity of P. Allen Smith & Associates. In October 2006, the fundraising efforts of Sanders' mother, Janet Huckabee, were recognized with the dedication of the mansion's 13,950-square-foot Janet M. Huckabee Grand Hall, according to the Democrat-Gazette's archives. She led the fundraising that financed much of the $3 million hall. Janet Huckabee likes to say that visiting the Governor's Mansion is like "coming to the front door of Arkansas," and one of her objectives during her 10 years as the state's first lady was making it a nicer place to visit, according to a Democrat-Gazette article in October 2006. Before the opening of the Grand Hall in 2003, large events at the mansion were held outside in a heated tent. The Grand Hall was one of several construction projects that took place on the grounds during Huckabee's tenure as governor. In 2000, the Huckabees moved into a triple-wide mobile home during a $1.4 million renovation of the mansion that included new plumbing and wiring as well as the installation of an elevator and other accommodations for wheelchair users. They moved back into the Governor's Mansion in late 2001. The Governor's Mansion opened in 1950. Sid McMath was the first governor to live in the mansion.

         "It's just hard to contextualize and conceptualize time, I guess. Especially with something like [the Iraq War]. And the memories that you have of that event are still so visceral and real. It still seems near and immediate in a lot of ways." -- Maj. Gen. Jon Stubbs, Arkansas secretary of the military and adjutant general of the Arkansas National Guard on March 22, 2023. According to history books, America's second war in Iraq -- also known as "Operation Iraqi Freedom" -- began on Wednesday, March 19, 2003. That's when President George W. Bush's 48-hour ultimatum for Saddam Hussein and his sons to leave Iraq or face war at the "time of our choosing" ended at 7 p.m. CT. Sometime after, an arsenal that included 40 Tomahawk cruise missiles and 2,000-pound bombs called joint direct attack munitions were unleashed on the capital city of Baghdad in the early morning hours. Within 24 hours, coalition forces began crossing the Iraqi border on their way to Baghdad. The Iraq War, which would claim the lives of 4,598 American soldiers and hundreds of thousands of Iraqis, according to Brown University, would not officially be declared over for eight years. However, for some Arkansans involved in the conflict, their personal part of Operation Iraqi Freedom began well before March 2003 and ended years before 2011. PICTURES OF ME How long ago was 2003? Just look through Michael Strawn's "About Me Books." They're two three-ring binders full of certificates and pictures chronicling his first tour of duty in Iraq, from March 2003 to January 2004. Strawn, 49, flips through the picture binder during a break from his full-time job at Camp Robinson as part of medical readiness for the aviation unit. The world of 2003 -- when Strawn was a medic in the Arkansas National Guard's now-defunct 296th Ground Ambulance Company -- was one where physical film was still regularly used to document daily life. Some of Strawn's photos have the bright red dates in the lower right-hand corner -- like one documenting an apocalyptic-looking sandstorm on May 14, 2003 -- that say "you had to be there." There are plenty of moments not captured in Strawn's binder. Like his vivid memory from the week of Jan. 18, 2003. At the time, he worked in the Pulaski County sheriff's office. On Jan. 15, Strawn's wife Melanie gave birth to their first son, Jacob. A few days later, they pulled into their driveway in North Little Rock. As Melanie worked to get a baby seat out of their car, Strawn went to check the mail. He found a letter addressed to him from the Arkansas Military Department. "I remember seeing that letter and kind of having an idea before even opening it what was gonna be inside as she was fighting with the car seat," Strawn remembered. "That's what started it." Within a couple of weeks, Strawn was on active duty. When the 296th Ground Ambulance Company crossed the border from Kuwait into Iraq, Strawn's unit was a couple of days behind the initial invasion. However, the moment was still "very busy, very scary." They were driving in on ambulances packed to the brim with personal gear. "We were kind of like the Beverly Hillbillies, had stuff tied to the roof of the ambulance and stuff just about everywhere we could so that we could still use the back portion of the ambulance," Strawn said. "There was fear, but you were too busy really to think about it too much." As soon as his portion of the convoy was on the Iraqi side, "there were kids everywhere" crowding the vehicles as they drove by at 40 mph. One child managed to grab a pair of Oakley glasses off a platoon sergeant in the Humvee in front of him. "He lost his fancy sunglasses within the first minute of being in Iraq," Strawn recalled. 'NO KIDDING MOBILIZATION' The week Operation Iraqi Freedom got underway, Jon Stubbs of Searcy wasn't near a modern battlefield. He and his family were on spring break in Williamsburg, Va. "Obviously, I was very distracted," Stubbs recalled while sitting in his office at the Arkansas National Guard headquarters in North Little Rock. "I had some friends there, friends that were on active duty, that were part of the initial invasion, people I knew. So I was very, very distracted and had a hard time concentrating on the vacation, but I certainly remember it." In 2003, Stubbs was a 30-year-old captain in the Arkansas National Guard's 39th Infantry Brigade in command of Alpha Company, 2nd Battalion, which was headquartered in Walnut Ridge. He had never seen combat to that point. "We knew [Iraq] was going to be an all-hands-on-deck-type endeavor, and we knew it wasn't just going to be a quick thing," Stubbs said. That summer, his unit attended its annual training at Fort Chaffee in Fort Smith under the belief that they would eventually attend the Joint Readiness Training Center the following year. "But we got indications there at the end of that training period that 'hey, you guys might not be going to JRTC next year. You might be somewhere else.'" The weekend of July 27, the 3,000-member 39th Infantry Brigade was told to be prepared to be sent to Iraq. By Sept. 27, it received its marching orders. The brigade would spend a year in Iraq. After a month spent training in Walnut Ridge, the inevitable came Nov. 1 when Stubbs boarded a bus to Fort Hood in Texas. "It's one of those things you never forget," Stubbs said. "The reason I don't forget it is because I remember trick-or-treating with my young daughter. She was 7 at the time. And we were trick-or-treating in Pocahontas, Arkansas. That was our last night together before we left." Stubbs' first "No Kidding Mobilization" was in full swing. Five months later, on April 8, 2004 -- Stubbs' 32nd birthday -- he crossed from Kuwait into Iraq as a "lead element" of one of his battalion's first convoys. "As you come into Iraq, as you come closer to Baghdad, the intelligence reports pick up that troops are in contact and there are casualties and there's like a crescendo where all the training and all your experience and all your education that you've gone through up into that point in time, it kind of culminates and then you realize OK, you're fixing to put all that into practice." THE FORBIDDEN WORD Unlike Strawn and Stubbs, Brig. Gen. Riley Porter had already seen action in the Middle East when the Iraq War began. A former mayor of Helena with 20 years of National Guard experience, in 2002 Porter had a command position with the 376th Air Expeditionary Wing at Ganci Air Base in Kyrgyzstan as part of support for Operation Enduring Freedom. When he got the call to deploy to Iraq, Porter was a colonel in command of the 189th Airlift Wing at Little Rock Air Force Base. Also unlike Strawn and Stubbs, Porter would only spend four months in Iraq, from July to October 2003. Deploying by himself, Porter was the first Arkansas air guardsman to enter Iraq. He would command roughly 2,000 airmen in the 332nd Air Expeditionary Wing at Tallil Air Basein southern Iraq. At one point, Porter's mission was to make sure C-17 military transport planes were able to get to Balad Air Base, a former Iraqi base 40 miles north of Baghdad that was in "total chaos." That was the setup to a surreal experience for Porter's first time being embedded with the Army. "I had to show up there at night because of the security and we had no protection flying in there," Porter recalled. Upon arriving, he was led into a little room right around the time mortar fire was directed at the base. In the room sat a career Army general, "just a crusty old guy," and two colonels of Porter's same rank. "I walked in there and I kind of picked up on the ice that was in the air," Porter said. As the mortar fire was "pounding outside," the general asked Porter for his orders. Porter took them out of his green Army bag, which he called his "purse," and laid them out. After reading over them, the general told Porter to "tell me what you're going to do here." In the middle of Porter's spiel, he began saying "... I hope to have an easy ..." "Stop," the general ordered. "We don't use the word 'hope' around here," he said. "We assign somebody responsible for making it happen." Porter thought to himself, "what have I gotten myself into?" Continuing his speech, Porter said "we're gonna get this stuff set up for our customers ..." "Stop," the general repeated. "Soldiers are not customers. Customers have options. Soldiers don't." Finally, Porter told the general "if you have problems with my orders, you can call Gen. Buchanan and discuss it with him." The general relented and said, "at least you got your Army [bag]." "You mean my purse?" Porter asked. "Soldiers don't carry purses!" the general exploded. "You're lucky I don't have you on the ground doing push-ups!" "It really didn't start off on a good note," Porter said. WORST DAYS, CLOSE CALLS Nov. 20, 2004. It's etched in Stubbs' mind, like the Halloween night spent with his daughter and the birthday spent entering Iraq. "I'll never forget it," Stubbs says. "I think about it every 20th of November." That day marked the heaviest fighting the 39th Infantry Brigade saw in its first eight months on the ground. Located around a Iraqi police station in the Adhamiyah district in Baghdad, it started just after dawn and continued throughout the day. Eight roadside bombs and two car bombs were found or detonated near Stubbs' unit, Charlie Company, 3rd Battalion of the 153rd Infantry. According to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette's story from the time, the attack was apparent retaliation for a raid the previous day on the Abu Hanifa mosque -- the oldest Sunni mosque in Baghdad. "It was just a complex attack in the neighborhood that started with one of my platoons engaging a large group of insurgents in the vicinity of the police station there and it grew to me putting in another platoon," Stubbs recalled. "We had an adjacent unit get caught up in the fight. They had a killed in action. ... and it included dismounted insurgents, machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades and it included a [vehicle-borne] IED attack against one of my platoon ... had multiple wounded. It was just a very intense, intense day that, essentially it was an all-day thing. As I look back on it, that would probably be the most intense day that I had over there." Strawn's worst day in Iraq didn't include his closest call, but it's "the biggest thing I think about quite a bit." It occurred in the Ramadi/Fallujah area, where a group of five or six ambulances attached to different units had been sent. Ambulances could be attached to a unit for anywhere between a couple of days or a month before being reassigned. "My ambulance had been with this one unit for quite a while and we're getting ready to move to a new base," Strawn recalled. "The company commander was going out to scout the location and he got blown up. "I was supposed to be in the vehicle with him. But due to some last-minute changes I wasn't." "A lot of the time I wonder about that," Strawn said. "If I had been in the truck, what would have happened? Would I have made it? Would I have been there to maybe help him because he didn't make it." Porter's closest call came in a rocket attack that could have been worse. One day he was on his way to chow hall when insurgent forces began "lobbing in some rockets" at his base. "We'd never had a rocket attack at that point." Porter remembers an Army officer yelling "Get down! Get down! Get down!" and four rockets impacting nearby. "One of them hit close enough to me that it blew me up in the air and put me up against ... a big concrete barrier" meant for protection. Porter was knocked out and hurt his shoulder. Unfortunately, four Army soldiers were killed. "I considered myself very, extremely lucky," Porter said. "We found out the next day I think it was ... they had cherry-wired together eight missiles ... They kind of laid them on a bank, just kind of angled them to go off. ... Four of them went off and four of them didn't." GETTING BACK/ACCLIMATING The process of leaving Baghdad and eventually Iraq after a year was "very, very surreal" for Stubbs. "When you cross the border and you start to download all your ammo, and you turn all your ammo in in Kuwait and you're without bullets," Stubbs recalled. "You go from being hypervigilant for essentially a year, locked and loaded, to use a slang term, to turning in your ammo. And I remember that just being almost jarring in some ways." Stubbs recalled being picked up in an SUV at a coalition staging area. "I came off my combat vehicle, away from the [military] radios, away from all this stuff and you get into an SUV with a radio and an air conditioner and a CD player and ... you're just kind of back in civilization. That's a very strange feeling. It was at that point in time you realize that 'hey, I'm gonna make it home.'" Eventually, back in the U.S., Stubbs drove home from Fort Sill in Oklahoma. He was greeted with a huge welcoming party by his family. The first thing Stubbs ate? Gumbo. "I love gumbo, so my dad fixed me ... homemade gumbo," Stubbs recalled. "There's no doubt I went on an eating frenzy in terms of good food." Even after the celebrations, the transition from deployment in the Middle East to being back home in Arkansas was jarring. "One day, you're in Baghdad," Stubbs said, closing a fist to emphasize his point while also briefly closing his eyes, likely recalling that stretch in the spring of 2005. "Three days later, or maybe two days later, you're in Kuwait. ... Then maybe five days later, you're back in the U.S. And then a couple of days after that, you're back in your living room." Stubbs "struggled mightily" upon his return stateside. "I'm not ashamed to share it," he says, recalling three or four months struggling in "relating to my wife, or relating to my young daughter at the time. I had a hard time communicating with people. ... I just wasn't ready to talk about it. I hadn't fully processed it." Strawn, who had received a two-week leave the previous fall, experienced many of the same feelings. That was on top of having missed almost the entire first year of his son's life. "I jokingly say I got to miss out on all the big diaper changes and the no sleeping at night," Stubbs says. "Staying on edge was difficult and it took a while, you know any little sound that everyone else is used to [would] make you kind of think about it for just a minute." Stubbs and his wife, Jane, were provided counseling to help in their reintegration process after essentially spending a year and a half apart. Stubbs acknowledges that as an active-duty Guardsman, he had access to resources that likely resulted in an easier time transitioning than others. "I was very blessed that I got to continue to wear a uniform, so it wasn't like I came back and had to go reintegrate into a civilian job," Stubbs said. "I came back to work at Camp Robinson ... I still had access to this environment all the time. You think about our traditional guardsmen, they came back, same experiences as I did. ... But they came back and they went back to a civilian career or they went back into school or maybe they didn't have a job. And you just think about how difficult that transition was. "Much more difficult." In all, Stubbs estimates that it took him about six months to return to a sense of normalcy. But normal only lasts so long in his field. Stubbs observed that within five months of many Operation Iraqi Freedom veterans returning home, they'd be called to respond to a disaster at home in August and September 2005. "I know that sounds kind of wacky, but ... a lot of the OIF veterans went straight into Hurricane Katrina down there in New Orleans," said Stubbs, noting that the fallout from the Category 5 hurricane "was a very chaotic, surreal environment in and of itself. "That's not far removed from being deployed." NOW Stubbs, now 51, leans back in an office chair, folds his hands in his lap and lets out a breath while looking at the ceiling, thinking about the question. "When I think about the Iraq War what is the lasting image?" Stubbs' eyes dart around a bit as he remembers the war, at least the war he experienced. "I don't know, it's just the faces of my soldiers," Stubbs answers after about 20 seconds. "That's the image. The faces of those that I served with." Stubbs sees some of those faces every day. On the wall opposite his desk is a shadow box. In it is a small American flag he bought in Kuwait before crossing into Iraq and put inside his body armor, where it stayed for his entire tour. Above the flag is a picture of Stubbs and three of his lieutenants posing in Baghdad. "That's what made the experience was the people," Stubbs says. "You served with extraordinary people that did extraordinary things, heroic things. These are people, these are our Arkansans, that just did extraordinary, heroic, incredibly brave things. That are just living in our communities in relative obscurity. Nobody knows. These are people that just came back here and went back to work." According to the Arkansas National Guard, 23 of its service members died in Iraq between 2004 and 2008. Of the men and women who made up the Arkansas Army and Air National Guard in March 2003, 830 are still in uniform today. That's 10% of the roughly 8,500-person force that Stubbs now commands as its adjutant general. What Stubbs experienced 19 years ago was a "foundational event." "It was monumental, transformative," Stubbs said. "It really brought home the importance of good training, of good leadership." He added that "it kind of put it all in perspective; it's not just training for training's sake. What we do, it has consequences if you don't do it right." One of the 830 Guard members still serving 20 years after the war is Strawn, but his time is limited. On the day he looked through his "About Me Books" at Camp Robinson, including the picture of him smoking a Cuban cigar with a friend after an ambulance run, Strawn was 52 days from retiring from a military career that began in the early 1990s. During a phone conversation a few days earlier, Strawn was unsure what his future held. "I'm ready for it," Strawn said. "Lately, I've been getting into a lot of hobbies, laser engraving, and I just got a 3-D printer." As for Operation Iraqi Freedom, it doesn't feel like it's been 20 years for Strawn. "When I talked to my buddies that were there, seems like it was maybe 10 years ago," Strawn observed. "I don't really think about the whys [of why we went to war] and especially the losses as much as what I did there and seeing the good changes that came out of it." When asked to compare his time in Iraq to Afghanistan, Porter called it a "loaded question." "Both of them were totally different motivations," Porter noted. "I was honored to serve in both locations, and honored to serve with all the people. I felt the Iraqi tour was most rewarding to me personally because of what was accomplished. I could sense that the Afghan [war] was going to drag on forever. ... Whereas Iraq ... I could see what we were doing could have an ultimate end. Of course, I didn't call that too well, did I?" While major combat operations were declared over in 2011, America continues to have a presence in Iraq. Twenty years after the bombs first fell and soldiers like Strawn streamed into the country, roughly 2,500 U.S soldiers still report for duty in Iraq.

         The Arkansas Scholarship Lottery has a new mobile application -- AR Lottery + Club -- with the aim of making it easier for players to use and providing several new features. The new app is available through the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. Mike Smith, the lottery's gaming director, said the app became available to the public on Jan. 27, and during the first week alone over 100,000 tickets were checked using the new ticket checker feature. "The first week the app launched we saw a 31% increase in new users compared to the week prior," he said Thursday in a written statement. "1,919,761 tickets were entered into the program using the new app during the first month as compared to 1,842,017 tickets entered the month prior." A lottery vendor, Scientific Games International, developed the new app for the Arkansas Scholarship Lottery to give players more convenience when connecting to the lottery, its games and its player loyalty program, the Club, Scientific Games International said Wednesday in a news release. "The Arkansas Scholarship Lottery wanted to offer our players a modern experience and convenient, easy connection to our games and loyalty club from their mobile device," Smith said in the release. "With the new app, players verify tickets easily with the ticket checker and create digital playslips from the convenience of their phone," he said. Biometric login makes it easy for players to access their Club account via the new app, Smith said. The app's all-new ticket checker feature allows players to quickly check whether their tickets are winners, he said. Players can also use the app to create digital playslips which save their lucky numbers and play options, then scan the QR code at any Arkansas Scholarship Lottery retailer to quickly purchase games, he said. Like the previous version of the lottery's app, players may connect to the Club to enter non-winning instant tickets in Play It Again drawings and other second-chance promotions, Smith said. They can also enter eligible instant and terminal-generated tickets to earn Points for Prizes that are redeemable in the online store. The Arkansas Scholarship Lottery mobile app has been available for players since 2015. In 2009, Scientific Games and the Arkansas lottery launched the first lottery loyalty program in the U.S., according to Scientific Games International. The company said the lottery's loyalty program is one of the most successful in the industry with more than 101.5 million tickets entered into the program since its inception, and the program has awarded more than 1.2 billion points to players to redeem Points for Prizes in Scientific Games' online store. Lottery Director Eric Hagler said the lottery had worked on the new app for about a year before launching it two months ago. He noted that lottery players "will still not be able to purchase tickets through the mobile app at this time." In March 2020, the lottery started a pilot program with Jackpocket Inc. to offer sales of lottery games through a mobile app, but a physical ticket generated from a licensed lottery retailer is required, according to the lottery. Only draw tickets may be purchased through Jackpocket, but Winners Corner in Little Rock is Jackpocket's licensed retailer, and the store sells instant tickets on site, said Scott Hardin, a spokesperson for the state Department of Finance and Administration. In its strategic plan developed last year for the following five years, the Arkansas Scholarship Lottery says it will be necessary for the Arkansas General Assembly to strongly consider authorizing the lottery to launch an iLottery digital platform to sell tickets to remain competitive and current with consumer demand. In this year's regular session, legislation hasn't been introduced to authorize an iLottery digital platform. The lottery is currently authorized to distribute lottery games through a single distribution channel of brick-and-mortar retail establishments, the lottery said in its strategic plan, in what its management identified as one of four material weaknesses. Hagler said in December that the lottery is prepared for any contingency. "If there is no desire for iLottery, then we have a forward path in the mono-channel," he said in a written statement at that time. "If iLottery is authorized, then we will execute on that mandate, as well." The lottery's major term contracts expire in calendar year 2026, Hagler said. "If iLottery is desired, the ideal timing would be to align the launch with the implementation of new term contracts in 2026," he said in December. "This would mean that Lottery would need approval in 2025 in order to prepare for launch sometime in [calendar year] 2026-2027." Hardin said Friday that "Regarding iLottery, Lottery's position hasn't changed since late 2022." The lottery started selling tickets on Sept. 28, 2009. It has helped finance Arkansas Academic Challenge Scholarships for more than 30,000 students during 11 of the past dozen fiscal years.

         TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. -- Canada has pledged a significant increase in spending to improve water quality in the Great Lakes following Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's meeting with President Joe Biden, whose administration also has boosted funding for the shared waters. Following their discussion Friday in Ottawa, Trudeau said his government would spend about $306 million over the next decade on the lakes, still suffering from 20th century industrial pollution and newer challenges such as climate change, forever chemicals and microplastics. The announcement came weeks after U.S. Congress members prodded Biden to seek more support for the lakes from Canada, which critics have accused of doing too little. "The Great Lakes are a source of drinking water for 40 million people, and this shared resource needs to be protected," Trudeau said. "This is why Canada will make a major new investment ... to continue safeguarding the Great Lakes for generations to come." The Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River are the world's largest surface freshwater system, providing drinking water for some 40 million people and supporting a regional economy in eight U.S. states and two Canadian provinces. Trudeau's father, then-Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, signed an agreement with President Richard Nixon in 1972 to restore and protect the lakes. It has been updated several times since. In addition to toxic residues in harbors and river mouths, the lakes are ravaged by invasive species such as quagga mussels, loss of nearshore fish and wildlife habitat, and farm and urban runoff that fuels harmful algae blooms. The U.S. Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, started by then-President Barack Obama in 2010, has pumped some $4 billion into projects aimed at fixing those problems, with annual spending averaging between $300 million to $400 million. Congress has authorized $425 million for fiscal year 2024. An additional $1 billion from Biden's bipartisan infrastructure law will be devoted largely to completing work on longstanding industrial site cleanups. Canada, meanwhile, had committed $33 million to cleanup efforts between 2017-22. In a March 8 letter, nine U.S. House members urged Biden to "emphasize the importance of our binational institutions and investments for the Great Lakes from the Canadian government" during his visit. Trudeau's pledge Friday drew praise from those who had pushed for a bigger Canadian contribution. "This increased funding commitment to help preserve and strengthen the Great Lakes is a welcomed announcement from our neighbors in Canada," said Rep. Bill Huizenga, R-Mich. Rep. Brian Higgins, D-N.Y., said the lakes "are a resource both nations share, and it is incumbent on us all to invest in its health and future." A University of Michigan analysis has found that each dollar spent under the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative generated $3.35 across the region and more in some areas. Canada's promised increase is "a significant step towards ensuring the longterm health and sustainability of our freshwater resources," said Gino Moretti, Mayor of Saint-Anicet in Quebec and Vice-Chair of the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Cities Initiative, which represents waterfront cities in the region.

         LOS ANGELES -- The Los Angeles Unified School District and union leaders said Friday that they reached a deal on pay raises for bus drivers, custodians and other support staff after a three-day strike that shut down the nation's second-largest school system. The deal includes a series of retroactive raises going back to 2021 as well as pay bumps in July, as well as January 2024, that will collectively hike worker pay by about 30%, said Max Arias, executive director of Service Employees International Union Local 99. The deal also sets the district's minimum wage at $22.52; provides a one-time $1,000 raise for any worker who was employed in 2020 in appreciation of their work during the covid-19 pandemic; and creates a $3 million educational and professional development fund for union members, district Superintendent Alberto Carvalho said at a news conference. Free health care will be provided for any employee working at least four hours a day and their families, he added. "This agreement's going to make a lot of superintendents very nervous," he said. "That's a good thing." The deal "elevates the dignity, the humanity of our workforce, respects the needs of our students, but also guarantees the fiscal viability of our district for years to come," Carvalho said. He announced the deal alongside Arias and Mayor Karen Bass. Both sides credited Bass, who took office in December, with helping reach the agreement. She has no authority over the schools but she does have a grandson in the district. The deal must still be voted on by the school board and the full union, which represents about 30,000 workers also including cafeteria employees, special education assistants and other support staff. However, it gives them most if not all of what they demanded and is expected to pass handily. Those workers walked off the job Tuesday through Thursday amid stalled talks, and classes for some 500,000 students resumed Friday. Members of United Teachers Los Angeles, the union representing 35,000 educators, counselors and other staff, joined the picket lines in solidarity, lending muscle to the walkout. Teachers waged a six-day strike in 2019 over pay and contract issues, but support staff didn't join and schools remained open. This time, Carvalho had warned parents that classrooms would close for safety reasons because both instructors and support staff were taking part. The strike ended up snarling schedules for many parents because schools had to find alternate ways to provide child care and the meals offered on campuses. The strike has highlighted the issue of underpaid workers who serve as the backbone of schools across the country. The union said district support staffers earn, on average, about $25,000 per year and many live in poverty or must work several jobs because of low pay or limited hours while struggling with inflation and the area's high cost of housing. Carvalho agreed that what he called indispensable workers were being underpaid. Arias noted that another contract must be negotiated next year but added: "There is no strike planned for the foreseeable future." Service Employees International Union members have been working without a contract since June 2020, while the contract for teachers expired in June 2022. The unions decided earlier this month to stop accepting extensions.  Print Headline: LA schools reach post-strike pay raise deal Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         BERLIN -- Voters in Berlin go to the polls today to decide on a proposal that would force the city government to drastically ramp up the German capital's climate goals. Critics warn it could come with a steep price tag. The referendum, which has attracted considerable financial support from U.S.-based philanthropists, calls for Berlin to become climate neutral by 2030. The target means that in less than eight years, the city would no longer be allowed to contribute further to global warming. An existing law sets the deadline for achieving that goal at 2045, which is also Germany's national target. The center-right Christian Democratic Union opposes the earlier target but would be bound to implement it if the referendum passes. Jessamine Davis, a spokesperson for the grassroots group that initiated the vote, said Berlin's current target isn't in line with the 2015 Paris climate accord, which aims to cap global warming at 2.7 Fahrenheit compared with the pre-industrial average. "This is a very ambitious target, we're clear about that. And it won't be easy," she said of the plan to cut almost all emissions by 2030. "But the climate crisis is an even bigger challenge." Davis pointed to the flood disaster in western Germany two years ago that killed more than 180 people and caused tens of billions of dollars in economic damage. Scientists say such disasters could become more likely as the planet warms. By contrast, redesigning Berlin's citywide heating network as one of the measures to become carbon neutral is estimated to cost $4.3 billion, she said. While surveys showed Berliners narrowly in favor of the proposal, enthusiasm was muted Saturday. A rally and concert at the Brandenburg Gate drew far fewer than the 35,000 people organizers hoped for. The referendum requires the support of at least 25% of the city's 2.4 million eligible voters to pass. To draw attention to the referendum, Davis' group has conducted a large-scale advertising campaign, helped by donations of almost $1.3 million. While about $162,000 came from crowdfunding, most of the biggest chunk -- over $430,000 -- came from German-American investors Albert Wenger and Susan Danziger. In emails to The Associated Press, Wenger said the U.S.-based couple had "a long history of supporting climate movements and making investments in innovative solutions to the climate crisis." "The Berlin ballot initiative demonstrates that citizens in a democratic process are demanding faster and stronger climate action," he said. "This is a replicable model for the rest of the world and could result in achieving climate neutrality by 2030 before major tipping points are crossed." Stefan Evers, a senior lawmaker for the Christian Democrats, said his party acknowledges the "historic challenge" of climate change and the impacts it is already having on Berlin and its 3.7 million inhabitants. The party has proposed increasing the budget for climate-related measures by 5 to 10 billion euros, but Evers said the investments required if the referendum passes would break the bank. Strong criticism of the plan has also come from newspapers owned by German media giant Axel Springer. Its biggest shareholder is American investment firm KKR, which has sizeable financial interests in the fossil fuel industry. In a statement, Axel Springer dismissed as "absurd" any suggestion that its publications could be influenced by the interests of its owners. "Economic interests or those of third parties don't play a role in the coverage by our media," it said. Davis said she's optimistic about the referendum's chances, "but what really counts now is that everybody goes to the polls."

         WASHINGTON -- With Republicans interested in curbing spending amid high inflation, Arkansas U.S. Rep. Steve Womack has questions about the budget proposal President Joe Biden unveiled earlier this month. The congressman from Rogers and other lawmakers questioned Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Office of Management and Budget Director Shalanda Young about the proposal during a House Appropriations Subcommittee meeting on Thursday. "I will not be able to support the level of spending included in the president's budget," Womack said during the hearing. "Our members are taking a hard look at the spending request line by line and will determine what level of funding can be appropriated that puts our fiscal house on a sustainable path." The budget plan includes steps to reduce the federal deficit by $2.9 trillion over the next 10 years. It also incorporates tax increases affecting the richest Americans and eliminating tax breaks from the 2017 tax law, as well as $2.6 trillion in new spending. House Republicans have yet to propose their own budget, but some members have suggested reducing spending to fiscal year 2022 levels. During Thursday's hearing, Republican lawmakers mentioned a February Congressional Budget Office report, in which analysts stated the federal deficit would increase by $20.2 trillion from 2024 to 2033 if spending patterns are not changed. Womack, chairman of the Financial Services and General Government Subcommittee, has expressed caution about making broad cuts -- noting the possible effects on defense programs -- but advised the Biden administration to reevaluate its proposal. An experienced appropriator, Womack has been a leader among Republicans regarding budgetary matters. He served as chairman of the House Budget Committee through 2018 and as the committee's ranking member from 2019 to 2021. "I have consistently advocated for solutions to chart a responsible way forward," Womack said. "We must change gears and get going in the right direction to help Americans get the relief they need." A repeated contention from Republicans regards inflation during the Biden administration. The year-to-date consumer price index reached 6% in January 2022 and a 6.6% peak last September. The Federal Reserve has attempted to combat inflation with interest rate increases, including a quarter-point rise last week. The Biden administration is optimistic inflation will decline; the White House forecasts in its budget the consumer price index will fall to 4.3% this year and further decrease to 2.4% in 2024 before stabilizing at 2.3%. The president and administration officials have credited the Inflation Reduction Act with saving Americans money. The sweeping legislation -- which Congress passed last year along party lines -- includes multiple provisions aimed at lower consumer costs, including an extension of health insurance subsidies and tax credits for installing energy-efficient technologies. Republicans, including Womack, have tied inflation to federal spending. "It is disappointing that the administration not only proposes higher spending, but also incorporates higher economic assumptions," Womack said. Yellen and Young rejected arguments connecting inflation to government spending, noting inflation is not a uniquely American issue, but a problem facing many countries. "What that tells us is that coming out of the pandemic, supply chain shortages had much more to do with inflationary pressures we see across the globe," Young said. Yellen, a former Federal Reserve chair, mentioned economic progress since the country hit a peak consumer price index, including reduced pressures on supply chains and stabilizing housing costs. "These factors are lowering it, and the administration has taken actions to bring down health care costs, to bring down energy prices, and to lower the costs that burden American families," she added. Womack questioned Yellen and Young about when the federal government will need to reduce federal spending, adding he "doesn't necessarily subscribe to that notion" that the United States should deal with high inflation alongside other countries. "We have some unique opportunities to control it ourselves, to include the federal budgets," he said. Young said the Biden administration shares Womack's concerns and that federal investments and programs are targeted at helping families by lowering certain costs. The budget director additionally expressed unease about the potential impact of spending cuts. "What happens to those families if those federal programs are pulled back so far that they hurt the very people that all of us want to help?" she asked. Intertwined in the spending debate is the issue of the debt ceiling, or the maximum amount of money the federal government can borrow. The federal government reached its limit in January, triggering the Treasury Department to execute "extraordinary measures" to prevent a default, which could happen between July and September if Congress fails to act. Some Republicans oppose raising the ceiling without spending cuts. Biden has refused to negotiate on raising the ceiling. Yellen has cautioned Congress about not raising the ceiling. The secretary reiterated her concerns Thursday, saying an increase is necessary for the federal government to cover outstanding costs. "It has nothing to do with future spending," she told Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md. "A failure by the government to pay the bills it's incurred is something that would be economically and financially catastrophic." Yellen issued an additional warning about making spending cuts if Congress fails to raise the debt ceiling, saying "we would be certain to have a recession or worse" in that situation.

         Members of the Little Rock Board of Directors are expected to take up a proposed ordinance next month to amend the city's financial reporting standards and update language in city code that is more than 20 years old. During a meeting Tuesday, city board members deferred consideration of the proposed ordinance. They are expected to consider the proposal again at their next regularly scheduled meeting on April 4. Members voted to modify their agenda Tuesday at the outset of the meeting to defer the financial reporting item and add two other items without discussion. City Director Lance Hines of Ward 5, who was absent from the meeting, had asked that consideration of the proposed ordinance be delayed because he wanted to be present, Hines confirmed when reached via email Friday. The Little Rock ordinance that laid out the current set of financial reporting standards in city code was adopted in December 2001. The proposed ordinance now before the city board would amend language regarding how a monthly financial report is to be provided to the city board, changing it from a fund balance report to budget comparison reports for budgeted funds. The draft measure also removes a requirement for a formal presentation by the city manager and the city's top finance officer when the monthly financial report is included as an agenda item at the first regular city board meeting after the report has been received. Language throughout the standards would be adjusted to refer to the city's chief financial officer where the standards previously mentioned the director of finance. Additionally, new language is meant to allow the format of reports to change as standards for governmental accounting are updated. "The format of all Monthly Financial Reports shall be in accordance with Governmental Accounting Standards and shall include Annual Budget, Year-to-Date Budget, actual, variance from Budget, and prior year for all budgeted funds," the proposed ordinance states. Mandates in city code that officials issue fund balance reports on a quarterly basis as well as semiannual financial reports have been removed, though officials still expect to deliver quarterly reports summarizing year-to-date finances to the city board. Consideration of the ordinance precedes the expected retirement of the city's Chief Financial Officer Sara Lenehan this summer. Lenehan, who has overseen the Little Rock Finance Department since 2008, disclosed in November that she planned to retire at the end of June.

         Earlier this month, Pulaski County sheriff's office deputies were dispatched to Pryer Lane in reference to a violation of a protection order. Deputies had information that a male suspect ran inside a residence. After several attempts to ask the man to surrender, the suspect fled to a wooded area behind a business where his vehicle was located. North Little Rock police officers assisted the sheriff's office and deployed drones with thermal capabilities and brought a K-9 unit in search of the suspect. With the help of the thermal drone images and K-9, the suspect surrendered without incident. The arrest made with the help of a drone on March 13 is just one example of how police agencies are using drones these days -- not just for large-scale events, but for almost every aspect of police work. A study by Bard College reported at least 1,578 state and local police, sheriff, fire and emergency services agencies in the U.S. have acquired drones. About 70% of "disclosed public safety agencies with drones work in law enforcement," the study found. Five states -- California, Texas, Illinois, Wisconsin and Florida -- have the greatest number of public safety agencies with drones, according to the study. The college says the actual numbers are likely much larger. Consumer drones became widely available in the early 2010s, but strict U.S. regulations around civilian drone use at first kept police agencies from using drones widely, with limited exceptions, such as Florida's Miami-Dade County in 2010, according to the Brookings Institute, a Washington, D.C. think tank. The prospect that police might use drones as well caused serious concern among privacy and civil liberties activists, and a number of municipalities preemptively banned police drones, until 2016, when the Federal Aviation Administration passed what's known as the "Part 107" rule, which opened up American airspace to non-hobby drone use, the Brookings Institute said. "Police drone use promptly exploded, with a record number of agencies acquiring their own drones in 2017," according to the Brookings Institute. The North Little Rock Police Department tracks down suspects with drones on a regular basis. Property checks, vehicle pursuits, high-risk traffic stops, missing person reports, barricaded suspects, suspects who run on foot, marathon races, railroad rescues and more are other uses of drones to solve cases. The department first began to use drones in 2008, with Chief Patrick Thessing leading the team. Now, they have eight licensed drone pilots and five on the team. Each pilot has two drones in their patrol vehicles, an Autel Robotics Evo ll Enterprise Dual and a smaller Autel Robotics Nano. The SWAT team has a larger Brinc Lemar drone for specialty missions. The Autel Robotics Evo ll has 8K video resolution, a 50-megapixel still camera and an eight-palette thermal capability. The different palettes include white hot and black hot which help pick up people against background areas. It also has a speaker on it for officers to announce their presence in emergencies. It can fly for up to 30 minutes on one battery charge. The Autel Robotics Nano has cages around the propellers to keep them from breaking when they bump into walls. It has a 48-megapixel camera that can fly for 20 to 25 minutes on one battery charge. The Brinc Lemar has a glass break capability to go through windows, a two-way communication system and a monitoring ability for up to 18 hours. If it turns upside down, it can flip itself and take off to fly. The Brinc Lemar is especially based for tactical teams and flies completely differently from other drones. Jon Fisher, a patrol sergeant and drone team leader said the team has monthly training to help with "eye-thumb coordination" and get pilots out of their comfort zone. Arkansas State Police and Sherwood Police Department have joined the department on training days to sharpen their skills. "We want to be that go-to resource for all the other agencies," he said. "State Police is great, we have wonderful relationships with them." Recently, the department has been getting reports of people flying their drones at night without a license, Fisher said. "The biggest thing I want to get out is if you're going to fly it, be trained on it," he said. "If you're gonna fly for any commercial purposes, if you're gonna fly for a buddy, they're gonna give you tickets to a ballgame, you gotta get certified. There are laws, there's an Arkansas State law about improper use of unmanned aircraft." Officer Rick Beaston has been with the department for 23 years and has over 400 flight hours as a drone pilot. Beaston said he had just flown out a drone on Tuesday night to a liquor store where someone was swearing at a clerk and pulled out a gun. "They were making contact just as I was getting in the area, so our biggest problem with flying is getting there on time," he said. "We have to get there too. So a lot of times in this line of work things are over in 30 seconds and it's just not enough time for us to get in the air. We can streamline it and from the time I stop to the time I go airborne can be less than a minute, but it's still I gotta get there just like they do." Officer Chris Abel said people who run on foot are the number one use for drones. "If they run on foot our thermal cameras are able to see people really well," he said. "I'd say that when we get people that run, especially if we can get a good perimeter and we know that they're in a wooded area or hiding in backyards, then instead of having officers have to go check every bush, we're able to locate them." Beaston said officers are also able to see if suspects have any weapons in their hands to prepare to de-escalate situations. Fisher added that it's "absolutely amazing" how officers can train their eyes through experience and exposure to pick out specific officers over the thermal cameras. The smaller Autel Nano drones have allowed officers to inspect buildings from the inside and declare them clear before entering. "Going forward, we're going to have more of an ability to read the entire thing without ever having an officer put in a dangerous situation," he said. Beaston agreed that drones will minimize the need for manpower and the department won't have to put as many officers in danger. "Just about any time we put a drone in the air, we can almost say it's a success because we fly for so many different things," Fisher said. "Nine times out of 10 if we have a bigger pursuit and the guy or gal or whoever bails on foot, we normally end up finding them. Sometimes it's a lengthy chase, but we will end up finding them and apprehending them for the most part." On SWAT team missions, Beaston said it's now more convenient to approach the scene from the bearcat vehicle with a drone in the air to see which side of the location to enter from. "We can see if somebody sneaks through the perimeter and what we call a squirter, and tries to run away," Fisher said. "I mean, it's just so many different things we can use it for and it's all for the safety of the public in the grand scheme of things." Abel mentioned that the government wants to stay away from the drone manufacturer Da-Jiang Innovations Sciences and Technologies or DJI, from China. Several U.S. Senators including Tom Cotton of Arkansas have introduced the Countering CCP Drones Act to add Chinese Communist Party affiliated drone company Da-Jiang Innovations to the Federal Communications Commission's Covered List. This list identifies telecommunication equipment that poses a threat to America's national security and bans it from U.S. communications infrastructure. Fisher said if the legislation goes through, all public safety departments will have until 2025 to phase out all DJI drones and stick to Autel or other companies. The team's next training is on April 20.  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         FAYETTEVILLE -- A bill that cleared the Arkansas House of Representatives this month would effectively undo Fayetteville's ban on the retail sale of pets, while a lawsuit over the ordinance is set for a jury trial in January. State Rep. David Ray, R-Maumelle, sponsored House Bill 1591, which would bar cities from preventing pet stores from acquiring or selling animals from kennels, catteries or dealers licensed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The bill passed the House 86-0, with six members voting present and eight not voting, on March 14 and was referred to the Senate City, County and Local Affairs Committee. Fayetteville's City Council in July voted 8-0 to ban the retail sale of cats and dogs, unless from or in cooperation with the city's animal shelter, another shelter or a nonprofit organization approved by the city's Animal Services Division. Animal Services staff and members of the public told the council pet stores often get animals from mass breeding facilities, commonly known as "puppy mills." Although mass breeders can be licensed by the Agriculture Department, they go largely unchecked, and animals are kept in deplorable conditions, the council heard. At the time, Petland had been granted a business license and was weeks away from opening its Fayetteville store southeast of Joyce Boulevard and Mall Avenue. Samantha and Ryan Boyle, owners of the Petland franchises in Fayetteville and Rogers, told the council their animals don't come from puppy mills and are well-documented. Petland filed a lawsuit against the city in August, and Benton County Circuit Judge Doug Schrantz issued a temporary restraining order still in effect prohibiting the city from enforcing the ordinance. In January, Schrantz declined to grant the city a motion for summary judgment in its favor that would have dismissed the case. Petland contended in its lawsuit the ordinance conflicts with two state laws. Schrantz agreed with that assertion, adding that "questions remain." The two state laws are the 1991 Arkansas Retail Pet Store Consumer Protection Act, also known as the Pet Store Act, and the Working Animal Protection Act of 2021. Ray's bill would "clarify the applicability" of the Pet Store Act. The law requires certain guarantees from retail pet stores to consumers who buy dogs and cats, according to the Arkansas Department of Health website. Breeding kennels and catteries are excluded from the act, as are animal shelters and incorporated humane societies. Retail pet stores are required to register with the Department of Health and to keep the registration current. In addition to prohibiting cities from regulating pet stores that acquire or sell animals from kennels, catteries or dealers, the bill also would nullify any city ordinance found to be in conflict with the act. George Rozzell, attorney for the Boyles, said they are monitoring the pending legislation and will reserve comment. The trial for the Petland lawsuit is scheduled for Jan. 17. Fayetteville City Attorney Kit Williams said his office will wait to see what happens with the pending legislation, then act accordingly. "They are the Legislature. If they pass laws that are constitutional, it's up to cities to obey the state law," he said. "We might not like it, but we're going to do it anyway." Williams contends the ordinance doesn't violate state law currently. In court filings, Williams said the Pet Store Act had no relevance to the ordinance because the law provides guarantees to consumers, rather than empowering any pet store to operate. He said the Working Animal Protection Act also had no bearing because the law only applies to animals used in commerce to perform a specific duty or function, not pets.

         Pam Simmons Setser was 9 years old in 1970 when she traveled with her parents from Mountain View to Washington, D.C., to perform as the Simmons Family Band at the Smithsonian Folklife Festival. Setser, now a grandmother of five, has been invited back to the annual free festival, which started in 1967 and runs from June 29-July 4 and July 6-9 on the National Mall. This year's edition, produced by the Smithsonian Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage, features artists, artisans and others from Arkansas, Oklahoma and Missouri in a program called The Ozarks: Faces and Facets of a Region. Along with Setser, others representing the Natural State include the Ozark Highballers, the Brockwell Gospel Music School, Sylamore Special, guitarist Kalyn Fay Barnoski and cellist Matt Magerkurth. Also scheduled to appear from Arkansas are herbalists, healers, textile artists, distillers and a muralist/sign painter. Setser, however, is the only Arkansan on the bill who was also part of the 1970 festival lineup. It was quite the adventure, she said last week. "Several went from our area and most of us had never been on an airplane before. I'd never been to a large city. We visited the memorials and we went to the Smithsonian Institution any time we could." She and her parents, Tommy and Jean, also got to meet some of their musical heroes like Doc and Merle Watson and Maybelle and Sara Carter. "I was 9, but I already knew who they were," Setser said. "It was quite an experience. I've never forgotten that trip." She started singing when she was 5 and performed with her parents until she was 21 and moved to Hot Springs to appear during the summers in a show called "The Country Music Story." She eventually left her career in music to start a family, but continued to play and perform. Her latest solo album, "Now," was released in 2021. She has also teamed up with Brad Apple to form the duo Apple & Setser; their self-titled album came out in 2022 and they have been nominated in the category of Acoustic Act of the Year at the 2023 Arkansas Country Music Awards. Setser, who plays guitar and dulcimer, has long been active in the Committee of One Hundred, a nonprofit group that, among other things, funds the Music Roots program in the Mountain View School District. "Music has always been a part of my life," she said. "Going to the [Folklife Festival] in 1970, I wouldn't have been there had it not been for music. Now, in 2023, it's the same deal. If it weren't for my music I wouldn't have this opportunity. ... Stone County and Mountain View are blessed with so much craftsmanship and so many talented musicians. To get to represent that is a real honor." email: sclancy@adgnewsroom.com  Print Headline: Musical adventure never ends Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         BENTONVILLE -- Luke McBride and his family -- his wife and two young children -- were visiting Bentonville Airport/Thaden Field on a recent afternoon during their spring break. "Obviously the kids love planes," McBride said. "The park right outside is spectacular. Also good food. The whole area is well taken care of." The McBrides of Springfield, Mo., also were planning to visit Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, had been to some local breweries and were planning to go on a few hikes. But the airport caught their attention. Just as Bentonville has grown, its airport -- which sits on 144 acres in the middle of town -- has evolved. The 22,000-square-foot Thaden Fieldhouse, which opened on the airport's northwest corner in 2018, is a hub of activity. It contains a restaurant, Louise, that offers a prime view of airplanes taking off and landing over adjacent Lake Bentonville. The fieldhouse also is home to a flight school, store, flying club and exhibit hangar. Kids can frolic on the playground just outside. Next to the fieldhouse is a circular apron where planes can pull up and drop off passengers. The airport is a combination of pilots and the community coming together, said Brian Baldwin, president of the Airport Advisory Board. And it has drawn some national attention. "Coolest airport in the country" was the headline for a story Flying magazine published about the airport last year. Business jets come in several times a day, but most of the traffic is small planes with people learning to fly or traveling with family, according to Chad Cox, executive director of Summit Aviation, the airport's fixed base operator. "We hope everyone sees this airport as a great destination," Cox said. "More and more people are finding out about how special it is." 'NOT JUST AN AIRPORT' The airport is unique because of the hard work and dedication of many people, and relationships created between private and public sectors, said Bill Burckart, a City Council member who served on the Airport Advisory Board from 2009 to 2017. "Our success and uniqueness did not happen by accident," Burckart said. "A long-term plan was developed to create an experience for our citizens and our customers. We wanted to create a destination, not just an airport. Once the goals and plan were in place, all the stakeholders and the city pulled in the same direction, and 'no' was not an option. You have to be intentional in every step you take." Baldwin, besides being Airport Advisory Board president, is also a pilot who has a hangar at the airport. City officials had a decision to make after a tornado in 2006 damaged the airport, he said. Baldwin said Bob McCaslin, the city's mayor from 2007 to 2018, told him there are two kinds of cities: those that have an airport and those that want one. "Under his leadership, he made it clear we do not want to be one that had one and let it get away from us," Baldwin said. Officials discussed the airport's role. "The vision we had was to grab the unique differences and expand on those," Baldwin said. The No. 1 goal was to make the airport more approachable. "You have to take that connotation that it's just for pilots and rich people and turn it around to where kids look at this and say, 'I want to be a pilot someday. I want to be a flight attendant someday. I want to work on airplanes someday. I want to be an air-traffic controller someday.'" The airport is just four miles from the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art. Local trails, restaurants and other amenities are also easily accessed from the airport, Baldwin said. "This is as close to downtown as you are going to get. So how do we serve that?" Baldwin said. "Understand we have a lot of airports around us," he said. Springdale, Fayetteville, Rogers, Siloam Springs, the Northwest Arkansas National Airport and "little Bentonville in the middle," he said. "We all have unique aspects to what we do. What we are trying to do is to accentuate and accelerate the unique elements that we have here." 'WE WANT YOU TO LOOK IN' Dave Powell of Rogers has a hangar and plane at the airport. His wife also has a plane, he said. Powell has been a pilot for 35 years. "The airport has taken a unique approach in that we are a community airport," he said. "There are no fences. We want you to look in. We want people to come have a hamburger and watch the planes take off. We want to reach out to the community and say this is your airport." General aviation has not seen much progress in terms of small airports. As the world has changed, many airports have become less inviting, Cox said. "For starters, we ensured the environment at the airport is inviting and then hire people who understand the mission," he said. "If people want to be at the airport, creating a vibrant flying community becomes an easier task. The amenities, from our retail area, which sells everything from fishing gear to pilot supplies and snacks, helps to make this a natural stop." Additionally, most of the fixed base staff are building careers in aviation, which provides a level of excitement and youth, he said. IMPROVEMENTS, ECONOMIC IMPACT An extension of the lighted asphalt runway by 500 feet to 5,000 feet was completed late last year. The longer runway allows for larger planes to land and take off. Funding came from Blue Crane, the real-estate arm of Runway Group, Griffin said. Runway Group is a holding company headquartered in Bentonville backed by Steuart and Tom Walton. Current projects include widening the runway by 10 feet to 75 feet. That project contract was just granted and will cost about $3.8 million, funded through federal and state grants, said Debbie Griffin, city director of administration. Griffin also is the airport manager. The city will develop the west side of the airport for hangars, which will be done in phases. "We received $400,000 in state grants to provide basic infrastructure for what we are calling the first 'neighborhood' to continue west-side development," Griffin said. "We have received over 15 statements of interest from developers/pilots who would like to build hangars. The first phase will include six hangars. We are targeting to begin the infrastructure improvements this summer and development to begin this fall." There are over 30 hangars that bring in $40,000 annually in hangar and ground leases, Griffin said. On a busy day, the airport can see up to 100 planes, but a typical day sees about 60 planes, she said. More hangar development is needed, Cox said. Baldwin agreed. "We have created a demand," he said. "You have people saying, 'I have a plane, and I want to move to Bentonville,' or 'I have a plane over here I want to move to Bentonville.'" Griffin said it is hard to determine the economic impact the airport has on the city. Because the airport doesn't have a tower, officials don't track all landings and takeoffs, but fuel purchases in January 2023, the last month available, totaled 18,835 gallons compared to 15,889 gallons in January 2022. Summit Aviation sold 319,455 gallons of jet fuel in 2022. The city receives 10 cents for every gallon sold, Griffin said. "With the work that has been done to make the Bentonville a destination airport, we see people fly in daily for business and pleasure," she said. "We know that with those visits come purchases in lodging, dining and shopping in our community." The airport makes money from fuel sales, hangar leases and other businesses at the airport like the restaurant in Thaden Fieldhouse and billable hours from the flight school. Summit Aviation also has a maintenance shop that stays busy, Baldwin said. OTHER FEATURES The airport also has a grass landing strip, a unique feature, and connects to back country recreational aviation through FlyOz, Griffin said. There is a series of grass landing strips throughout the Ozarks recreational pilots like to fly and Bentonville has become very popular, Griffin said. The strip is owned by the city and maintained by a nonprofit, Tailwinds, she said. Game Composites, an airplane manufacturer, is located on the southwest corner of the airport. Game Composites is privately owned and continues to expand, bringing high-quality technical jobs to Bentonville, Griffin said. "It is kind of cool to know that Bentonville is home to an aircraft manufacturer, and you will often see the planes being built flying above the city with a through-the-fence agreement with the city," Griffin said. Through-the-fence access agreements allow an aircraft to taxi from adjacent or nearby private property across the airport boundary through an established access point, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. Another investment being made in aeronautical studies impacts future careers and workforce in the aviation industry. The Bentonville School District's Ignite program launched its aviation course for high school students this school year. Classes meet at the airport. The flight school also has a record number of students as the popularity of learning to fly has grown substantially and recreational air activity has increased, Griffin said. The flight school has been around since 2006. Today, around 10,000 hours per year are instructed. There currently are 121 students spread across private, instrument, commercial and instructor certificates, Cox said. "We believe that Bentonville is an emerging hub for aviation," Cox said. "From vintage aircraft to cutting-edge technology, Thaden Field is a place for pilots and aviation enthusiasts to gather. I hope we are just scratching the surface of what Thaden can be as an access point for aviation experiences unmatched by its peers."

         100 years ago March 26, 1923 TEXARKANA -- A man said to be impersonating Harry Carey, movie actor, appeared in Texarkana Friday and is reported to have succeed in persuading a local merchant to cash a $20 check for him. As a means of convincing the merchant of his financial integrity, he exhibited a life insurance policy for $35,000, issued to Harry Carey at Little Rock a few days ago, and a receipt for the first premium of $500. Yesterday afternoon an agent of the American Surety Company was here looking for the man, who, it is said, has left a trail of worthless checks behind him at several cities, recently visited. 50 years ago March 26, 1973 An interesting development in public discussion of 55-square-mile annexation to the city of Little Rock has been the opposition voiced by some residents of College Station and Sweet Home, two communities situated to the southeast. In 1961 and 1966, the principal opposition to annexation proposals emanated from heavy suburban growth areas to the southwest ... but failure of a recent incorporation effort afforded evidence that majority sentiment in the area now favors annexation instead. 25 years ago March 26, 1998 The words "American crafts" may dust off memories of old country quilts, Hobby Lobby cross-stitch kits, or a handmade backyard birdhouse. Unlikely to come to mind are stunning ceramic teapots, intricate hand-blown glass and dazzling beaded baskets. But those are exactly the types of objects the Friends of Contemporary Crafts embrace and promote. The organization, a loosely formed booster group for Little Rock's Decorative Arts Museum, intends to enlighten Arkansans on the rich crafts culture thriving in the state and around the country. Among other activities, they invite four artists a year for special conversations. During the free, informal lectures, which are open to the public, craftsmen often discuss their influences and their backgrounds and show slides of their work. The Decorative Arts Museum is highlighting a number of in-state artists and their wares at the 24th Regional Craft Biennial, in which Arkansans created 20 of the 49 objects on display. The show continues through Sunday. 10 years ago March 26, 2013 ROGERS -- The Lane Hotel, once known as the "Palace of the Ozarks," has been vacant for years, but some residents think the building could become a hotel again. The hotel is at Second and Poplar streets. The building, which last housed a retirement facility, is owned by a New Jersey company and managed by BFG Management Co. The building has been on the market since 2005. The asking price is $1.99 million, said Craig Hull, the local real estate agent representing the owners. During a recent meeting on the city's Vision 2025 plan, city and community leaders agreed a boutique hotel would benefit the downtown district. A boutique hotel is a recent innovation, said Godwin-Charles Ogbeide, a hospitality expert at the University of Arkansas.

         Officer selection on panel mulled The chair of the Little Rock Municipal Airport Commission sought to revisit the selection of officers on the panel after a new member was appointed recently, records show. In an email to other commissioners on the morning of March 16 -- two days after the Little Rock Board of Directors confirmed Dr. Harold Betton to the Airport Commission -- Chair Jill Floyd wrote, "With the appointment of our 7th commissioner, I feel it only right that we revisit officer selection. Therefore, I am [providing] my intent to resign as chair. So that we do not have a vacancy, this resignation will become effective after a new chair has been elected." She added that in the event a new chair was not elected, "this resignation is automatically rescinded." During the Airport Commission meeting the same morning, commissioner John Rutledge Jr. said he had been advised of an officer's intent to resign, but did not name the person. Commissioners then entered executive session. When they returned, Floyd said no action had been taken. In addition to Floyd, officers currently serving for the 2023 calendar year are Stacy Hurst (vice chair/treasurer) and Bill Walker (secretary). They were selected at a February meeting. Betton replaced former commissioner Mark Camp, whose term expired at the end of last year. 89 ballistic vests for police get OK The Little Rock Board of Directors during a meeting on Tuesday approved the purchase of 89 ballistic vests for the Police Department at a cost of nearly $162,000, plus taxes and fees. The vendor is Teeco Safety. Board meeting materials said police ballistic vests purchased in bulk in 2016 have reached their safety expiration and need to be replaced. A federal grant program will underwrite $36,366 of the cost. The remainder will be funded by federal asset forfeiture money, meeting materials said. Chamber names diversity director The Little Rock Regional Chamber of Commerce has hired Teuana Smith as director of diversity initiatives and programming, according to a news release the chamber issued Monday. Smith previously worked for the Arkadelphia Regional Economic Development Alliance and Area Chamber of Commerce. "I am thrilled to be joining the Little Rock Regional Chamber as an advocate and problem-solving resource for minority businesses," she said in a statement included with the release. "It will be a great honor to serve the community with my background and passion for creating a more inclusive and diverse business community and culture." Smith is a graduate of Little Rock's J.A. Fair High School and Henderson State University. She is currently pursuing a master's degree in mass communications and public relations from the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, according to the chamber. Mountain bike trail pact OK'd Members of the Little Rock Board of Directors on Tuesday voted to authorize a contract for up to $287,375 with Affordable Trail Solutions LLC to develop mountain bike trails in Boyle Park. A resolution approved by the city board said Little Rock will be responsible for 20% of the total project cost, with additional funding provided by the Arkansas Department of Transportation's recreational trails program. Mountain bike improvements to Boyle Park were identified as a "key development" in a 2018 "Parks Soft Surface Trail Plan," according to meeting materials.

         The editor of The Oxford American will take a leave of absence through August to prepare for the publication of a book to be published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux. Danielle A. Jackson, who joined the magazine in 2020 as managing editor and became editor in 2021, wrote "Honey's Grill: Sex, Freedom, and Women of the Blues." The soon-to-be-published book explores the history of blues music and how the genre inspired a new era of sexuality and freedom for Black women, according to a news release from the magazine. The book will also focus on the often-overlooked legacies of women in blues music. Part of the title, Honey's Grill, stems from the stories of three generations of Jackson's family and centers on a Memphis juke joint owned by her grandmother. Allie Mariano, who joined the magazine as an assistant editor in June 2022, will serve as managing editor in Jackson's absence. Anna Venarchik will work at The Oxford American team as assistant editor during Jackson's leave.

         The Alexander Planning Commission will hold a public hearing on its final version of the city's proposed new Comprehensive Master Development Plan. The purpose of the hearing is to receive input from residents, business and property owners concerning the future growth of the city. If any comments during the public hearing warrant it, changes will be made to the Master Development Plan, according to Planning Commission Chairman Michael Huck in an announcement about the public hearing. The plan will eventually go to the Planning Commission, at a future meeting, to vote on a recommendation that the City Council adopt the plan, he said. The public hearing will be held during the Planning Commission's April meeting, which is scheduled for 6:30 p.m. April 11 in the courtroom at the Alexander Municipal Complex (City Hall), 15605 Alexander Road, in Alexander. Huck said the April 11 public hearing is one of several steps officials have taken to receive public input. In 2021, the city conducted a public survey, followed by two public meetings. "This version of the Plan is the culmination of that public input," Huck said. The plan will be used as a guide concerning residential and commercial growth in the City of Alexander, he said. The current Master Development Plan was adopted in 1982. A PDF version of the plan will be emailed to anyone who sends a request to alexanderpcchair@gmail.com.

         HOT SPRINGS -- The 19th annual Valley of the Vapors Independent Music Festival has come and gone on possibly the busiest weekend of the year for Hot Springs. Taking place March 17-19, the event was just another draw to the city as the annual World's Shortest St. Patrick's Day Parade, spring breaks and mountain bike racing on the Northwoods Trails all coincided to fill the streets of Hot Springs. Event organizers at Low Key Arts say that while the festival was a success, they are considering the possibility of moving it to another date next year. To ensure festivalgoers get to enjoy the springtime weather at Cedar Glades Park and to not compete with the parade, the group is looking to push it back a few weeks. "This arrangement has almost just become tradition," said Sonny Kay, executive director at Low Key Arts. "That VOV and the parade kind of go hand-in-hand. It worked when VOV was in town." Since relocating from their old building on Arbor Street, Low Key Arts has held the three-day event in Cedar Glades Park for the past three years. This leaves them at the mercy of the unpredictable Arkansas weather and puts them a little farther out of town. The music festival is billed as a stop for bands on their way to the South by Southwest Music Festival in Austin, Texas. On top of days worth of independent music, the festival also boasts art, vendors, food and workshops. "I would say arguably that the parade and VOV are two of the most iconic things in Hot Springs on the calendar," Kay said. "And for one to effectively compete with the other, or ineffectively as the case may be, seems unnecessary. So, the time might be coming for a change in that equation."

         Man in stolen car charged; gun found Little Rock police on Friday afternoon arrested a man who they say had a stolen vehicle and a gun that he is not legally allowed to own. John Harris, 42, of Little Rock was arrested about 1:15 p.m. on charges of possession of a firearm by certain persons and theft of property, according to an arrest report. The location of the arrest had been redacted from the report. According to the report, the arrest came after officers spotted a vehicle that matched the description of one that had been stolen and made contact with Harris, the driver. While talking to police, Harris dropped a pill bottle that belonged to the owner of the stolen vehicle, the report says. It says Harris also told officers there was a revolver under the driver's seat and that he is a convicted felon, meaning he cannot legally own a gun. Harris was being held in the Pulaski County jail Saturday night in lieu of a $10,000 bond, according to an online inmate roster.

         Two men were killed in crashes on Arkansas roads Friday afternoon and Saturday morning, according to preliminary fatality reports from the Arkansas State Police. Daniel Eskandarian, 22, of Beebe was killed in a single-car crash at 2:48 p.m. on Interstate 40 in Conway, according to a report. Eskandarian was driving east on I-40 in a 2016 Kia Soul, the report says. Near mile marker 134, the car went off the road to the left and slid sideways, beginning to overturn before hitting a tree, the report says. A trooper investigating the wreck reported that it was raining at the time. Bruno Sanchez IV, 46, of Pearcy was killed at 11:32 a.m. Saturday in a collision on Amity Road southwest of Hot Springs, according to a report. Sanchez was driving a 2004 BMW 330I west at a high speed when he collided with a 2012 Chevrolet Malibu that was turning onto Amity Road from Rush Fork Road, the report says. Sanchez's vehicle struck a tree on the south side of the road after the impact, the report says. The report does not indicate that anyone else was injured in the wreck. A trooper investigating the crash reported that the weather was clear and the road was dry at the time.

         Short-term rentals on council agenda A proposed ordinance regulating short-term rentals is on the agenda for the North Little Rock City Council on Monday. Whether it will be given a third and final reading, preceding a vote Monday, remained unknown Saturday. The proposal -- which would regulate numbers of occupants, parked vehicles and noise in the affected residential areas where short-term rentals would be authorized -- has been delayed in part because of Senate Bill 197 at the state Legislature. That proposed bill would essentially prohibit cities from establishing local laws that would specifically and strongly regulate, cap or prohibit short-term rentals. "A local government shall not regulate the operation of a short term rental marketplace," the proposed legislation states. Local ordinances -- either in place or proposed -- have been controversial in Hot Springs, Fayetteville and other cities, with some residents opposing short-term rentals in their residential neighborhoods and others -- mostly owners -- advocating for short-term rentals with limited requirements. The cities of North Little Rock and Little Rock, both of which view short-term rentals as a regulatory measure, tourism opportunity and revenue income in the form of permit fees and sales taxes, have put their proposed ordinances on hold while awaiting the outcome of Senate Bill 197. The North Little Rock City Council agenda is available at https://bit.ly/3njYiOj. The proposed short-term rental ordinance is available by clicking on O-23-09 under the first item of "Unfinished Business." Resolution to laud cheerleading team Arkansas' 94th General Assembly is about to honor the North Little Rock High School cheerleading team. Senate Resolution 37 would recognize the North Little Rock High School Charging Wildcats cheerleaders for winning the 2022 6A All-Girl State Cheerleading championship on Dec. 16, 2022, at the Hot Springs Convention Center in Hot Springs. The cheerleaders have won three consecutive 6A All-Girl State Cheerleading championships. Nationally, they placed 18th at the Universal Cheerleaders Association competition in Orlando, Fla., and, in 2023, placed fourth at the National Cheerleaders Association competition in Dallas. Cheerleaders cited in the resolution are Caroline Jolly, Julia French, Abby Schaefer, Anna Baggett, Tiyah Green, Abrielle Crump, Haley Jordan, Kylie Sartain, Aspen Frensley, McKenna Chism, Iyuana Jones, Kamryn Cottrell, Amaya Kindle, Revell Hogan, Emma Dill, Mallori Holloway, Avery Bilon and Tori Moody, as well as the head coach, Missy Sela. "I am so proud of these young ladies and to be their coach," Sela is quoted as saying in the resolution. "Being the three time state champs is not an easy feat. It takes a lot of hours of practice to get ready for competition season. They give it all they have, all while maintaining stellar grades. We endured the tragic loss of one of our members, Tori Moody, but this team came together and dedicated this season to her memory. I cannot say enough about their resilience." Moody died in October 2022, less than three months after her 18th birthday, of an apparent pulmonary embolism. Honors planned for Irma Hunter Brown Irma Hunter Brown -- who first moved to Arkansas to enroll at Shorter College in North Little Rock and later became the first Black woman elected to the Arkansas House of Representatives and the first Black woman elected to the Arkansas Senate -- is on a path to be honored by the state Legislature. Among the resolutions going through the standard legislative process is Senate Resolution 39, which honors her legacy. Brown, 84, a resident of Little Rock, was born in Tampa, Fla., and grew up in Forsythe, Ga. Brown moved to North Little Rock to attend Shorter College, according to the resolution and the Encyclopedia of Arkansas. She received her associate's degree in 1958 from Shorter College. Afterward, she continued her education at Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical and Normal College, now the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, where she graduated magna cum laude in 1960 with a double major in history and government and a minor in education. She taught in the Memphis public schools from 1961 to 1964 and the Washington, D.C., public schools from 1965 to 1969 before returning to Arkansas. Brown served in the Arkansas House of Representatives from 1981 to 1998 and in the Arkansas Senate from 2003 to 2008. She was a founder of the Arkansas Legislative Black Caucus, becoming its first chairperson, and a 2019 member of the Arkansas Black Hall of Fame. Brown is recognized by a plaque on the Arkansas Civil Rights Heritage Trail.  Print Headline: North Little Rock notebook Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.
