        More than 50 transgender rights advocates gathered in front of the Arkansas Capitol on Friday to protest a bill that aims to make it a crime for a person to knowingly remain in a bathroom of the opposite sex while a minor is present. Protesters sang, heard from speakers and demonstrated against Senate Bill 270, which some opponents have said would create the most extreme anti-transgender law in America if enacted. At one point, demonstrators placed pieces of toilet paper bearing photos of lawmakers in a wastebasket decorated as a toilet to express their opposition. "What do we do with transphobia?" asked Tien Estell, advocacy coordinator for Intransitive Arkansas, while leading a chant. "Flush it down," the crowd responded. The bill's sponsor, Sen. John Payton, R-Wilburn, has said the measure is needed to protect children. Payton told the Senate on Wednesday he considers the legislation to be a compromise and noted the measure would cover both "transgender" and "heterosexual" people. "The bottom line is this bill does not make it illegal for somebody to use the wrong bathroom if it does not match up with their sex unless there is a child present," he said. Sarah Everett, policy director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas, told demonstrators Friday that her organization would keep up their opposition to the bill. "We at the ACLU of Arkansas, with all of you, will do everything in our power to prevent this from becoming law and, if it does, to prevent it from taking effect," she said. "We're not going anywhere." Payton pulled his bill from the Senate floor Wednesday to address a drafting error. The legislation is scheduled to appear in the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday.

        Meteorologists confirmed on Friday that overnight damage to as many as 30 homes in Pike County was the result of a tornado.  According to a bulletin on the National Weather Service's website, Pike County officials reported 20 to 30 homes were damaged or destroyed. Multiple chicken houses were also destroyed and "numerous" trees were blown down. The National Weather Service in North Little Rock confirmed Friday afternoon that survey teams had determined that a tornado was responsible for the damage in Kirby. The service said in a social media post that the damage was consistent with a higher end EF-2 tornado. An EF-2 tornado is measured at having three second wind gusts between 111 to 135 mph. More details were expected to be released this afternoon.  Gallery: Storm damage in Arkansas 3.3.23 Volunteer firefighters and deputies rescued two people from a Miller County residence that collapsed from damage caused by a tornado that struck southwestern Arkansas on Thursday evening. The rescue workers got the two people out without injury, said Michael Godfrey, director of the Miller County Office of Emergency Management. The National Weather Service's North Little Rock office could confirm that a tornado struck Miller County sometime between 5:45 and 6:30 p.m., but could not provide further details Thursday, said Joe Goudsward, a senior forecaster with the service. "We've been pretty lucky," Godfrey said. He praised the work of the volunteer firefighters, who were clearing downed trees and tree debris from Tennessee Road east of Texarkana late Thursday and had extinguished a fire that started when a tree fell across power line on U.S. 237 south of Texarkana. A possible tornado also left minor damage in Grant and Dallas counties, officials said. In Grant County, the area that was put under a tornado warning around 12:45 a.m. started in southeast Leola and tracked northeast from there, said Randall Berry, emergency services coordinator. "We've been fortunate so far, but so far we've not had any reports of any damages," Berry said. "We've had a couple of trees down on roadways. All of those have been cleared except for one and we just got a report of that one. So we're working on that but we haven't had any reports of any major damage." Deputy Jordan Ables with the Dallas County sheriff's office said only minor damage happened there. It primarily involved power lines, gas lines and timber near the very small community of Cooney, located on Arkansas 229 between Leola and Garland. The National Weather Service in North Little Rock has dispatched survey teams to assess damage and confirm whether tornados did touch down. That information wasnt expected until late this afternoon. Shortly after 2 p.m. Friday, Entergy Arkansas reported about 1,300 customers without power. The highest number of outages were in Pulaski County, 246. Police in Hardy, about 115 miles north of Little Rock, asked residents along the Spring River to leave their homes because of flooding, while hail and strong winds were reported in Oklahoma. The storm hit Arkansas and Louisiana late Thursday night after it marched across Texas. More than 72,000 Texas customers and more than 42,000 in Louisiana remained without electricity Friday, according to PowerOutage.us. No deaths or injuries were reported in Texas and Louisiana after the storm slammed California earlier in the week with as much as 7 feet of snow.

        Over 1,000 students at Little Rock Central High School walked out in protest of Gov. Sarah Sanders LEARNS Act on Friday. This comes after students released a letter to the governor about her invocation of Central High history in her speeches and legislation. Over 1,500 students, alumni, parents and staff have signed the letter, which takes a stance against the bill. “By siphoning funds and resources away from public education and into the private sector, the ambition of our disadvantaged students and hardworking faculty will be stifled,” the letter stated. “Governor Sanders intent to imitate policies similar to those of Floridas anti-LGBTQ+ legislation will suppress the free expression of personality.” “School choice policies which will favor upper-class families would create unequal opportunities for lower-income students.” “Reforms that attack school coursework deemed too inappropriate for students will dramatically decrease their preparation to face real-world social issues.” Senate Bill 294, also known as the LEARNS Act, is the Republican governors education reform initiative, an omnibus bill that includes state funds that students could use to attend a private or home school and set a $50,000 minimum starting salary for teachers. LEARNS stands for Literacy, Empowerment, Accountability, Readiness, Networking and Safety. The bill also includes provisions against the “indoctrination” of students with Critical Race Theory that the bill describes as conflicting with the principle of equal protection under the law or encourages students to discriminate against someone based on characteristics protected by federal or state law. The bill passed the House on a 78 to 21 vote yesterday. The Senate will still need to vote to concur with the Houses amendment to the bill before the bill heads to the governor for her signature.  A post shared by LRCH Student Council (@lrchstuco)  At the protest on Friday, student council president Steve Abochale said the Young Leftist club at Central High contacted them about organizing a protest after reading Gov. Sanders bill. “I want to — not just to set an example about what to do — I want us to set an example about how to help,” he said. “I think Central High School is one of … We are kind of the example. I feel like if we do this, to bring awareness, not only will we bring awareness to the bill, we will also bring support from other public schools because this affects other public schools. Its not just us. Its the LRSD, this is such a big matter and if we can bring awareness to even just one school, then our job is done.” Abochale said if this bill “keeps up” then the state will “be regressing back to private school domination.” Abochales sister Mimi, who is also on the student council, said education is very important to her and she wanted to make a change. “The goal is to shed light on the hypocrisy of the Arkansas government,” she said. “The bill wants to cut teachers pay for their master's, they dont want to pay for their master's, and the cuts are just giving money to the more elitist institutions like private schools, while kids who choose to go to public school, theyre not getting the benefits that they deserve.” Abochale said Central “will not be quiet” and “will always fight for our school and freedom to teach.” Kimberly Crutchfield, a psychology, sociology, civics and economics teacher at Central High. said shes been fighting against the bill since it was made public. “Im supporting our kids, show their voice, show what they want their communities and their schools to look like in the future,” she said. Public education, Crutchfield said, is an equalizer to help people move out of the economic status they were born in. “If you dont have great public schools, you take away that option,” she said. “It also helps us come together, learn each others perspectives on life. It is a true democracy in action in the public school level. So I believe in public education, I believe in the kids being able to voice their opinions. I believe, in funding education, special ed, public ed, and I believe in the choice too, for kids to go to private school, parochial schools, or charter schools, that is their choice, but public education should be funded by public dollars and not the other entities.” Johan Gonzalez, a member of the Young Leftists club, said the LEARNS Act “attacks” fundamentals that minority groups stand for. “We do have a voice and were not afraid to use it, because its really important to stand up for what you believe,” he said. “And were really doing this to motivate other high schoolers to also take the same actions.” Gonzalez said the school plans to protest again next Wednesday at the State Capitol building after school around 4:30 p.m. The governor's office did not reply immediately to a request for comment.

        GREENVILLE, S.C. — Victaria Saxton has willingly played a supporting role in South Carolina's starting lineup, letting talented teammates like Aliyah Boston and Zia Cooke lead the way for the defending national champions. She got a starring spot against Arkansas at the Southeastern Conference tournament. Saxton scored 19 points and Boston had her 79th career double-double with 11 points and 10 rebounds as No. 1 South Carolina improved to 30-0 with a 93-66 victory on Friday. Saxton, whose started 97 of 98 games the past three seasons, loves her role, no matter how big or small. "I just do my job every game, do what I'm here to do," said Saxton, a fifth-year player who finished her best scoring performance this season and a point away from her career high. Saxton's been as vital for the Gamecocks as anyone, coach Dawn Staley said. "Probably the highest praise I can give a player is low maintenance and high performing," Staley said. "V's been with us five years now. ... No complaints, the best teammate, she is our mother hen." The Gamecocks, who've won 36 straight, took control early and used their talented, tall lineup to advance to the SEC semifinals Saturday where they'll play either Mississippi or Texas A&M. Arkansas (21-12) will now sweat things out until Selection Sunday on March 12, on bubble watch as one of the last four teams out according to the latest projections by ESPN.com. Staley thought the Razorbacks had done more than enough to make the field of 68. "I agree with her," Arkansas coach Mike Neighbors said. South Carolina won't have such worries, the last undefeated who reached 30 wins for the sixth time in the past nine seasons. The Gamecocks, who lead the country in rebounding margin, were at it again against the Razorbacks. South Carolina outrebounded Arkansas 74-17 in a 92-46 victory two months ago. The Gamecocks couldn't quite reach that same margin this time, but had a healthy control of things down low with 51 boards to Arkansas' 26. Kierra Fletcher added 12 points for the Gamecocks. Saxton hit eight of 10 shots in 20 minutes. Boston had a season-high five assists and tied her season best with four of South Carolina's eight blocks. Laeticia Amihere scored 16 points, all in the second half, as the Gamecocks poured it on. Kamilla Cardoso had 14 points and eight rebounds off the bench. The Gamecocks' defense bottled up Arkansas' leading scorer Erryn Barnum for a second time this year. She was 3 of 11 for 11 points in the January loss at South Carolina and was 2 of 13 for eight points in this one. Saylor Poffenberger had 22 points to lead Arkansas. BIG PICTURE Arkansas: It won't be a comfortable week or so for the Razorbacks, who have lost nine of their last 13 games after opening the season 17-3. Winning 21 games in the rugged SEC is an accomplishment, but will it be enough for Arkansas' third straight NCAA Tournament bid? South Carolina: The Gamecocks got a boost from its two less heralded starters in Saxton and Fletcher. Saxton was active down low as Arkansas concentrated on slowing SEC player of the year Aliyah Boston and Fletcher's scoring offset Zia Cooke's 1-of-10 showing from the floor. NEIGHBOR'S VIEW In Mike Neighbor's opinion, South Carolina is right there with some of the great undefeated championship programs UConn had the past decade. "I've been in it 23 years," he said. "You've got to put them in the conversation with the great UConn teams." KAMILLA'S RISE South Carolina's 6-foot-7 Kamilla Cardoso had her streak of five-games with double-figure rebounds ended with just eight against Arkansas. But the junior believes she's playing up to her potential after scoring 14 points. "I believe I've been more confident," said Cardoso, the ACC freshman and defensive player of the year in 2021. "I feel like my shots are all going in." UP NEXT Arkansas will wait out its NCAA Tournament selection. South Carolina will take on Mississippi or Texas A&M in the tournament semifinals Saturday.

        Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders' education overhaul passed the Arkansas House of Representatives on Thursday, sending the bill to the Senate for a concurring vote. Senate Bill 294, also known as the LEARNS Act, is the Republican governor's education reform initiative, an omnibus bill that includes state funds that students could use to attend a private or home school and a $14,000 raise in the minimum starting salary for teachers. The bill passed the House on a 78 to 21 vote. The Senate will still need to vote to concur with the House's amendment to the bill before the bill heads to the governor for her signature. "The Arkansas House made history today by passing my Arkansas LEARNS bill by an overwhelming majority," Sanders said in a statement. "I have my pen ready to sign the boldest, most far-reaching, most conservative education reforms in the country into law after the Senate passes this amended version early next week. These sweeping changes will address teachers' needs, defend parents' rights, and, most importantly, give our kids the quality education they deserve." Sanders first presented details of her education proposal during a news conference in early February, announcing that her reforms would come in an all-encompassing 144-page education package that would include everything from higher starting salaries for teachers to a ban on critical race theory being taught in schools. Thursday's vote was one of the final steps toward passage from the state Legislature, with the Senate likely approving the legislation early next week. Sanders has received criticism for not making the bill public until Feb. 20, which kicked off a week and a half of debate among lawmakers and activists alike who said they felt the legislation was being pushed through with little input from the public.   However, the bill's sponsor, Rep. Keith Brooks, R-Little Rock, said the LEARNS Act is just the start of the process of remaking a public education system that lags behind most in the nation. "This bill is not the end of our work, but it's the beginning of a transformation which makes a covenant with teachers, with families and, most of all, with students in our great land of opportunity," Brooks said. The most contested part of the bill is its voucher program, known as Education Freedom Accounts. The accounts will be phased in over three years beginning in the 2023-2024 school year, with students receiving 90% of the per-student foundation funding from the previous school year, which was $7,413 for the 2022-2023 school year. For more than 90 minutes, legislators took turns arguing for and against what they perceived was either a novel or deeply flawed approach toward improving public education in Arkansas. While Democrats have remained united against school vouchers, the bill prompted a difficult choice for some Republican lawmakers in the GOP-dominated General Assembly. As the most prominent Republican against the bill, Rep. Jim Wooten of Beebe said he felt like he was a "voice crying from the lion's den" by taking on his own party. In a 15-minute speech, Wooten told colleagues Thursday that by voting for the bill they were "diverting money away from public education." "Through this bill we have managed to insult, alienate, dislike, and show disdain for every single person in this state that has anything to do with public education," Wooten said. Wooten proposed legislation to require private schools that take public funds to be barred from having selective admissions, which was voted down in committee, and said he was responding to what he thought was unfair criticism of public schools in Arkansas. He said supporters of the bill often don't understand the broken families, poverty and drug addiction which public school districts often have to cope with. Private schools, unlike public schools, screen or turn away students, he said. "As I'm talking I want you to think about three or four things: poverty, social and societal problems we face -- drug use -- the deterioration of the family. Every single one of these are having [to] be to dealt with [by] our public schools, the ones that we have insulted and told them they're not doing the job." A three-term representative from Beebe, Wooten was one of only three Republicans to vote against the bill. He was joined by Reps. Hope Duke of Gravette and Julie Mayberry of Hensley. Rep. Ron McNair, R-Harrison, was the lone member to vote present. No Democrats voted in favor of the bill. Rep. Tara Shephard, D-Little Rock, said the LEARNS Act would lead to school closures, noting that schools closed within the Little Rock School District after the state took over direct administration. "So for those of you that's wanting to know what's possibly going to happen on the other side of this thing, I'm your example of what could happen. Schools are going to close, your communities will begin to suffer as a result of this," said Shephard, a former Little Rock School District board member. In contrast, the bill's supporters said vouchers were an end to the status quo of education in Arkansas, which supporters say has failed countless students with many reading below grade level. Rep. David Ray, R-Maumelle, likened school vouchers to a myriad of other government programs that can be used for expenditures at private institutions, such as Pell Grants, food stamps, Medicaid or federal housing vouchers. "What in the world is so terrible about parents getting to choose the school where their children attend and allowing the tax dollars to follow the student to that school?" Ray said. "Do we honestly think the politicians and the government are going to do a better job of allocating those resources than the parents will?" Rep. Carlton Wing, R-North Little Rock, said the bill was a part of American tradition that emphasizes "individual liberty," empowering parents to decide what is best for their children. "What I've heard from my constituents is we want more choices without some of the current limitations," said Rep. Rick McClure, R-Malvern. "And on that issue, they have spoken loudly, clearly and in large numbers." Other supporters said the bill's funding for literacy coaches and tutors, and higher salaries for teachers will facilitate a long-needed fundamental change that will drastically improve education within the state. The LEARNS Act will increase the state's minimum salary for teachers from $36,000 to $50,000 and give $2,000 raises for teachers making more than the new proposed minimum. Teachers also could receive up to $10,000 in bonuses for high test scores, or teaching in a geographical area or a subject matter in high demand. At $50,000 a year, Arkansas would rank behind only Washington, Hawaii, New Jersey and the District of Columbia in starting teacher pay, according to the National Education Association, the largest teachers union in the country. "This bill is a massive investment in public education, it is a massive investment in the teaching profession, but if money alone were going to solve our problems then our education problems would have been solved long ago, along with our healthcare problems, along with our crime problems, and all of the other problems that ail society," Ray said. According to an estimate from the state Department of Education, the LEARNS Act will cost $297 million in the first year, with $150 million being new spending. The Educational Freedom Accounts will cost $46.7 million in the first year and $97.5 million in the second year, according to the estimate. The voucher program will be phased in over three years, beginning with the 2023-2024 school year with students enrolled at F-rated schools; enrolled in kindergarten; who were or are in a foster care program; who have a disability; or who have an active-duty military parent receiving first priority. In the following school year, the program will extend to students enrolled in a D-rated school; who have a parent who is a military veteran; or who are children of first responders. By the 2025-2026 school year, every student who is eligible to enroll in a public school will be eligible for a voucher to attend a private or home school. PROCESS The Senate Education Committee is scheduled to take up the bill at its meeting Monday, where it is expected to approve the bill before the Senate takes up the bill for a concurring vote on the amendment. Brooks filed a six-page amendment to the bill last week that includes more privacy protections for school safety plans that lawmakers want to be confidential and technical corrections. While the bill would repeal the Fair Teacher Dismissal Act, a law that requires school districts to notify teachers of changes in their employment status before May 1 each year, Brooks' amendment includes language to give teachers "an opportunity for a hearing" before the school board before they can be fired. The Senate passed the LEARNS Act a week ago, with some pushback from Democrats and some Republicans arguing the process was rushed following a vote on the Senate floor just three days after it was introduced. House Minority Leader Tippi McCullough, D-Little Rock, a former English teacher, also criticized the bill for being drafted behind closed doors and without the input of many teachers and administrators. "I care more about helping teachers and students than I do about political affiliation, and many of you knew that when this bill was getting drafted," McCullough said. "But no one chose to reach out or work with me or anyone in our caucus." House Speaker Matthew Shepherd, R-El Dorado, said he did not feel like the process was rushed, citing the seven hours of testimony the House Education Committee heard on the bill Tuesday. "I don't know if the process is ever going to be something that everybody likes, but the fact is legislation in the Arkansas Legislature, due to time constraints and other things, it moves through pretty quickly," Shepherd said. OTHER COMMENTS Heritage Action for America, a policy group affiliated with the Washington D.C.-based think tank Heritage Foundation, praised Sanders' education bill. "For too long, American children have been forced into a one-size-fits-all education system," Janae Stracke, vice president of field operation for Heritage Action, said in a news release. "Now, Arkansas can return power to parents to make the educational choices they know are right for their kids." In contrast, Carol Fleming, president of the Arkansas Education Association, called for lawmakers to pause to take more input before passing the bill. "The voices of hundreds of educators, parents, disability advocates and others have been ignored by those who represent us," Fleming said in a news release Thursday. "Despite pleas to our legislators to slow down and answer questions about the negative impact this bill could have on our children, it continues its sprint through the [Capitol]."

         TEXARKANA, Ark. — Young women from 13 Arkansas public school districts took part in the "Girl Power to the Max" STEM event Wednesday at Ledwell. De Queen-Mena, South Central and Southwest Arkansas Education Cooperatives partnered with the manufacturing for the regional student competition to encourage female participation in technical construction. Twenty-one girls competed. The top three spots granted two first-place winners and a People's Choice Award winner. Kinlee Stivers, a junior at Horatio High School, won first place in computer numerical control, or CNC cutting. Foreman High School sophomore Mallory Abercrombie took first in CNC lasering. People's Choice went to Emily Lewis, a 10th-grader at Mount Ida High School. The winners received trophies provided by Boss Laser, cash awards and $500 tuition waivers from the University of Arkansas Hope-Texarkana. "It's really honestly shocking. I wasn't really expecting it. It means a lot," said Stivers, who built a Razorback bench. Abercrombie said her laser cutting was the fruit of sustained effort. "I'm really excited and proud of myself, because it did take a long time," she said. Lewis claimed People's Choice for a table she built. "I'm really surprised and glad that I got it, because it took a long time to make. In total, with no stopping, it took 72 hours," Lewis said. Ledwell's Community Outreach Director expressed how enthused she was to hold an event like this. "It's huge, and it's a great opportunity for women to get out in the real world and to see they really can do a job in this industry. I think right now at Ledwell, we have five to 10 women in the shops, and so we definitely want more of that," Sarah Carpenter said. The competition was open to any girl in grades 9 to 12 attending a public school within the trio of Arkansas Education Cooperatives invited to the contest. Participants could compete in CNC cutting and CNC lasering technology projects using advanced equipment in welding and power structural systems. The competition was designed to focus on exploring and perfecting skills in high-need, high-wage, high-demand nontraditional occupations, as well as fostering innovation. It served as an extension of what the cooperatives are doing in the classroom. "We had the opportunity to apply for grant funding through the (Arkansas Department of Education's) Division of Career and Technical Education in the way of innovation grant funding. We got together, submitted the application and were awarded $145,000, which we use to purchase equipment such as CNC plasma-cutting tables and CNC laser-cutting tables for districts in our cooperatives that did not have that equipment," said CTE Coordinator Stacey Southerland of the De Queen-Mena Educational Service Cooperative. The event started at De Queen-Mena with 10 girls participating. According to a survey by Southwest Arkansas Education Cooperative, this year's event reached over 125 girls in Southwest Arkansas. Before participating in the event, girls were surveyed and results showed 63% were not interested in pursuing manufacturing careers. After the competition at Ledwell, 74% said they would like to work in STEM or manufacturing-related careers.    Participants in the Girl Power to the Max STEM event pose on a trailer during the competition Wednesday, March 1, 2023, at Ledwell in Texarkana, Texas.

         Hot Springs has more than $40 million of unfunded capital needs and more than $7 million of federal pandemic relief funds. The Hot Springs Police Department made its pitch Tuesday for some of the latter, asking the Hot Springs Board of Directors to consider using the restricted balance in the city's American Rescue Plan Act allocation to purchase an armored vehicle for the SWAT team. The Lenco BearCat is the preeminent armored tactical rescue vehicle, Interim Police Chief Billy Hrvatin told the board. It would replace the 2002 Ford Excursion the SWAT team uses as its "jumpoff vehicle," Hrvatin said. "It has oversized running boards, so guys can offload off of it," he said. "It has no ballistic protection." Officers have been shot at or been at scenes where shots were fired four times in the last eight years, Hrvatin said. "Ballistic protection is a priority for us," he said, noting the SWAT team has responded to 64 critical incidents in the last five years. The $246,000 BearCat Hrvatin requested is built on a Ford F-350 chassis. Its armor is rated for a .50-caliber round. An armored fuel tank, blast-resistant door and top hatch are some of the other features. It can carry up to 12 officers. "It has a stand-alone AC unit in the back, which is very important for guys wearing 25 to 50 pounds of gear in the summertime," Hrvatin said. City Manager Bill Burrough told the board last summer the BearCat would replace the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected, or MRAP, vehicle the city purchased from the Department of Defense in 2014. The inability to find parts has made it difficult to maintain the military vehicle. Burrough told the board Tuesday the MRAP will remain in service. "The MRAP still has a lot of life in it, even though parts are hard to get," he said. Hrvatin said the smaller BearCat is easier to drive than the 50,000-pound MRAP. "It's very easy to operate," he told the board. "It's like driving a truck. It has 360-degree cameras that make it easy to see around you. It's not like driving the MRAP. That takes two people, because you need a navigator to help the driver see." The committee Burrough formed last year to prioritize the city's unfunded capital needs rated an armored recovery vehicle as the most urgent item. It's unclear how the committee determined its rankings. No minutes or attendance sheets were available, and no notices for its meetings were provided. The city clerk's office said none were required, explaining that the meetings weren't open to the public. According to information the city provided, the committee comprised six members of the public: Linda Franklin, Alan Spraggins, Karen Kitchens, Bruce Jones, Todd Green and Mary Curry. The city board will be the ultimate arbiter of how the projects are ranked. It's in the process of developing its own priority list. Hrvatin also requested a Draco Gas Delivery System for the BearCat's breaching arm. The forced air delivery system can put tear gas into a structure or vehicle. "It's initiated by remote," Hrvatin said. "It can put a lot of gas into a house very quickly." He said the ability to deploy gas remotely may have enabled a more expeditious resolution to the 11-hour standoff the SWAT team had at an East Grand Avenue trailer park in 2018. Gas deployed manually was unable to reach the suspect, who was shooting at officers from the back of the residence. "We had a gentleman in a house that would not come out," Hrvatin said. "We breached the front door, and he shot at us. At the time we had no remote delivery option for gas. We had to call the State Police. They brought their BearCat, which had a gas needle. They punched a hole in the wall and got him out of the house." Hrvatin said the remote delivery system costs $21,500. The 2019 police fund budget included $27,000 to equip the MRAP with a breaching arm and gas needle. The city said its ARPA restricted fund had a $1.4 million balance. Department of Treasury rules require ARPA funds to be committed by next year and spent by 2026. Earlier this month the board transferred the $6.74 million unrestricted ARPA balance to the general fund. The money reimbursed the general fund for salaries and benefits. The enabling resolution didn't specify the time period the reimbursement covered. Putting the money into the general fund satisfied the 2024 and 2026 spend-down deadlines. Last year, the city opted to put $10 million of its $11.37 million ARPA allocation into the unrestricted fund. Treasury rules allowed local governments to put up to $10 million into unrestricted accounts that can be used for government services that include road building and maintenance, health services, government administration, police, fire and other public safety services. The city said $3.26 million was spent from its unrestricted ARPA account last year. About half funded the upgrade of the police department's body-worn cameras and in-car video systems.

         A large, winged insect was plucked from the facade of a Walmart Neighborhood Market in east Fayetteville in 2012. Michael Skvarla, a graduate student in entomology at the University of Arkansas, said he didn't know what he had at the time. He went about his shopping with the bug between his fingers. He took it home, mounted it and forgot about it for almost a decade. Skvarla said he thought the insect was an antlion, but he was wrong. In 2020, while teaching a class via Zoom, Skvarla realized the insect from his private collection that the class was studying was a Polystoechotes punctata, also known as a giant lacewing. It was the first giant lacewing recorded in eastern North America in over 50 years -- and the first record of the species ever in Arkansas, Skvarla and J. Ray Fisher wrote in a recent paper for the Proceedings of the Entomological Society of Washington. "Giant lacewings are still extant in western North America in the Rockies and West Coast of the U.S. and Canada," Skvarla said in an email. "I'm not sure they're ever particularly common or abundant, but you can still find them there." After receiving masters and doctoral degrees in entomology from the university in Fayetteville, Skvarla is now director of Pennsylvania State University's Insect Identification Lab. Penn State sent out a news release about the journal article on Monday. Fisher lives in Rogers and also got his Ph.D. in entomology from the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville. He's a research entomologist for Mississippi State University who works remotely from the UA campus in Fayetteville. Fisher said the reference in the news release to the giant lacewing as a "Jurassic-era insect" is a bit of a stretch. He said it's one of about 60 species with an evolutionary lineage that can be traced back to a common ancestor that originated in the Jurassic. And "giant" is only in relation to other lacewings, which are smaller, he said. The specimen Skvarla found has a wingspan of about about 50 millimeters. Ashley Dowling, a UA professor who served as Skvarla's major adviser, said some media outlets had blown things out of proportion by going with "Jurassic insect" headlines. That made it sound like "some prehistoric giant insect" had been found at a Fayetteville Walmart, he said in an email. "In reality, these giant lacewings are common out west and this species used to be more common across the U.S.," wrote Dowling. "I don't think we're going to find folks camping out at Walmart this summer hunting for this insect, but I think some local naturalists will pay a little closer attention to any large lacewing-looking bugs they see." The find brings up the question of whether there is a relic population of giant lacewings in the Arkansas Ozarks. But the bug could have been a hitchhiker, said Fisher. "Most likely this specimen hitched a ride on someone's truck or something when they came from out west," said Fisher. "And it flies to a light at Walmart from the truck." Fisher said he has no official opinion on whether Skvarla's sample was a local lacewing or imported. "I lack an opinion because it's such a curious, fun question," he said. Fisher said efforts were made to take DNA samples from the insect to determine if it was closely, or more distantly, related to the giant lacewings out west. But the specimen was too old, so the effort was unsuccessful, he said. "There's only one way we're going determine it, and that's with more specimens," said Fisher. He said insect identification social media websites like inaturalist.org and bugguide.net have made it easier to track the existence of insects across the country. Giant lacewings were historically widespread across most of North America, but are now thought to be extirpated from eastern North America, with the last specimens collected in the 1950s, Skvarla and Fisher wrote in their paper. "Although the absence of P. punctata records could be due to a lack of collection effort or collected specimens being ignored or misidentified, it seems likely that they really are absent from much of their former range given their large size (50 mm wingspan), attraction to lights, and often considerable collecting effort and expertise concentrated around entomology teaching institutions and biodiversity hotspots such as the All Taxa Biodiversity Inventory in the Great Smokey Mountains," they wrote. "For example, the last specimen collected in Ithaca, New York around Cornell University was in 1890 and it seems unlikely that such a large, interesting insect would go unnoticed by generations of entomologists if it was still present in the area." There are no historic records of giant lacewings in Arkansas, including unidentified or unpublished specimens in the University of Arkansas Arthropod Museum, so the new specimen is the first record for the state, according to the paper. "It is also the first record of P. punctata east of the 100th west meridian since 1951 (Owosso, MI) and first in the Southeast since 1929 (Blood Mountain, GA)," they wrote. "The Ozark Mountains, and the Interior Highlands more generally, are a suspected biodiversity hotspot," according to Skvarla and Fisher. "Dozens of endemic species, including 68 species of insects, are known from Ozarks, and at least 58 species of plants and animals have highly disjunct populations with representatives in the region. However, it is understudied compared to regions of similar biodiversity, such as the Southern Appalachians. This combination makes the region an ideal place for a large, showy insect to hide undetected."  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        The BridgeWay mental-health hospital, admitting it had wronged a 14-year-old patient who was raped by one of its workers, was ordered Thursday to pay her $2.5 million by a Pulaski County jury following a three-day trial before Circuit Judge Herb Wright. The victim is now 19, and the money will go into a trust fund overseen by a guardian and established to pay for her ongoing treatment, care and counseling. Her attorneys had asked for about 10 times that amount, $25.2 million, with $2.2 million -- representing about 10 years of mental health counseling and alcohol abuse services they say she needs -- going to compensate her for pain and suffering, mental anguish and costs of her care and treatment. They said jurors should make BridgeWay pay $23 million more to punish the North Little Rock hospital for what happened to her. The woman's lawyer, Katresa Riffel of Oklahoma, told jurors the behavioral-health facility was negligent for hiring her attacker, labeling as "unexplainable" the hiring of a man BridgeWay administrators, among them its then-CEO Jason Miller, knew was on the state's Child Maltreatment Central Registry over accusations he'd molested a child at another hospital. "If [he's] on the registry, why hire him?" she asked the six men and six women on the panel. "That should have been the end of this right here. The purpose of the registry is to avoid this entire situation." The registry is a secret list maintained by the state Department of Human Services as an inventory of suspected child abusers and used to prevent them from adopting or fostering children as well as restricting or limiting their opportunities for employment at schools, day care centers, hospitals and nursing homes. Riffel said BridgeWay administrators then compounded that mistake by the way they treated the teen after discovering what had happened to her, subjecting her to an inquiry by senior staff that left the woman feeling "dirty and ashamed." The teen had come to BridgeWay at a "pivotal moment" in a life marked by drug addiction encouraged by her mother, alcohol abuse enabled by her father and repeated sexual abuse by her stepfather and stepbrother, Riffel said. She was trusting hospital leaders to provide her with a safe space and BridgeWay let her down, the attorney told jurors. The experience has left the teen terrified of further in-patient treatment efforts, impeding her progress, Riffel said. "BridgeWay took away her trust to get the help she needs," said Riffel, with co-counsel Darren Gibbs of Fayetteville. Riffel told jurors that BridgeWay lawyers had spent most of the three-day proceedings downplaying how seriously ill she was but that her crippling anxiety, depression, struggles with alcohol and trust issues would take years of specialized treatment and care before she could do something as simple as enrolling in college. Jurors were able to see the teen themselves when she spent about 13 minutes testifying about her experiences at the hospital and how she came to be there on Wednesday. "I felt very judged [by staff]," she said, describing how she'd been questioned about the attack. "I felt very judged. I felt they weren't asking to help me. They just wanted to know [details]." With the hospital admitting negligence, jurors only had to decide how much BridgeWay should pay. Arriving at the $2.5 million award after about a little more than an hour's deliberation, the jury declined to require punitive damages. Hospital lawyer Joseph Farchione of Colorado apologized for what happened to the girl but said the hospital should not be punished for the freak occurrence that allowed the worker to victimize her. "We did fail [her]," he said. "We did not fail her because we intended to. We have admitted we were negligent." Farchione, with co-counsel Ben Jackson and Cara Butler of Little Rock's Mitchell Williams Selig Gates and Woodyard firm, told jurors that BridgeWay needed to pay for what happened to her, asking them to order $750,000 in damages, enough money -- according to what her own lawyers had said -- to get her through special recovery programs her therapist had recommended, fund ongoing counseling and leave enough money to buy her a car and pay for college. But the hospital should not be punished for what was essentially a fluke, a man hired to care for only adult patients was accidentally allowed one-time access to children, he said. When he came to the BridgeWay, the man had no criminal convictions, had never been arrested while the incident that put him on the Maltreatment Registry had occurred 11 years earlier, Farchione said. Considerable thought was given to the man's hiring, the lawyer said, telling jurors that a hospital in the business of creating second chances for its patients sometimes is called on to provide second chances for its workers. Farchione said BridgeWay did all of the right things once administrators learned the girl had been attacked, limiting access by male workers to children's wards, implementing a no-hire policy for anyone on the Maltreatment Registry, increasing video surveillance for child patients and redesigning the children's area to allow better observation of their rooms. "We learned that with the best of judgment, the best of intentions, things can go wrong," he said. Farchione also defended BridgeWay's efforts to investigate the attack, telling jurors administrators took all cautious and compassionate steps to support her, noting that she had been reluctant to disclose what had happened. The teen did not come forward. Hospital staff first heard from other child patients that she'd been kissed by a worker, and she first said she had been kissed by the worker who had also touched her buttocks. The next day, she confided more fully in a trusted attendant that she had been raped. An investigation by North Little Rock police did not result in charges against the man, 45-year-old Anthony Bernard Monk of Maumelle. Lawyers on both sides called Monk a rapist during the proceedings. He was named as a co-defendant with BridgeWay in the lawsuit but did not respond to the litigation, resulting in the judge ruling that he had committed civil assault and battery on the teen, with jurors ordering Monk to pay $4 million, $2.5 million in compensatory damages and $1.5 million in punitive damages. According to court records and trial testimony, Monk was hired as a mental-health associate in October 2016 and worked there full time until April 2017 when he switched to "per diem" status, meaning he was called in as needed to fill various positions at the hospital. He was generally considered a reliable worker, although his 90-day probationary employment status was doubled due to some issues. He was still on probation when he switched to the per diem status. He is accused of raping the girl while she was alone in her room over the Independence Day weekend while her roommate was on leave. Her guardian filed the suit against Monk and BridgeWay in June 2018. Court records further show that Monk was a residential assistant caretaker and a behavioral instructor at the Methodist Behavioral Hospital in Maumelle overseeing child patients in April 2005 when he was accused of molesting two girls, ages 16 and 14, with a confidential investigation by authorities ultimately determining he had sexually abused the older one, resulting in his placement on the Maltreatment Registry in May 2006. A third girl who had accused him withdrew her accusations. The 16-year-old girl's family sued in circuit court the hospital, Monk and others involved in her care in 2006 with the litigation ending in a confidential out-of-court settlement in May 2009, court filings show.

        An Arkansas Senate committee on Thursday advanced a bill that would require sponsors of proposed ballot measures to collect sufficient signatures of registered voters from at least 50 counties, up from the current requirement of 15 counties, to qualify their measures for the ballot. In a 5-2 vote, the Senate State Agencies and Governmental Affairs sent House Bill 1419 by Rep. Kendon Underwood, R-Cave Springs, to the 35-member Senate. Supporters of the bill said it would require sponsors of proposed ballot measures to get more statewide and rural support for the measures to qualify for the ballot, while opponents said it would violate the Arkansas Constitution and make it more difficult to get proposed ballot measures on the ballot. Sponsors of proposed initiated acts are required to obtain the signatures of Arkansas registered voters equal to at least 8% of the votes cast in the last gubernatorial election to qualify their proposals for the ballot. Sponsors of proposed constitutional amendments are required to obtain the signatures of Arkansas registered voters equal to at least 10% of the votes cast in the last gubernatorial election to qualify their proposal for the ballot. HB1419 would require the sponsors of proposed ballot measures to collect sufficient signatures of registered voters from at least 50 counties rather than the current requirement of at least 15 counties. The number of signatures of registered voters required from these 50 counties would be one half of the designated percentage of registered voters who cast ballots in the last gubernatorial election. Sen. Jim Dotson, R-Bentonville, told the Senate committee the Arkansas Constitution requires sponsors of ballot measures to turn in signatures of registered voters from at least 15 counties to qualify their measures for the ballot and "that's the floor." HB1419 would require sponsors to turn in signatures of registered voters from at least 50 counties "so we would have a broader representation of counties when citizens are collecting signatures and more rural counties throughout the state would be represented in that," he said. But Sen. Clarke Tucker, R-Little Rock, said he opposes the bill, and "I think this plainly violates the language of the state constitution." In 2019, the Legislature referred to voters a proposed constitutional amendment that would have increased the number of counties from which sponsors of proposed ballot measures would be required to collect signatures of registered voters from 15 to 45 to qualify their measures for the ballot, and "the people of Arkansas rejected that in November 2020 in the general election," he said. "This [bill] takes that constitutional amendment, which the people rejected, and takes it up five more counties," Tucker said. "Are we not just flouting the will of the people of Arkansas with this bill?" In response, Dotson said, "I don't believe so." That was only part of the proposed constitutional amendment that voters rejected in the 2020 general election, he said, and another part increased the vote threshold for state lawmakers to refer a proposed constitutional amendment to voters. The proposed constitutional amendment would have required a three-fifths vote of the House and the Senate -- up from the current simple majority vote -- to refer a proposed constitutional amendment to the ballot. The proposed constitutional amendment was Issue 3 on the 2020 general election ballot. That proposed constitutional amendment was much more encompassing than HB1419, which is "streamlined down," Dotson said. "I can't speak completely for what every voter was thinking when they read some language in a ballot proposal that sometimes ... maybe not be quite as clear as what was intended for it to be," he said. "They are two completely different proposals in my opinion." Misty Orpin, executive director of the nonprofit group Common Ground, told the committee that "I do believe that this is a constitutional change and therefore required to be referred to the people of Arkansas" for a vote. She said the Legislature has proposed constitutional amendments more than three times more often than what the people of Arkansas have over the past 20 years. "If you want to stop changing the constitution, stop trying to change the constitution because the majority of the changes are coming from this Legislature, and this bill does nothing to curb the ability of the Legislature to put constitutional amendments on the ballot," Orpin said. Sen. John Payton, R-Wilburn, said he supports HB1419. "I think when an initiative gets on the ballot, it needs to have overwhelming support of the public," he said. Tucker countered that "what this bill is about is saying we don't want the people to get issues on the ballot because we might not like what those issues are, so we want to maintain control, and that's what is happening here." Committee Chairman Sen. Blake Johnson, R-Corning, said "I appreciate this effort, and I want those folks whenever they are trying to amend our constitution to consider my counties in that because every one of them that I represent are small. "I know it is a lot easier to gather signatures in Pulaski County than it is in Clay County and other small counties like Randolph County," he said. "I would like my counties to be among those that are in the signature process." But Sen. Stephanie Flowers, D-Pine Bluff, said she opposes the bill because "I think it is wrong for us to just usurp the power of the people." On Feb. 22, the House of Representatives voted 79-19 to approve Underwood's HB1419 and send it to the Senate for further action. A similar bill -- Senate Bill 260 by Dotson -- cleared the Senate State Agencies and Governmental Affairs Committee on Feb. 16. Like HB1419, SB260, would increase the number of counties from which groups would have to collect signatures from to at least 15 to at least 50. Dotson's bill differs from Underwood's legislation in that it would also increase the required number of signatures from these counties from one-half to three-fourths of the designated percentage of registered voters who cast ballots in the previous gubernatorial election.

        The Fayetteville, Springdale, Siloam Springs and Pea Ridge school districts will see school board races this spring. Several dozen school board seats are up for election May 9 across Northwest Arkansas and the River Valley. The filing period began Feb. 22 and ended Wednesday. In Fayetteville, one board spot is on the line. Heather Clouse is challenging incumbent Keaton Smith for an at-large position. Smith won his first term in 2018. In Springdale, incumbent Michelle Cook is seeking a third term, but Donald Tippett is challenging her for her at-large seat. Cook has served since 2013. She ran unopposed in 2018 for her second term. The only other seat up for election in Springdale is in Zone 2, where incumbent Nick Emerson is running unopposed. He won his first term in 2018. The Rogers School Board's only seat up for election is in Zone 2. Curtis Clements, the incumbent, was the only person who filed to run for the seat. Clements has served on the board for 12 years, the longest of any of its seven members. The Rogers board just hired a new superintendent last year, and Clements said he wants to support him and the initiatives the board has identified. In Siloam Springs, Aric Bergthold and Gary Wheat are vying for the Zone 3 seat. Audra Farrell, who has held the spot since 2016, opted not to run for reelection. And in Pea Ridge Zone 1, Ryan Heckman is challenging incumbent Adam Yager. Yager was elected to the seat last year in a runoff election June 21. Heckman served on the board from 2015 to 2020. In Sebastian County, five school districts each have one seat up for election this spring; in each case, only the incumbent filed to run. The Fort Smith School District has no seats up for election this year. Crawford County has one seat coming open in each of three school districts, but only one person -- Terra Becker in Mountainburg -- filed to run for any of them. All election winners receive five-year terms, unless they are running to fill an unexpired term. Such situations exist when board members resign before their term runs out. All school board positions are unpaid and nonpartisan. Some seats represent specific zones within a district. Other seats are at-large and thus represent the entire district. Most Arkansas school districts hold board elections in May. Some choose November elections, in which case the filing period is in August. Bentonville typically holds a November vote, but that board has no seats up for election this year. Decatur has no candidate for Zone 1, a three-year term. In races in which nobody files, the school board appoints someone.

        HIGHFILL -- The city will spend more than $57,000 on air packs and related equipment for the Fire Department as part of a plan to replace aging air packs. During its Feb. 13 meeting, the council approved an expenditure of $57,697 for the purchase of six Scott X3 air packs, 12 Scott SCBA bottles and six Scott face masks for the department. The council approved the purchase of five new air packs in September 2022. According to information presented to the council by Fire Chief Cody Wynne, the department has 25 air packs that needed to be replaced, so more purchases will need to be made in the upcoming years. In other business, the council approved rezoning 4 acres of land located at 2753 W. Arkansas 12 from rural residential to commercial. The land is own by SK Land Holdings. The council also gave its approval to the final plat of Phase 2 of the Healing Springs Subdivision, land annexed in January. The developer told the council of work with the Arkansas Department of Transportation and the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission to swap land to create a public natural area for future trails in the area of the waterfalls on Little Osage Creek. The council considered a request from Police Chief Blake Webb to purchase a 2021 Dodge Charger with all-wheel drive and only 3,000 miles for $24,500. He said he requested the vehicle because the city needed a spare for use by part-time officers and as a backup should any of the city's aging truck fleet break down. Council member Toby Lester reminded Webb of his previous difficulties with using cars on the city's roads and said he did not support the idea of purchasing another Dodge Charger for use in the city. Webb said the car was not his first choice but that the waiting list is long to purchase a police truck or police vehicle and the car was being offered to the city at a bargain price from a dealer in Claremore, Okla. The council failed to pass a motion to commit to buying a truck when one became available by adding its name to a list to obtain one later in the year. A second motion to purchase the Dodge Charger passed only after Mayor Chris Holland somewhat reluctantly voted to allow the purchase. However, since an ordinance would be needed, the matter was to be brought back to the council at a special meeting for approval, but a decision was later made to lease a Chevy Tahoe and Silverado for the department instead. Discussion of projects Tim Mays of Engineering Services Inc. addressed the council, and discussion was held in regard to three different projects being worked on by the engineering firm: Relocation of water lines for the airport, surveying work on Douglas Cemetery Road for repairs caused by repeated flooding and the route of the sewer line to the Northwest Arkansas Conservation Authority water treatment plant. According to Mays, the city was approved to receive $2.7 million in American Rescue Plan Act funding for the $5.4 million project to run a sewer line to the Northwest Arkansas Conservation Authority plant for water treatment services. He said the city was very fortunate to receive the grant because many applied. The council discussed possible changes in that project to serve customers along Arkansas 264 and then running the sewer line south along Hendrix Road instead of running the line south along the Lick Branch Creek. It was pointed out that the design approved for grant funding was the design that followed the creek south and then used a lift station to pump the sewage to the Northwest Arkansas Conservation Authority plant. Mays estimated it would cost the city an additional $400,000 to follow a route along Arkansas 264 and then south. He said if the sewer system served customers in that area, an additional lift station would be required, adding another $350,000 for the lift station and the forced main. Mays suggested that, in lieu of modifying the entire route, if the city wished to provide service along Arkansas 264, the city put in a lift station and pump sewage to the new forced main for a cost of $400,000 rather than spending $750,000. He said he would hate to build large-diameter forced main where busy roads are because they are under pressure. Since the grant of $2.7 million is a 50/50 grant, the city applied for a $2.7 million loan from Arkansas Natural Resources Commission earlier in February, and that loan application would be on the Arkansas Natural Resources Commission agenda the second week of March. If the city wishes to extend the sewer line along Arkansas 264 to serve other customers, that could be another phase of the project and would require a separate loan application, Mays said. The matter of pursuing an additional phase and additional funding is expected to be on the March council meeting agenda. Tree city designation Scott VanHook, of the Arkansas Department of Agriculture, Forestry Division, addressed the council in regard to becoming a tree city and brought a sample ordinance that the city could adopt to become a tree city. Holland said he would like to strike out language authorizing the city to tell people what they can and can't do on their own lands before the city adopts an ordinance to become a tree city in Arkansas. To become a tree city, Highfill would need to create a tree advisory board and establish practices for the planting, care and removal of trees located on public property. The cost to the city is $2 per capita each year, but in-kind labor and services can be applied to this amount. A proposed ordinance will be prepared for consideration at the March meeting. Cassie Elliott addressed the council regarding the city's trail system and ways to tie into systems in neighboring municipalities and possibly obtaining Trail of Tears designations. Holland said planning a trail system would designate certain trails in the city that developers would build as they develop those lands in the city. Elliott said that having a plan in place could help with grant applications when grant funding for trails becomes available. In other business, the council: Approved an updated agreement with Centerton for animal control services Appointed Matthew Summit to fill a vacancy on the city's Planning Commission Adopted an amended budget for 2022. According to Holland, the amended budget did not add funding to the overall budget but simply adjusted budget line items to reflect expenditures and added funding from unused budget funds to the Police Department for the renovation of the city's new police station. Transferred $2,814 from the Highfill Water Revenue Fund to the city's Fire Equipment Fund.

         Dr. Brian Hyatt stepped down as chairman of the Arkansas State Medical Board Thursday in a special meeting following "credible allegations of fraud," noted in a letter from the state's office of Medicaid inspector general. Members of the board met remotely Thursday with only one item on the agenda: "Discussion of Arkansas State Board's leadership." The motion to approve Hyatt's request to step down as chairman and out of an executive role on the board was approved unanimously. Board members also decided that Dr. Rhys Branman will take over as the interim chairman until an election to fill the seat is held in April. According to the board Thursday, the vacant seats for vice chair and chair of the board will be voted on separate ballots in the April elections. The Medicaid letter states "red flags" were discovered in Hyatt's use of Medicaid claims and process of billing for medical services. In Arkansas, Medicaid fraud resulting in an overpayment over $2,500 is a felony. "Dr. Hyatt is a clear outlier, and his claims are so high they skew the averages on certain codes for the entire Medicaid program in Arkansas," the affidavit states. "The suspension is temporary and there's a right to appeal. I see only allegations and I don't see any actual charges and I haven't dealt with this a lot," said Branman. Hyatt has 30 days to appeal his suspension from the Medicaid program. Other information from the letter shows that Hyatt is alleged to have billed more Medicaid patients at the 99233 code than any other doctor billed for all of their Medicaid patients between January of 2019 and June 30, 2022. Another board member spoke Thursday, but did not identify himself, adding: "There's a process. He's going to go through the same process as everyone else and he's done the responsible thing of stepping aside as chair so that the board can continue to take care of the business we're supposed to without any distractions." Branman joined the discussion, asking Dr. Sylvia Simon how the board has handled instances like this in the past. "We get these [allegations] periodically that are issues with an insurance company, being thrown off of an insurance company or income tax evasion," Simon said. "Until they're convicted of a crime of some sort, we don't do anything with it except monitor the situation. If it's something that has resulted in arrest or could be a direct danger to patients like allegations of molesting patients in the office, substance abuse or things that would pose an immediate danger to patients or the public in general -- then you would consider something like an emergency order of suspension." Hyatt, a Rogers psychiatrist, was appointed to the board in 2019 by former Gov. Asa Hutchinson. Hyatt has not been charged with any crimes. The board said the investigation of Hyatt's allegations is ongoing and they will continue to monitor the situation.

         A House panel on Thursday deferred a vote on a bill intended to address the legal terms "consent" and "forcible compulsion" in sex offense cases. The House Judiciary Committee delayed its consideration of House Bill 1141 to allow officials to assemble reports on how the measure could impact state finances and criminal sentencing. Before postponing action, the panel heard from supporters who said defining consent is integral to addressing sex offenses. An opponent of the bill objected to language he considers unconstitutionally vague, and a lawmaker questioned if the measure would make it harder to prosecute cases. The bill's sponsor, Rep. Robin Lundstrum, R-Elm Springs, pointed to statistics on the prevalence of rape and said lawmakers could aid prosecutors and law enforcement officers by codifying a definition of consent. "We need to ask ourselves what is wrong and how can we fix this," she said. "It's not a reflection on prosecutors or law enforcement. They only work within the parameters we set as legislators." Joyce Short, chief executive officer of Consent Awareness Network, joined Lundstrum in presenting the bill, saying consent is a human right that must be included in law as a civil right. By defining consent, Short said the bill could help Arkansas raise its arrest rate for sexual offense crimes and save the lives of sexual assault victims who may attempt suicide. The bill defines "consent" as "freely given, knowledgeable, and informed agreement by a person who is not physically helpless, mentally defective, mentally incapacitated, or under the legal age to consent." Lundstrum's bill also would redefine "forcible compulsion," a term currently used in courts to determine if a sex offense occurred in a case. Under current law, "forcible compulsion" means "physical force or a threat, express or implied, of death or physical injury to or kidnapping of any person." The bill would expand the definition to include any "bodily impact, restraint, confinement, or threat of bodily impact, restraint, or confinement, whether express or implied" and any "other behavior that results in a sexual act against the will of the person upon whom the sexual act is committed." Rep. Jimmy Gazaway, R-Paragould, said he appreciated the intent of the bill but questioned if the measure could make it more difficult for prosecutors to try sex offense cases by broadening definitions in state code. Having tried rape cases as a prosecutor, Gazaway said he felt defense attorneys would use these extended definitions to their client's advantage. "The more definitions you introduce, the more words you give a defense attorney to play with, the more opportunity they have to pick it apart and argue to a jury that the prosecutor didn't meet this definition," he said. "My concern is that we do more harm by further defining these terms than we would without the definition." Short said the concept of consent "is absolutely germane in determining whether or not a person has been violated." By relying on the term "forcible compulsion," Short said the current law is not doing enough to protect against sex offenses that may not involve violence. Pointing to low arrest rates for sex offense cases, Short said there is "something very, very wrong with how the system itself is viewing whether or not a sexual assault took place." Gazaway said in his experience rape cases aren't always prosecuted because victims change their story or are pressured by others from pursuing a criminal case. In some cases, there may be evidence issues. "There's a number of reasons rape cases don't go forward, but it's not because we lack a definition of consent or we need to redefine forcible compulsion," he said. Prosecutor coordinator Bob McMahon said he was unaware of prosecutors losing sex offense cases because of a lack of definitions. McMahon said the Arkansas Prosecuting Attorneys Association had taken a neutral stance on the bill, which means attorneys may support parts of the bill while not supporting other sections. In a written statement provided by a spokesperson, Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin said, "We are neutral on the bill. However, we agree with prosecutors that it is unnecessary." Rep. Steve Unger, R-Springdale, asked if additional definitions would aid prosecutors in bringing sex offense charges in cases such as a highly-publicized incident where students in the Huntsville School District were accused of having assaulted other classmates. While he knew of the instance, McMahon said he was not familiar enough with the specifics to comment on how the bill might have affected it. Christine Munson told committee members she was a victim of sexual assault and rape and implored lawmakers to pass the bill. "Consent must be recognized," she said. Rep. Andrew Collins, D-Little Rock, raised concerns about how the bill could remove language from state law defining rape as occurring when a victim is drugged or rendered oblivious by intoxication. Short said that what made these cases rape was that the victim was unable to give their consent. Jeff Rosenzweig, with the Arkansas Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, opposed the bill, saying the definition included for "forcible compulsion" was vague and unconstitutional. He pointed specifically to the phrase "any other behavior." "This does not put anyone on notice for what conduct is prohibited," he said. Rosenzweig claimed the bill also would create a consent level that is so high it would "catch a lot of people you didn't mean to." Keith Lindley, a police officer, spoke in favor the bill, saying people accused of committing sexual assault often defend themselves by claiming their victims consented. "They're using language that we have yet to clearly define," he said. "That's why this bill is important." The bill includes provisions that would prevent consent from being used as a defense in cases involving incest. It also would bar consent as a defense in cases involving a school official who uses their position of trust or authority to engage in sexual contact with a student. A jailer who engages in sexual contact with a person in their custody who is not their spouse also would not be allowed to use consent as a defense.

        Fueled by a surge in sales and use tax collections, Arkansas' general revenue collections in February increased by $44 million, or 8.3%, over the same month a year ago to $572.4 million. Last month's general revenues beat the state's forecast by $58.3 million, or 11.3%, the state Department of Finance and Administration reported Wednesday in its monthly revenue forecast. February's total general revenue is the largest amount collected in any February, outdistancing the previous record of $528.5 million in February 2022, said Steve Wilkins, a tax analyst for the finance department. Asked what the February revenue report shows about the state of Arkansas' economy, the state's chief economic forecaster, John Shelnutt, said Wednesday "it shows we are not slowing down at this point and we can't attribute this kind of gain to just inflation or retained savings from the [federal] stimulus programs. "It's real growth in the economy that relates to what we are seeing in the labor markets," he said in an interview. Larry Walther, secretary for the finance department, said Wednesday that revenue growth was above expectations again in February and that demonstrates continued economic growth in Arkansas. "Additionally, tax refunds are on track with the forecast as we enter the busiest months for filing," he said in a written statement. The state's individual and corporate income tax filing deadlines are April 18, according to finance department spokesman Scott Hardin. Tax refunds and some special government expenditures are taken off the top of total general revenue collections, leaving a net amount that state agencies are allowed to spend up to the amount authorized by the state's Revenue Stabilization Act. The state's net tax revenue in February dropped by $4.6 million, or 1.1%, over the same month a year ago to $402.1 million and exceeded the state's Nov. 10 forecast by $55 million, or 16%. February is the eighth month of fiscal year 2023, which started July 1, 2022, and ends June 30. During the first eight months of fiscal 2023, the state's total general revenue increased by $318.2 million, or 6.1%, over the same period in fiscal 2022 to $5.5 billion and beat the state's forecast by $262.7 million, or 5%. So far in fiscal 2023, the state's net general revenue increased by $201.4 million, or 4.4%, over the same period in fiscal 2022 to $4.7 billion and outdistanced the state's forecast by 250.2 million, or 5.6%. In the fiscal session last spring, the General Assembly and then-Gov. Asa Hutchinson authorized a general revenue budget of $6.02 billion for fiscal 2023 -- up by $175.1 million from fiscal year 2022's general revenue budget, with most of the increases for public schools and human service programs. The finance department's Nov. 10 forecast projects a general revenue surplus of $598.1 million at the end of fiscal 2023. Shelnutt said Wednesday that "we are tracking above that by $250 million, so I am not prepared to put a new number out there [for a projected general revenue surplus], but it seems unlikely that we are going to burn through $250 million above forecast, given the provisions that we have for high refund claims coming up and a very low growth in sales tax over the remaining months." In the Aug. 9-11 special session, the Legislature and Hutchinson enacted a four-pronged tax cut package that the finance department projected would reduce state general revenue by $500.1 million in fiscal 2023, by $166.6 million more in fiscal 2024, by $69.5 million more in fiscal 2025, by $18.4 million more in fiscal 2026 and by $8.4 million more in fiscal 2027. The tax cut package accelerated the reduction of the state's top individual income tax rate from 5.5% to 4.9%, retroactive to Jan. 1, 2022, and accelerated the cut in the state's top corporate income tax rate from 5.9% to 5.3%, effective Jan. 1, 2023. The package also granted a temporary, nonrefundable income tax credit of $150 for individual taxpayers with net income up to $87,000 and of $300 for married taxpayers filing jointly with net income up to $174,0000, and adopts a federal depreciation schedule for businesses. The special session in August was held after the state reported accumulating a record general revenue surplus of $1.628 billion in fiscal 2022 that ended June 30, 2022. In fiscal 2021 that ended June 30, 2021, the state reported collecting a $945.7 million general revenue surplus. Prior to fiscal 2021, the state's largest general revenue surplus was $409.3 million in fiscal 2007, when Republican Mike Huckabee was governor for the first part of the fiscal year and Democrat Mike Beebe was governor for the second part of fiscal 2007. In November, Hutchinson proposed a $314 million increase in the state's general revenue budget to $6.33 billion in fiscal 2024, starting July 1, 2023, with $200 million of the increased general revenue earmarked for public schools to help boost teachers' salaries. At that time, he said his proposed budget for fiscal 2024 would represent a 5.2% increase over the current budget of $6.02 billion, leaving a projected general revenue surplus of $254.9 million at the end of fiscal year 2024. Considering inflation was more than 8% last year, limiting the growth of the state's general revenue budget to 5.2% reflects conservative budgeting in these challenging times, he said. During this year's regular session, legislative leaders and Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders haven't yet proposed a general revenue budget for fiscal 2024, which begins July 1, 2023, and ends June 30,2024. Today is the 54th day of the regular session. FEBRUARY'S COLLECTIONS According to the finance department, February's general revenue collections included: A $29.9 million, or 13.1%, increase in sales and use taxes over a year ago to $258.1 million, beating the state's forecast by $27 million, or 11.7%. Most major reporting sectors of sales tax displayed high growth over the same month a year ago, reflecting continuing economic expansion in many sectors. Sales tax collections in retail trade increased last month by 11.4% over the same month a year ago to $92.8 million, and sales tax collections from accommodation and food services, including restaurants, increased by 15.6% over the same month a year ago to $22.1 million. Major vehicle sales tax collections increased by 11.6% over a year ago to $28.9 million. A $2.1 million, or 0.8%, dip in individual income tax collections from a year ago to $262.7 million, exceeding the state's forecast by $13.9 million, or 5.6%. Individual withholding tax revenue is the largest category of individual income tax collections. Withholding tax revenue declined by $3 million, or 1.2%, compared to a year ago to $241.6 million, but exceeded the state's forecast by $5.6 million. The withholding tax revenue dipped because of the lower withholding rates tied to the recent tax reduction. Collections from returns and extensions increased by $0.8 million over a year ago to $15 million, which outdistanced the state's forecast by $6.1 million. Collections from estimated payments increased by $0.1 million from a year ago to $6.1 million, beating the state's forecast by $2.2 million. A $14.1 million, or 199.9%, increase in corporate income tax collections over a year ago to $21.1 million, exceeding the state's forecast by $15.6 million, or 284.2%. The increased collections reflect higher extension and return payments compared to a year ago.

        Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced Thursday that she will appoint Kevin Crass to the board of trustees of the University of Arkansas. Crass will replace Charles Gibson and his term will expire on March 1, 2033. Crass was executive director of Sanders' transition team. "He helped lay the foundation for my administration to hit the ground running on day one with bold, conservative reforms that empower all Arkansans," Sanders said in a news release. "I am confident that his strong leadership, character, and experience will make him an invaluable member of the Board of Trustees." When asked why he wanted to be on the UA board of trustees, Crass responded in an email, "I have served on War Memorial Stadium Commission, UALR Board of Visitors and UAMS Foundation Fund Board. In those roles, I interacted with UA officials and Board. I also serve on Ouachita Baptist University President's Advisory Council. "I have developed an interest in supporting higher education in our state," he continued. "My college and law school experiences provided me with an opportunity to follow my dream of being a lawyer. The challenges of higher education are enormous with downward pressures on enrollment and upward pressures on the cost. I look forward to working with the Board and the administration to address these challenges." Crass is a senior partner in the litigation practice group at Friday, Eldredge & Clark LLP in Little Rock. He focuses his practice on significant, complex business litigation in federal and state court, according to the release. Crass has extensive experience in handling the defense of national and state class actions in state and federal courts. "He also provides clients with representation before governmental bodies and counsels them in regulatory matters," according to the release. "Kevin has served as personal counsel to several of the state's constitutional officers." Alexa Henning, a spokeswoman for the governor's office, said Crass will represent Arkansas' 4th Congressional District. He is from Pine Bluff and lives in Little Rock, according to his Facebook page. Under Arkansas Code Annotated 6-64-201, the board of trustees of the University of Arkansas "shall consist" of 10 members. The governor appoints the trustees, who serve for a term of 10 years. Two board members "shall be appointed from" each of the state's four congressional districts, according to the state law. Two other board members shall be appointed from the state at large. And the two at-large members shall not reside in the same congressional district. The state law appears to have no residency requirement beyond the two at-large members not residing in the same congressional district. Crass played basketball in high school in Pine Bluff. His team won the state championship in 1977, with 30 wins and one loss, he told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette in a 2018 interview. Crass landed a basketball scholarship to Ouachita Baptist University in Arkadelphia, where he graduated in 1981. He earned a law degree from the University of Arkansas at Little Rock in 1984. Crass went to work in 1982 as a summer law clerk at the Friday firm and has remained with that firm ever since. He began going to UALR Trojan basketball games in 1981 and became a supporter of the team. According to the 2018 article in the Democrat-Gazette, Crass served as a personal attorney for former Gov. Mike Huckabee, who is Sanders' father. Mike Huckabee and Crass became friends, hunting together and spending time with their families, according to the article. "I think the world of Gov. Huckabee," Crass said in 2018 of Mike Huckabee. "I watched his children grow up and helped them some along the way when they had issues -- nothing serious." He noted the role of Huckabee's daughter, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who was then White House press secretary for President Donald Trump. "It's tough to watch her take the criticism that she's taking," Crass said in 2018. "I just think the world of Sarah -- I watched her grow up and I know her husband and they're just good folks. They're just in a high profile position with a very difficult president." "He's just a very humble, gracious but incredibly smart guy," Mike Huckabee said of Crass in 2018. "Kevin is one of those attorneys who tend to be understated in a lot of ways but he's always the one that people want to talk to. He's very thoughtful and deliberate when he's giving advice and it's easy to get all excited and become impetuous -- he's very unlike me in some of those respects which was very helpful." Crass' legal representation of Mike Huckabee led to Crass being retained as a lawyer for the Bush-Cheney campaign, according to the 2018 article. Because of his work on that national campaign, Crass was asked if there were any appointments he might be interested in. That's how he came to be appointed by President George W. Bush to the President's Advisory Committee on the Arts to the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, which he served on for several years. Crass worked as an intern for U.S. Rep. Kaneaster Hodges, D-Newport, the summer after his freshman year at Ouachita. "I don't think I'd ever even been on an airplane," Crass said in the 2018 interview. "I loaded up a bag and lived in Washington for a summer and it was just an eye-opening experience for me." Razorbacks standout U.S. Reed, who played basketball with Crass in Pine Bluff, remembered him as a team player. "If you watch the series Star Trek, you always have a logical one -- that was a Mr. Spock -- so he was our Mr. Spock on the basketball team," Reed told the Democrat-Gazette in 2018. "Our team had many talents but he was the one who would give us the big shots for the games and he was a real important person on our basketball team for how he thought things out. He was a real smart guy and he's smart today." Crass previously served on the board of the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals Bar Association. He also previously served on the Federal Practice Committee for the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas, having been appointed by the judges in that district. Crass and his wife, Cathy, endowed a scholarship at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville for students from Jefferson and Pulaski counties.

         The University of Central Arkansas will demolish Short/Denney Hall this year, following approval by the university's board of trustees during a teleconference meeting Thursday. Though the university has renovated several residence halls in recent years, the cost to do similar work on Short/Denney Hall would far exceed any of those other projects, making it more fiscally responsible to simply demolish the building, said Houston Davis, UCA's president. In fact, the cost to remediate and renovate the building would exceed the value of the structure. No students live in the building, although a few staff members use it for offices since they were relocated from McAlister Hall due to that building's renovation, said Kevin Carter, UCA's associate vice president for facilities. When those employees move out in early May, work can begin, and the project is expected to be completed in June. The university will perform asbestos abatement and demolition, with Housing and Plant funds used for the project, which is estimated to cost $803,130, according to the university. The three-story residence hall -- one of several dorms on campus -- had been designated for freshmen and "located near Christian Cafeteria and the Student Center, [featuring] double rooms, suite-style bathrooms, free on-site laundry facilities, and a fully furnished community kitchen area." Short/Denney Hall was constructed in the early 1960s, said Fredricka Sharkey, UCA director of media relations. The university has no plans at this time to build another residence hall. Also during Thursday's meeting, trustees approved construction of a new parking lot in Short/Denney Hall's location to better serve the Ronnie Williams Student Center and the Snow Fine Arts center. Anticipated completion is August for the $421,704 project, funded by Plant Funds. Not having parking to serve the Ronnie Williams Student Center and the Snow Fine Arts building has been "challenging," Davis said. The new parking lot is expected to have 80 spots, including some for those with disabilities. Trustees also approved adding a wheelchair ramp at McAlister Hall's south entrance and renovating its first-floor restrooms and lobbies. The $550,000 project, scheduled for December completion, will use Plant Funds and an Arkansas Natural and Cultural Resources Council grant, according to the university. Constructed in 1934, McAlister Hall is home to the Department of Art, the Department of Family and Consumer Sciences, and the Honors College. "We're very fortunate to get [this grant] to do this" project, Davis said. Finally, trustees approved Greek Village Room Rates for 2023-24 with no changes from the current year. The administration recommended continuing the current rates for Greek Village, designed for fraternities and sororities. Carlos Herrera, president of the Staff Senate, Courtney Clawson, president of the Student Government Association, and Kristin Dooley, president of the Faculty Senate, all gave their imprimatur to everything approved unanimously Thursday by the trustees. These moves "reinforce" ongoing efforts by the board of trustees and Davis to do "what is in the best interests" of both students and the university's finances, said Dooley.

         Little Rock police on Thursday afternoon arrested 13 students at Hall High School after a brawl sent another student to an area hospital with minor injuries, police said. Officers responded to a disturbance call at the school, located at 6700 H St., around 12:28 p.m. and found several fights in progress, a tweet from police stated. In addition to the injured student, some property was damaged. The ages and sexes of the students involved were not available, but police spokesman Mark Edwards said he thought the participants were a mix of males and females. He couldn't say for sure what led to the fight. The scuffle caused the school to go into a temporary lockdown Thursday afternoon, said Pamela Smith, Little Rock School District's communications director. Classes resumed after police and school security got the fighting under control, Smith said, but some students called their parents to come get them, and parents were permitted to pick up their students if they wanted. One arrested student faces a charge of inciting a riot, a felony, while the 12 others face misdemeanor disorderly conduct charges, the police tweet states. The students involved will be disciplined according to the law and the school district's student handbook, Smith said.

         On Thursday, the Arkansas Supreme Court affirmed a circuit court opinion that ruled a local attorney could not bring a firearm into the Pulaski County District Courthouse. After hearing the case in early February, the court ruled against Conway attorney Chris Corbitt, 52, who filed a lawsuit against Pulaski County after being turned away from the district courthouse in early January 2020. Writing the court opinion, Chief Justice John Dan Kemp said that Corbitt argued "that the circuit court abused its discretion by denying his petition for writ of mandamus because the plain language of Arkansas Code ... allows him to carry a firearm into a courthouse." Corbitt argued that the code in question, Arkansas Code 5-73-122, authorizes attorneys as "officers of the court" to carry a firearm in any court or courthouse in the state. The defendants in the case argued that it only permits officers of the court to possess a firearm in a courthouse when "authorized by the court." Kemp wrote that the circuit court found "Corbitt failed to show that he had a clear, legal right that had been denied. We agree with the circuit court's conclusion." Justices Rhonda Wood, Shawn Womack and Barbara Webb concurred with parts of the ruling and dissented to parts. When the case was argued before the Supreme Court last month, Corbitt had lawsuits filed against Saline County after being denied entry to the county courthouse while armed; against Arkansas State University over being denied admission with a gun to First National Bank Arena; against the city of Little Rock for being denied admission to City Hall while carrying a gun; and another lawsuit against Pulaski County naming Pulaski County Judge Barry Hyde and Sheriff Eric Higgins as well as Circuit Judge Tim Fox after he was denied entry to the Pulaski County Circuit Courthouse.

         SPRINGDALE -- AQ Chicken House plans to shut its doors this month after 7½ decades of business in Springdale. The restaurant's last day of business at 1207 N. Thompson St. will be March 18, according to manager Kaleesa Sanders. She said she didn't know anything else about the closing. Owner Dick Bradley said in December that there was a pending contract for a company to buy the property, but the company involved was "doing their due diligence" and hadn't yet accepted a deal. Bradley could not be reached Thursday for comment or confirmation of whether that deal has been completed. "This is certainly a sad day for anyone who's ever enjoyed the delicious pan fried chicken or battered fries AQ Chicken is known for," said Bill Rogers, president of the Springdale Chamber of Commerce, in a statement. "While we understand and respect why the AQ Chicken property has been sold, it doesn't mean we aren't already missing this restaurant that is beloved by so many across our state and around the nation." Roy Ritter opened AQ Chicken House in 1947. Ritter later became the mayor of Springdale, according to Angie Albright, director of the Shiloh Museum of Ozark History. The story of the restaurant and its founder represents the way "things all end up tied together" in a growing community like Springdale, from local businesses to city leadership to the poultry industry, Albright said. "I don't think iconic is too strong of a word," Albright said of the restaurant. In the beginning, when Thompson Avenue was still a dirt road, chickens were raised, killed, cleaned and processed right behind the restaurant, according to Kat Robinson's book "Classic Eateries of the Ozarks and Arkansas River Valley." The menu has served chicken in all forms over the years. Some of the signature dishes have included pan-fried chicken, often served with spaghetti, and the AQ Pickle O's, battered and fried dill pickle bites. The restaurant was sold to Frank Hickingbotham and Ron Palmer in 1981, Robinson writes. In 1998, Bradley sold his Lincoln chicken farm to buy the business. President Bill Clinton in 1993 celebrated his 47th birthday with pan-fried chicken at the restaurant and George W. Bush once ordered some AQ chicken from Air Force One, according to the restaurant's website. An AQ location at 1925 N. College Ave. in Fayetteville was open from 1991 to 2016. AQ Chicken Express used to operate next to that location at 1889 N. College Ave. AQ, which stands for Arkansas Quality, is one of a few U.S. 71 restaurants such as Herman's Ribhouse in Fayetteville and Neal's Cafe in Springdale that long predate the arrival of the interstate in Northwest Arkansas. Another such restaurant, Fred's Hickory Inn in Bentonville, was sold last year to new owners and has since been renamed. The Shiloh Museum of Ozark History has a number of items related to AQ in its collection, including menus and photos, according to Albright. The Ritter-McDonald log cabin on the grounds of the Shiloh Museum, believed to be built in 1854, was owned by several generations of the Ritter family, she said.

         HOT SPRINGS -- A man and woman were found deceased, both with apparent gunshot wounds, inside a Garland County residence on Thursday morning, according to a sheriff's office spokeswoman. Garland County sheriff's deputies and investigators along with LifeNet medical personnel responded to a call received at 11:13 a.m. Thursday regarding the bodies being discovered at the home at 228 Buxton Loop, Deputy Courtney Kizer said in a release. "Once on scene a male and female were both located unresponsive inside the home with apparent gunshot wounds," Kizer said. The Garland County coroner's office responded to the scene and pronounced both individuals deceased. A neighbor said the couple had been living at the residence for about 10 years. He said the man was "a good guy," but the couple was "having some problems." "This incident is currently under investigation," the release stated.

         SPRINGDALE -- A Springdale police officer shot a teen in the head Wednesday morning after the boy pointed a gun at him, according to a release from Capt. Jeff Taylor. The department received a call around 12:50 a.m. Wednesday saying a woman had been shot on Eicher Avenue in Springdale. When officers arrived, they found Argentina Agee, 31, shot in the arm, according to the news release. Officers were told the suspect was in a blue Chevrolet Tahoe, which they found nearby in the driveway at 1115 Eicher Ave., the release states. Eicher Avenue is about two blocks from Murphy Park. Officers found a 17-year-old lying under a blanket in the back seat. An officer opened the rear passenger door and told him to show his hands, according to the the release. The teen began to sit up, and as he did, he pointed a pistol at the officer who then fired, hitting the teen in the head, according to the news release. The teen's identity isn't being released at this time, the release states. Officers began providing first aid to the teen and Agee until paramedics arrived on the scene. Both the teen and Agee were taken to local hospitals for their injuries, according to the release. The investigation of use of deadly force by the officer as well as the shooting of the woman is being handled by the Washington County sheriff's office. The officer has been placed on paid administrative leave, which is standard protocol pending the sheriff's office investigation as well as an internal investigation, the release states. The shooting that injured the teen was the second time in two weeks an officer had fired his weapon at a suspect near Murphy Park. Police received a call about 6 p.m. Feb. 15 from a woman saying Ethan Brasel, 20, wouldn't get out of her car in the western parking lot of Murphy Park on South Pleasant Street, according to a department news release. The caller reported Brasel had a pistol in his front waistband and there was another gun in the car, police said. Officers said they found Brasel sitting in the front passenger seat of a white car. Officers ordered Brasel out of the car and asked if he had any weapons, the release says. Brasel said he didn't have a weapon, but officers could see a rifle in the front passenger seat of the vehicle, the release says. Brasel ran when one of the officers began to pat him down in a search for weapons, police said. An officer yelled Brasel had a gun as police chased him west from the park, police said. An officer ordered Brasel to drop the gun, according to the release. An officer then fired his gun at Brasel but didn't hit him, the release said. The call about Tuesday's shooting came from a house at the intersection of Eicher and South Pleasant Street, a half-mile south of Murphy Park, which also is on Pleasant, the site of the Feb. 15 shooting. Taylor said the shootings aren't related. Kelly Cantrell, a spokesman for the sheriff's office, said the investigation of that incident is continuing.

         The lead defendant in an FBI investigation into gang violence and drug trafficking in Arkansas was ordered Tuesday to remain in jail. "I do believe in the presumption of innocence," remarked U.S. Magistrate Judge Joe Volpe, in refusing a bond motion by Freddie Gladney Jr., 55, of Helena-West Helena, who was overheard on wiretaps discussing drugs and guns with three of his sons and arranging drug sales through a daughter, co-defendants in the case. "But the wire cases really bring a new facet to the analysis and the strength of the case and you really get to hear about what's going on and understand what's going on with an individual." Gladney was indicted in November on drug conspiracy and weapons charges following parallel investigations into the activities of two rival street gangs known as "EBK" -- Every Body Killas -- and Lodi Murder Mobb, which are believed to be responsible for what federal investigators have termed a "pipeline of drugs and guns" between Little Rock and Pine Bluff that are being trafficked throughout Central Arkansas. Gladney's indictment was tied to the EBK street gang. A second indictment resulting from the Lodi Murder Mobb investigation snared an additional 23 people, plus three more also named in the EBK indictment. Volpe said that evidence presented during the hearing indicated that Gladney had not only involved several of his children, including rapper Freddie Gladney III -- known as "Bankroll Freddie" -- but also that he was dealing in large quantities of cocaine and marijuana and at one point had offered to "cook" a quantity of cocaine down into crack for one of his sons for $100. Despite what Volpe termed to be a suitable release plan by Gladney's attorney, Robert Golden, which included placing Gladney under the supervision of a longtime friend who is now mayor of Lake View and runs a farm near there, the judge said there were no conditions that would ensure Gladney would not continue selling drugs remotely through others under his control. Jeff Highfill, an agent with the Little Rock FBI office, testified regarding a number of conversations recorded through wiretaps on various co-conspirators' cellphones, which included conversations about guns and drugs Gladney had with his sons: Bankroll Freddie, 28, of Jonesboro; Jamal Daniels, 28, of Myrtle Beach, S.C.; and Brandon Kingsley Robinson, 34, of Marianna. On one of the calls, Highfill said, Gladney was complaining to Daniels about a quantity of cocaine he suspected Robinson of stealing from him. Highfill said Daniels told Gladney that he had received about 11 grams of cocaine from Robinson to sell. "Yeah, that was my s***," Highfill quoted Gladney as saying. Darrin Davis, a longtime friend of Gladney's, testified that when word first began circulating of the charges against his friend, he had a Lake View police officer run a check on Gladney, which he said came back showing he had no warrants out for him. He said even after the indictment was unsealed in early November, Gladney was still seen around town appearing as though nothing was amiss. One of Gladney's daughters, Destiny Cartwright of Helena-West Helena, testified that Gladney had been at the federal courthouse recently when his son, Bankroll Freddie, had a hearing in the case. Asked why he didn't turn himself in at that time, Cartwright said it was discussed but said Gladney's attorney had advised against it. Under questioning by Assistant U.S. Attorney Amanda Fields, Cartwright said she could not recall the attorney's name. "For what proceeding?" Fields asked. "To turn himself in," Cartwright insisted. "He was here to turn himself in." Following Cartwright's testimony, Volpe told Golden his case for release had been stronger prior to her testimony. "It's clear your client knew he was wanted," Volpe said. The following day, Volpe approved the release of a defendant in the Lodi Murder Mobb indictment after a plan was agreed upon by the attorneys. On Wednesday, Volpe ordered Yuhanna "Noco" Clinkscale, 43, of Jonesboro, to be remanded to home detention and to submit to location monitoring by pre-trial services.

         100 years ago March 3, 1923 EARLE -- Earle's most spectacular fire in several years occurred early this morning when two two-story frame buildings in the heart of the business section were destroyed by fire. The structures were old landmarks, having been erected when the city was built about 20 years ago. One of the buildings was owned by Dr. W. W. Harrison and the other by J. G. Putnam. The Putnam building was operated as a hotel. The fire, which was of undetermined origin, started in the Harrison building, and the hotel guests left the hotel before they were in any danger. 50 years ago March 3, 1973 About 722 college students and 68 prospective employers got together Friday at Ricks Armory for Careers Day, sponsored by Arkansas Careers, Inc. The prospective employers included car sales agencies, public utilities, construction companies, the state government, the Army, Marine Corps and Air Force, the Internal Revenue Service and others. The seniors were primarily business majors looking for jobs after graduation in May. 25 years ago March 3, 1998 BENTONVILLE -- When he decides to expel one of his students at Siloam Springs High School, Ken Ramey said he walks a fine line. "You want to save them all, educate them all, but sometimes they do things that just shock you," Ramey said. Some students disrupt the process of education so much that they must be expelled, he said, even though the decision means they must be denied an education. Now, Ramey said, he has the opportunity to give those students a second chance through a new program in Bentonville called the Re-Entry School. Students who are in danger of being expelled from any district in Benton County can apply to attend the new school, where they learn academics with an emphasis on social skills and controlling anger. "This is a great option, because it gets the kids off the streets and they still get an education," Ramey said Monday. 10 years ago March 3, 2013 Walking into the Union Rescue Mission's new 14,000-square-foot men's facility, Robin Franke noticed the improvements from the former men's quarters, where her late husband once lived. For her and her children -- Mattie and Will Sukraw -- the opening of the men's facility at 2921 Confederate Blvd. in Little Rock on Saturday was a reminder of the influence her husband, Patrick Franke, had on their lives. "This is unbelievable," she said of the new building. "I wish the kids could get a glimpse of where Patrick had to live and sleep." The $1.5 million facility houses the mission's men's work and recovery-program dormitories as well as a 63-bed homeless shelter that will open Monday after a final code inspection of the kitchen.

        The Arkansas Senate on Thursday handily approved a bill that would repeal a state work permit requirement for children younger than 16 seeking employment. The Senate voted 24-9 to send House Bill 1410 by Rep. Rebecca Burkes, R-Lowell, to the governor. The bill would ax the state law that bars a person, firm or corporation from employing or permitting any children younger than 16 to work in or in connection with any establishment or occupation until the person, firm or corporation employing the child procures and keeps on file an employment certificate, accessible to the state Division of Labor, and the Division of Elementary and Secondary Education or local school officials. HB1410 also would eliminate the state law that requires the employment certificate to be issued by the Division of Labor director, and the application for the employment certificate to include a proof of age, a description of the work and work schedule, and written consent from the parent or guardian. Sen. Clint Penzo, R-Springdale, who is the Senate sponsor of HB1410, said 15 other states and the federal government don't require a work permit for 14- and 15-year-olds, who are not allowed to work in a dangerous setting under state and federal laws. "There is no reason that anyone should have to get the government's permission to get a job," he said. Penzo said, "We have got great laws to protect our kids, [but] the penalties are extremely weak," so he is working with the attorney general's office and Burkes on a bill that would strengthen criminal penalties. But Sen. Greg Leding, D-Fayetteville, said the state work permits for 14- and 15-year-olds are free and easy to get and serve an important role in protecting children in Arkansas. Sen. Linda Chesterfield, D-Little Rock, said signing a piece of paper isn't that big of a deal in order to protect children. Penzo said Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders supports the bill. Sanders spokeswoman Alexa Henning said, "The Governor believes protecting kids is most important, but doing so with arbitrary burdens on parents to get permission from the government for their child to get a job is burdensome and obsolete." "All child labor laws will still apply and we expect businesses to comply just as they are required to do now," Henning said in a written statement.

         Cut in jobless aid goes to governor The Arkansas Senate on Thursday sent the governor a bill that would reduce the amount of a time a person may receive unemployment benefits from four months to three months and cut unemployment insurance taxes. The Senate voted 29-3 to approve House Bill 1430 by Rep. Robin Lundstrum, R-Elm Springs. The legislation would drop the state's new employer tax from 2.9% to 1.9%. It also would cut the unemployment tax stabilization rate from 0.20% to 0.125% in fiscal 2024. In fiscal year 2025, the stabilization rate would drop to 0.1%. The bill also would reduce the assessed penalty rate on employers who fail to make unemployment-related payments on time from 14% to 10%. Arkansas unemployment insurance tax rates range from 0.1% to 5%, plus the stabilization rate in effect for the current year. The tax is computed on the wages paid to each employee on a calendar quarter basis, according to the Division of Workforce Services website. The measure would provide an unemployment insurance tax cut of $31 million, and the state's unemployment insurance trust fund has a balance of more than $900 million, said Sen. Kim Hammer, R-Benton, who is the Senate sponsor of HB1430. -- Michael R. Wickline and Will Langhorne Trafficking-suit bill clears Senate A bill intended to allow victims of human trafficking to sue their abusers without having to meet criminal law standards zipped through the Arkansas Senate on Thursday. The Senate voted 34-0 to send Senate Bill 282 by Sen. Missy Irvin, R-Mountain Home, to the House for further consideration. The bill would permit a human trafficking victim to bring a civil case in state court against a person or entity who knew "or should have known that the individual was or would be subjected to any form of trafficking." The person or entity also would have had to have caused, been responsible for, benefited financially from or received something of value from the human trafficking incident. Irvin said her bill mirrors standards used in federal anti-trafficking laws. The legislation would protect hotels and motels against insurance policy coverage exclusion based on intentional conduct. Irvin said her bill would apply the general negligence standard of "knew or should have known," which hotels and motels use for insuring against other risks, to trafficking. The bill includes language specifying the fault of "a victim of human trafficking shall not be apportioned against the victim of human trafficking" in a civil case. --- Michael R. Wickline and Will Langhorne Vincent Parks Act awaits signature The Arkansas Senate on Thursday sent the governor a bill that would require state fitness instructors to complete training on how to recognize and respond to certain health conditions. The Senate voted 34-0 to approve House Bill 1458 by Rep. Fran Cavenaugh, R-Walnut Ridge, which would create the Vincent Parks Act. The bill is intended to honor Parks, a Jonesboro police officer who died after training in extreme heat at the state police academy. The bill would require physical fitness instructors responsible for training law enforcement officers, firefighters and Arkansas Game and Fish Commission officers to receive certification on recognizing and managing dehydration and concussions. Instructors also would have to complete training on environmental issues that could threaten the health or safety of a person by causing heat exhaustion or sudden cardiac arrest. It would require physical fitness instructors to remove any cadet or officer who faints, loses consciousness or exhibits warning signs of cardiac arrest from training. A cadet or officer would be barred from returning to training until cleared in writing by a licensed physician. An instructor acting in good faith would not be liable for any act or omission under the bill unless the fault is intentional, reckless or grossly negligent. --- Michael R. Wickline Creation of 2 jobs get's panel's OK The Joint Budget Committee on Thursday approved Arkansas State University's request to create a dean of veterinary medicine post with a maximum-authorized salary of $350,000 a year as well as the state Department of Commerce's request to create the state's chief workforce officer position with a pay range of $149,862 to $181,500 a year, retroactive to Feb. 9. Arkansas State University Executive Vice Chancellor Len Frey said in a letter dated Feb. 15 to state Division of Higher Education Director Maria Markham that a dean of veterinary medicine is needed for ASU to implement a College of Veterinary Medicine, which is needed to meet the demand for veterinarians in Arkansas and the national shortage. The state Department of Commerce requested the creation of a post for the state's chief workforce officer to coordinate, manage and direct Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders' workforce development policies and career education strategy for the state, Department of Commerce Secretary Hugh McDonald said in a letter dated Feb. 9 to the state's personnel administrator, Kay Barnhill. On Feb. 9, Sanders announced the creation of a new workforce cabinet that will advise her on how to best spend public dollars to train and educate Arkansans for their careers, and that Mike Rogers, senior director of maintenance and refrigeration at Tyson Foods, will serve as the governor's chief workforce officer. Rogers' base salary is $167,000 a year, retroactive to Feb. 9, said Department of Commerce Chief of Staff Jim Hudson. -- Michael R. Wickline Senate likes votes on ad, promo taxes The Senate on Thursday approved a bill that would require voter approval of any new advertising and promotion taxes or any increase in existing advertising and promotion taxes. The Senate voted 31-0 to send House Bill 1027 by Rep. David Ray, R-Maumelle, to the governor. The bill won't affect existing advertising and promotion taxes, said Sen. Mark Johnson, R-Ferndale, the Senate sponsor of HB1027. -- Michael R. Wickline House backs study of state spaceport The House on Thursday advanced a bill that would allow state officials to conduct a feasibility study for the development of a spaceport if funding becomes available. House Bill 1499 by Rep. Aaron Pilkington, R-Knoxville, advanced to the Senate with a vote of 89-3. The measure would permit the Arkansas Economic Development Commission to study the potential market and interest in a state spaceport. Arkansas' central location in the United States makes it an ideal site for launching satellites and other space missions. The state's relatively low population density also makes it an attractive location for a spaceport, Pilkington said while speaking on the House floor. The bill does not allocate any funds for a potential study. Lawmakers would have to pass a separate appropriation to fund the study. Federal grants also may be available for the work, Pilkington said. He said he expects the study would cost roughly $900,000. If funding becomes available, state officials would have to complete the feasibility study by Jan. 1, 2024. -- Will Langhorne  Print Headline: State Capitol news in brief Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         Mayflower police on Wednesday arrested a man who faces a murder charge in a Jan. 14 shooting just off Interstate 40, according to a Facebook post from police. Dylan Collins, whose age was not given, is charged with capital murder in relation to the fatal shooting, which occurred on the on-ramp from Arkansas 89 South at about 12:20 p.m. The Wednesday post did not provide any information about the victim, which an earlier post identified as a man. Detectives interviewed Collins ahead of the arrest and served several search warrants, including one on his residence.

         Volunteer firefighters and deputies rescued two people from a Miller County residence that collapsed from damage caused by a tornado that struck southwestern Arkansas on Thursday evening. The rescue workers got the two people out without injury, said Michael Godfrey, director of the Miller County Office of Emergency Management. The National Weather Service's North Little Rock office could confirm that a tornado struck Miller County sometime between 5:45 and 6:30 p.m., but could not provide further details Thursday, said Joe Goudsward, a senior forecaster with the service. "We've been pretty lucky," Godfrey said. He praised the work of the volunteer firefighters, who were clearing downed trees and tree debris from Tennessee Road east of Texarkana late Thursday and had extinguished a fire that started when a tree fell across power line on U.S. 237 south of Texarkana. The tornado struck as thunderstorms moved across Arkansas on Thursday evening, with a tornado watch covering much of the central and southern parts of the state. The weather service predicted that rainfall would continue throughout the night, with flash flood warnings active in some areas. In some areas, meteorologists predicted up to golf-ball-sized hail.

         A Texas woman who pleaded guilty to involvement in an altercation aboard a Southwest Airlines flight in which a flight attendant's jaw was broken was sentenced Thursday to five years on federal probation by a judge who questioned why the woman was not charged with a felony. Brenda Marie Aquino-Washington, 22, of El Paso, pleaded guilty in January to a misdemeanor count of assault in maritime and territorial jurisdiction, for which she could have received a maximum prison term of one year and a fine of $100,000. Instead, U.S. District Judge Brian Miller elected to sentence Aquino to the maximum statutory term of five years on probation -- drawing an objection from Aquino's attorney because the sentence exceeded the maximum three-year probation term recommended by the U.S. sentencing guidelines -- and a fine of $250, which is one-half the low-end guideline range recommendation of $500 to $9,500. According to court records, on Jan. 9, 2021, Little Rock police responded to the Little Rock National Airport after being notified of an unruly passenger onboard a domestic flight. Upon arrival, police were told that Aquino-Washington, while onboard the flight from Nashville, Tenn. to San Antonio, Texas, removed her face mask several times and became combative when told to put it back on. Witnesses said Aquino-Washington tossed food in a flight attendant's face, then repeatedly punched her in the face until another flight attendant was able to subdue her and put her in restraints until the plane could land. Aquino-Washington's attorney, KenDrell Collins with the Federal Public Defenders Office in Little Rock, described his client's actions that day as being brought on by what he said was later diagnosed as having bipolar disorder that she is now being treated for. "She's been doing well," Collins said. "She's been working consistently, living her own life and doing all of the things she's supposed to do. I think this is just a situation where probation will be appropriate." "So your argument is this is a mental health event and the first time it happened?" asked Miller. "It's not like she was on notice this could happen and she went on the plane anyway?" Assistant U.S. Attorney Kristin Bryant said her office had struggled with how to charge the offense given the nature and circumstances of the defendant as having had a mental health crisis coupled with the nature of the injuries suffered by the flight attendant, which include constant pain and partial paralysis of her jaw. Bryant did not ask for jail time for Aquino-Washington but instead asked for the statutory maximum of five years probation. "That way we can be assured she is getting mental health treatment," Bryant said. Aquino-Washington, who appeared via video-conference from her home in El Paso, read from a prepared statement to say she was "deeply sorry for the actions I did before my diagnosis."

         FAYETTEVILLE -- No-knock warrants too often have tragic outcomes, and if they had been banned in Minneapolis, "that could've saved [my son's] life," said Andre "Buddy" Locke Sr. In February 2022, his son, Amir Locke, 22, was shot and killed by police officers during a no-knock warrant in Minneapolis. He was sleeping on a couch when a SWAT team entered the living room of his cousin's apartment. He woke up and grabbed a nearby handgun -- which he was licensed to carry -- and was shot three times. Police were searching for a homicide suspect who was not home at the time, and Locke was not a part of the investigation. "He was sleeping," he was then "startled," and he "couldn't even get the covers off his head," Locke's father said Thursday. "That definitely hurt [and] this is what we live with daily." No criminal charges were ever filed against the officers involved in the shooting, but the city of Minneapolis implemented a new ban on no-knock warrants. Currently, Florida, Oregon, Connecticut, Tennessee and Virginia have completely outlawed no-knock warrants. Locke's father and mother, Karen Wells, now advocate to end no-knock warrants nationwide, as well as for police and criminal justice reform. The elder Locke, Wells, and attorney Jeff Storms, who -- along with Antonio Romanucci and Ben Crump -- is representing the family in a lawsuit, visited the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville on Thursday to share their story at an event hosted by the Solidarity Society in conjunction with the Multicultural Center, Undergraduate Mock Trial and Young Democrats. "We're standing and speaking up for Amir," Wells said. "Why wasn't he given a chance to say who he was? It's not right." In February, Locke's family filed a civil lawsuit against the city of Minneapolis, claiming Locke's 4th and 14th Amendment constitutional rights were violated -- as well as state laws -- and seeking compensatory and punitive damages. No-knock warrants -- in which a judge issues a warrant that allows law enforcement to enter a property without immediate prior notification of the resident -- have become increasingly prevalent, but also contentious. For example, Louisville Metro Police obtained a no-knock warrant for the apartment of Breonna Taylor, who was later killed by police in her apartment in March 2020 by police during an exchange of gunfire with her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, who claimed he never heard the police announce their presence prior to entry. "For too long, this was in a vacuum, [and] people didn't see it, hear about it, or pay attention," said Storms, who focuses primarily on civil rights cases. It's "heartbreaking to see the same mistakes in our community over and over again." Even though the names of those killed at the hands of police can seem to stack up, it's paramount to remember the humanity of each individual victim, panelists said, because every death rips a gaping hole through families. When Nigel Caffey learned his nephew, Terence Caffey, 30, of Little Rock, died shortly after being arrested at a Little Rock movie theater in December 2021 by Pulaski County sheriff's deputies and Little Rock police officers, "I almost died," he said. "That takes everything out of you, [and] our lives will forever be changed." Caffey, who was also part of Thursday's panel, said he's appalled by the behavior of officers and first responders toward his nephew. Terence Caffey was arrested after he began fighting with theater employees. They "disregarded a human's life," Caffey said of the treatment of his nephew. "[I want] to let his story be known." A death like Caffey's or Locke's "really damages a family -- I'm not the same person I was before -- and I'm not [the only one] damaged by it," Wells said. So, too, are his siblings and other relatives. "Our 22-year-old baby was taken away by someone who was supposed to protect and serve," she said. "I'm a broken mother." In fact, she tells herself Amir is "on vacation," she said. "It makes me feel like I'll see him again," even though that won't happen until "I cross over." When the elder Locke learned of his son's death, he "couldn't believe it," he said. "We always 'see' our son, [and] it's not easy" to live with this tragedy, but "accountability and transparency are so important" to regain the public's trust. When officers "do wrong, they need to own up to it and say, 'I messed up,'" then face any consequences, Wells said. They also need to practice sincere community policing, interacting positively with the public in the communities they police. "Get out of your car [to] have friendly conversations [and] open dialogue," she said. Her 6-year-old granddaughter "doesn't trust the police -- how is an officer going to gain her respect? Respect is earned, not given." For people of color, particularly Black male youth, interacting with police can be "terrifying," as they must confront "a range of horrible possible outcomes," Storms said. "We need to change that so we can all feel safe in our communities."  Print Headline: No-knock warrants called deadly Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         Man arrested on two felony counts Little Rock police on Wednesday morning arrested a man who brandished a hatchet at and bit someone who tried to stop him from stealing packages, according to an arrest report. Justin Evans, 29, of Little Rock, was identified in the report as the person attempting to steal packages from 120 Rice St. A neighbor tried to stop Evans, who police say attacked and bit the neighbor before pulling out a hatchet and waving it at the man. Police say Evans then fled the scene on a bicycle, which they were able to find. The person on the bike, who did not seem to be related to the incident, told them where to find Evans, who was arrested around 9:40 a.m. near 117 N. Park St., police said. Evans, who the report states is homeless, faces two felony counts of aggravated robbery and theft of property as well as a misdemeanor third-degree battery charge. He was being held Thursday night in the Pulaski County jail on a $50,000 bond, the jail's online inmate roster states.

         Of all the possible campus closures that could have taken place in the Pine Bluff School District, Jack Robey Junior High was the last one Mattie Collins expected. "Of course, I was disappointed," Collins said, reacting to Superintendent Jennifer Barbaree's announcement the district's secondary schools would be consolidated down to Robert F. Morehead Middle School (grades 7-9) and Pine Bluff High School (grades 10-12) starting with the 2023-24 school year, closing Jack Robey and Dollarway High School. "I live right down the street from Jack Robey. My daughter went to Jack Robey. I love the school." Following a video message announcing the mergers Wednesday, Barbaree said the district must reduce the number of campuses in operation from nine to seven to remain fiscally strong and help it to exit state control. Barbaree said it would have been more expensive to make needed repairs to Jack Robey, which opened in 1986, than keep the Morehead campus, which opened in 1999, in operation. Losing Jack Robey after this school year came as a surprise to Collins, a retired PBHS world history teacher. She wished that could have been part of the agenda at Monday's board meeting. "I wasn't prepared for it," Collins said. "I thought the community would talk about something that big before it happened. I love the kids, and I'll always want to do what's best for them, not for me. I think it deserves a community discussion. Our kids are important, no matter where they live." Barbaree said she did not meet with community members about the mergers, adding the decision would affect faculty and staff the most. Rosalind Mouser, an attorney and district supporter, said she wasn't surprised by the decision. "The reason I would say that is when Dollarway was annexed into Pine Bluff, we were always going to have too many buildings because we had a decline in the number of students," Mouser said. "I don't know that I would be surprised by what Superintendent Barbaree announced. She personally informed me she was walking through all the buildings." Mouser said she would defer to Barbaree's knowledge and expertise, adding she had to take into consideration the number of students on each campus and the condition of buildings. "I think she's looking at all of those aspects to keep children safe," Mouser said. Then-Superintendent Barbara Warren last year considered Jack Robey a temporary site for Pine Bluff High students to attend when the latter campus was addressing its safety infrastructure due to acts of violence on or near the campus. That further confused Collins as to why Jack Robey would be shut down. Since then, the PBSD has beefed up security and installed fencing around the school. LOSING DOLLARWAY HIGH Consolidating the student body at Dollarway High into Pine Bluff High was expected, after the Dollarway School District was annexed into the PBSD in July 2021. That didn't make receiving the news any easier for Booker Mays Jr., a district assistant athletic director who joined Dollarway schools as a junior high teacher and coach in 1990. "Like a bombshell, but you knew it was coming," Mays said. "You just hated to see it come." Dollarway and Pine Bluff high schools have fallen on hard times in recent years, largely due to academic issues and fiscal distress due to a dropping student population. According to data from the Arkansas Department of Education, Dollarway enrolls 163 students in grades 10-12, compared to 583 students at Pine Bluff High. "We've got to go by what the data says, and the data says we're low in numbers, and the administrators and everyone else thought it was best to go on ahead and put everybody together," said James Jones, a longtime basketball coach at the Morehead and Dollarway High campuses. "Data doesn't lie, and the data kind of supported that decision." Barbaree also said she will recommend to the PBSD limited-authority board that some non-licensed teachers not have their contracts renewed, although she doesn't intend to do a reduction in force. "It's going to be a lot of people losing positions," Mays said. "It's just sad to see Dollarway come to an end after 33 years of being a powerhouse that everybody in the state respected." Mays learned about the upcoming mergers as Barbaree met with Dollarway High teachers at the school cafeteria Wednesday. Barbaree informed teachers and staff members at each PBSD campus ahead of her recorded message. The campus, renovated in 2009, could still be used to house some junior high students since it is across the street from Morehead. "The air didn't go out of the room," Mays said. "Everybody had an inkling of what was going to happen. They've been saying it for two years now, and it finally came to fruition [Wednesday]." ALL ZEBRAS With the mergers, all athletic and activity clubs will be known as the Pine Bluff Zebras, effectively retiring the Dollarway Cardinals brand. "A lot of people are excited about it, and then some people are not so excited about it," Billy Dixon, the PBSD athletic director and Zebras basketball head coach, said on the eve of his 5A state quarterfinal game against Nettleton today. "Anytime you have that type of consolidation take place, people losing their alma mater, losing what they've worked for years for, some of those people are going to be disappointed." Collins, a community volunteer known for her presence in education-related events, noted some of the disdain from parents who asked her about the impending mergers. "All of them are upset because they love their school," she said. "This was a total shock. "I don't know why we weren't called. To me, that should have been on the agenda." The transition to an all-Zebra identity has been slow, given the district annexation that followed the state's 2015 takeover of the Dollarway district and 2018 takeover of the PBSD, Dixon said. Pine Bluff will remain in Class 5A, the second-highest level under the Arkansas Activities Association based on student population for sports other than football (in which 7A is the highest), and Dixon anticipates the Zebras will remain there for the AAA's 2024-26 conferencing cycle. "We want a positive approach to welcoming those kids to the Pine Bluff School District and seeing things happen in athletics the way it should happen," he said.

        BENTONVILLE -- Sheriff Shawn Holloway on Thursday led a tour of the Benton County Jail for members of the county's new Detention and Facilities Subcommittee and pointed out some of the main areas of concern and reasons to expand the jail. It was the first meeting for the subcommittee, which county officials created to study possible solutions for the jail and court facilities after voters in November rejected two tax proposals dealing with jail expansion. Justice of the Peace Joel Edwards is subcommittee chairman. Other members include Justices of the Peace Brian Armas, Carrie Perrien Smith, Joseph Bollinger, Richard McKeehan, Ron Homeyer and Danny McCrackin. Holloway told the subcommittee the jail needs more space for the medical and kitchen areas. He said only one inmate at a time can be held and treated in the medical wing while the kitchen is set to feed 400 inmates, but the jail has held more than 800 inmates at times in the past year. Holloway said the jail needs more space for inmates to participate in religious or other activities that may help reduce recidivism. More beds are also needed to deal with the county's growing population, he said. The jail had 708 inmates Thursday, according to the Sheriff's Office's website. The jail has 669 beds, but inmates must be segregated by different categories. Holloway said ideally the jail should be holding no more than 535 people. The jail is not holding any misdemeanor prisoners due to lack of space and that's one situation that must be resolved, he said. He added the jail also needs a place to safely hold people with mental illnesses. Holloway said if the Sheriff's Office adds 200 beds it would cost $1.5 million annually. The county has $29 million for capital expenditures and $14 million in reserves, Edwards said. Bail reform is a state issue and not one the subcommittee can resolve, he said. He said the Benton County Quorum Court will focus on issues it can resolve since the Quorum Court cannot tell judges how to run their courtrooms or the sheriff how to run the jail. He said the Quorum Court controls only the amount of money given to the judges and sheriff. The subcommittee will meet regularly, Edwards said. He said the subcommittee will also have to deal with the long-term issue of the Benton County Courthouse, especially when the county gets its eighth circuit judge. During time allotted for public comment, Sarah Moore, executive director of the Arkansas Justice Reform Coalition, said jail crowding could be resolved if the Sheriff's Office found alternatives for people accused of low-level felonies instead of holding them in jail. She urged the subcommittee to look at alternatives instead of focusing on increasing the number of beds. Curt Clark, who owns Action Bail Bond, urged the subcommittee to use common sense to come up with solutions to problems at the jail. Jon Comstock, also with the reform coalition, urged the subcommittee to convince judges to reduce bond amounts, which he said would immediately reduce the jail population. He said he was pleased Holloway wanted to tackle recidivism in the jail. The county's voters in November rejected a temporary sales tax that would have financed a $241 million plan to expand the jail and build a new criminal justice complex. Voters also turned down a permanent sales tax to pay for jail operations. Edwards pointed out the Quorum Court overwhelmingly supported the sales tax measures. He said additional beds will have to be part of any proposal.  Print Headline: Benton County subcommittee tours jail, hears about space issue Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        PEA RIDGE -- Mayor Nathan See said city officials doing the final inspection of Hazelton Road noticed the road surface did not meet city specifications. See said he contacted Chris McDaniel, owner and chief financial officer of Arco Excavation & Paving, and McDaniel agreed to resolve the problem. See, who served as the city's Street Department superintendent for several years, said the crew paving the street tried to lay the asphalt when temperatures were too cold resulting in a rough, wavy surface. The faulty surface was milled and removed. The road will be resurfaced at the company's cost with no cost to the city, according to the mayor. Hazelton Road is an east-west thoroughfare connecting Weston Street and It'll Do Road as well as providing access to a couple of subdivisions.

        PEA RIDGE -- The City Council approved annexing land that is surrounded by city limits Feb. 21. The property will come into the city zoned as agricultural, according to the mayor, who said rezoning will be addressed at a different time. A city resident, Stephanie Kotouc, questioned zoning and said no adjacent property owners received notification of the annexation. The mayor explained that the notification is for zoning, not for annexation of an "island." City Attorney Shane Perry said the emergency clause was to be struck from the ordinance. He said the property owners can not seek a rezoning until after 30 days. City Clerk Sandy Button said the Northwest Arkansas Regional Planning Commission handled the annexation paperwork. "There is a lot of money invested in this by the city," Button said, referring to the notice of public hearing. "We did everything they asked us to do." Council member Nadine Telgemeier asked why the regional planning commission was involved. See said that on island and majority annexations, the city relies on the commission's expertise.

        SILOAM SPRINGS -- The Planning Commission approved a code change Feb. 14, placing a cap on the number of short-term rentals allowed in the city. Commissioners voted unanimously to approve the code change, which will go before the city's Board of Directors on Tuesday. If approved by the board, the code change will cap the number of short-term rental permits and/or business licenses to 64 within the city, according to senior planner Ben Rhoads. "We are capping both special use permits and business licenses, whichever gets to 64," Rhoads said. The city presently has 27 short-term rentals, Rhoads said in a staff report he prepared Feb. 6. Once the 64 cap is met no other permits or licenses for short-term rentals will be issued unless one or more should cease operation, Rhoads said. Currently the city has more special use permits than business licenses, Rhoads said. Staff has provided a process for previously approved short-term rentals by special use permits and/or business licenses to be canceled by the applicant and are no longer required, Rhoads said. This will open spots for additional permits after unused ones are canceled, Rhoads said. With only 27 short-term rentals, the cap will not happen right away, Rhoads said. Part of the requirements include having a valid business license or remittance of the hotel/motel tax limiting only to overnight accommodations and limiting occupancy to no more than three guests per bedroom, Rhoads said. Audience members chose not to speak during the public comment portion. Several commissioners posed questions to Rhoads. Commissioner Ted Song asked Rhoads to explain the difference between the permit and a business license. Rhoads said special use permits are used for short-term rentals in residential areas in conjunction with a business license, while the business license is used for anyone operating a business. A question about grandfathering was asked by Commissioner Katie Rennard. Rennard asked about a short-term rental on Jefferson Street that is rented out by the day or half-day, which would be grandfathered in, wondering how to monitor the location. Rhoads told her that one way is to look at the sales tax receipts to see if it is in operation, but as to duration of rental agreements it would have to go on a case-by-case basis. He also said if the property is not used in one year's time, the permit is canceled. Commissioner Kevin Williams asked if the number will change as more homes are built. Rhoads said since the number is based on the 2020 census, the number will stay the same until 2030. After more discussion, the commissioners voted to approve the code change. The Planning Commission also: Approved a special use permit for 411 N. Broadway St. This item will go before the city board on Tuesday. Approved a special use permit for 315 W. Harvard St. This item will go before the city board on Tuesday. Approved a rezoning development for the 21000 block of South Arkansas 16. This item will go before the city board on Tuesday. Approved a significant development permit for 1750 S. Lincoln St. Tabled a preliminary plat development permit for 2270 Dawn Hill Road until the March 14 meeting of the Planning Commission. Approved a final plat development permit for 650 W. U.S. 412. Amending city code concerning mini storage units. This item will go before the city board on Tuesday.

        Volunteer firefighters and deputies rescued two people from a Miller County residence that collapsed from damage caused by a tornado that struck southwestern Arkansas on Thursday evening.The rescue workers got the two people out without injury, said Michael Godfrey, director of the Miller County Office of Emergency Management.The National Weather Service's North Little Rock office could confirm that a tornado struck Miller County sometime between 5:45 and 6:30 p.m., but could not provide further details Thursday, said Joe Goudsward, a senior forecaster with the service.“Weve been pretty lucky,” Godfrey said.He praised the work of the volunteer firefighters, who were clearing downed trees and tree debris from Tennessee Road east of Texarkana late Thursday and had extinguished a fire that started when a tree fell across power line on U.S. 237 south of Texarkana.The weather service predicted that rainfall would continue throughout the night, with flash flood warnings active in some parts of the state. In some areas, meteorologists predicted up to golf-ball-sized hail. Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        At 5:40 p.m., the National Weather Service issued a tornado watch for 15 counties in southern Arkansas until midnight. The watch is in place for Arkansas, Bradley, Clark, Cleveland, Dallas, Desha, Drew, Garland, Hot Spring, Jefferson, Lincoln, Montgomery, Nevada, Ouachita and Pike counties. 11: 44 a.m.: Southern Arkansas expected to face 'significant threat' of tornadoes, damaging winds, large hail, forecasters say The National Weather Service in North Little Rock is forecasting a "powerhouse of a storm system" that could move through southern portions of Arkansas Thursday evening and into the overnight hours. A Thursday morning briefing from the weather service said there is a Moderate Risk of a severe weather outbreak in the southern half of Arkansas, and that there will be a "significant threat" of tornadoes, widespread damaging winds of more than 80 mph, and baseball-sized hail there. All are possible. The Moderate Risk alert stretches from Texarkana up to Hot Springs. Central and Southeast Arkansas are at an Enhanced Risk of severe thunderstorms. According to a radar model, the storm front is expected to enter the state around 7 p.m. It will move into the central part of the state around 11 p.m., before exiting the state about three hours later. The storms are expected to bring several inches of rain through Friday morning. With the ground saturated in many areas, flash flooding is expected. Ongoing river flooding — especially in the White River Basin — will worsen with new river flooding possible in other basins. A Flood Watch is in effect for the majority of the state through Friday morning. Southwest winds of 25 to 35 mph, with gusts of up to 50 mph, are also possible over a large section of the state. Only Northwest Arkansas is not under a Wind Advisory. Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders education overhaul passed the Arkansas House of Representatives on Thursday, sending the bill to the Senate for a concurring vote. Senate Bill 294, also known as the LEARNS Act, is Sanders' education reform initiative, an omnibus bill that includes state funds that students could use to attend a private or home school and a $14,000 raise in the starting salary for teachers. The bill passed the House on a 78 to 21 vote. The Senate will still need to vote to concur with the Houses amendment to the bill before the bill heads to Sanders for her signature. Since lawmakers introduced the bill 10-days ago, many lawmakers, parents, teachers, superintendents and activists have debated aspects of the 144-page bill. Critics took aim at bills voucher program, called Educational Freedom Accounts, which will funnel money out of public schools while supporters have said school choice will empower parents. For more than 90 minutes of debate Thursday, lawmakers took turns speaking for and against the legislation. Rep. Jim Wooten, R-Beebe, gave an impassioned 15-minute speech against the bill, admitting it was hard as a Republican to take such a strong stance against Sanders' signature issue, saying “I feel like a voice crying in the wilderness.” Wooten said the bill is an “insult” to public education, saying critics of Arkansas' public schools did not understand social ills such as poverty, drug addiction and broken families that affect public schools, which unlike private schools, cannot screen or turn away students. “Through this this bill we have managed to insult, alienate, dislike, show disdain for every single person in this state that has anything to do with public education,” Wooten said. Supporters of the bill said it is a fix to the status quo in Arkansas that is failing students, noting that the state has ranked near the bottom in education for years. Rep. Carlton Wing, R-North Little Rock, said the bill was a part of American tradition that emphasizes “individual liberty,” empowering parents to decide what is best for their children. Other supporters said the bills funding for literacy coaches and tutors, and higher salaries for teachers, will facilitate a long-need fundamental change that will drastically improve education within the state. “What in the world is so terrible about parents getting to choose the school where their children attend and allowing the tax dollars to follow the student to that school?” Rep. David Ray, R-Maumelle, asked. The LEARNS Act will increase the states minimum salary for teachers from $36,000 to $50,000 and give $2,000 raises for teachers making more than the new proposed minimum. Teachers also could receive up to $10,000 in bonuses for high tests scores, or teaching in a geographical area or a subject matter in high demand. According to the bill, the voucher program will be phased in over three years beginning in the 2023-2024 school year, with students receiving 90% of foundation funding from the previous school year, which was $7,413 for the 2022-2023 school year.

         Fueled by a jump in sales and use tax collections, Arkansas general revenue collections in February increased by $44 million, or 8.3%, over the same month a year ago to $572.4 million and beat the states latest forecast by $58.3 million, or 11.3%. The state's sales and use tax collections increased by $29.9 million, or 13.1%, over a year go to $258.1 million, outdistancing the state's forecast by $27 million, or 11.7 %, the state Department of Finance and Administration reported Thursday morning in its monthly revenue report. Finance department Secretary Larry Walther said revenue growth was above expectations again in February, demonstrating continued economic growth in Arkansas. "Additionally, tax refunds are on track with the forecast as we enter the busiest months for filing," he said in a written statement. Tax refunds and some special government expenditures are taken off the top of total general revenue collections, leaving a net amount that state agencies are allowed to spend up to the amount authorized by the states Revenue Stabilization Act. The states net tax revenue in February dipped by $4.6 million, or 1.1%, from the same month a year ago to $402.1 million, but exceeded the states Nov. 10 forecast by $55 million, or 16%. February is the eighth month of fiscal year 2023, which started July 1, 2022, and ends June 30. During the first eight months of fiscal 2023, the states total general revenue increased by $318.2 million, or 6.1%, over the same period in fiscal 2022 to $5.5 billion and beat the states forecast by $262.7 million, or 5%. So far in fiscal 2023, the states net general revenue increased by $201.4 million, or 4.4%, over the same period in fiscal 2022 to $4.7 billion and outdistanced the states forecast by $250.2 million, or 5.6%. The state has projected a general revenue surplus of nearly $600 million at the end of fiscal 2023.  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        Dr. Brian Hyatt stepped down as chairman of the Arkansas State Medical Board Thursday in a special meeting following "credible allegations of fraud," noted in a letter from the state's Office of Medicaid Inspector General. Members of the board gathered online Thursday in a meeting with only one item on the agenda: "Discussion of Arkansas State Board's leadership."  The motion to approve Hyatt's request to step down as chairman and out of an executive role was approved unanimously. Board members also decided that Dr. Rhys Branman will take over as the interim chairman until an election to fill the seat is held in April. According to the board Thursday, the vacant seats for vice chair and chair of the board will be voted on separate ballots in the April elections. Prior coverage by a Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reporter states that "red flags" were discovered in Hyatt's use of Medicaid claims and process of billing for medical services. In Arkansas, Medicaid fraud resulting in an overpayment over $2,500 is a felony. Another board member spoke Thursday, but did not identify himself, adding: "There's a process. He's going to go through the same process as everyone else and he's done the responsible thing of stepping aside as chair so that the board can continue to take care of the business we're supposed to without any distractions." Barnman joined the discussion, asking Dr. Sylvia Simon how the board has handled instances like this in the past. "We get these [allegations] periodically that are issues with an insurance company, being thrown off of an insurance company or income tax-evasion. Until they're convicted of a crime of some sort, we don't do anything with it except monitor the situation," Simon said. "If it's something that has resulted in arrest or could be a direct danger to patients like allegations of molesting patients in the office, substance abuse or things that would pose an immediate danger to patients or the public in general -- then you would consider something like an emergency order of suspension." Hyatt, a psychiatrist out of Rogers, was appointed to the board in 2019 by former Governor Asa Hutchinson. At this time, Hyatt has not been charged of any crimes. The board said the investigation of Hyatt's allegations will continue and they will continue to monitor the situation. CORRECTION: Board members  decided that Dr. Rhys Branman will take over as the interim chairman. An earlier version of this story incorrectly spelled Branman's name.

         SPRINGDALE -- AQ Chicken House plans to shut its doors after seven and a half decades of business in Springdale. The restaurant's last day of business at 1207 N. Thompson St. will be March 18, according to manager Kaleesa Sanders. She said she did not know anything else about the closing. Owner Dick Bradley said in December there was a pending contract for a company to buy the property, but the company involved was "doing their due diligence" and had not yet accepted a deal. It was unclear as of Thursday morning whether that deal was completed. Roy Ritter opened AQ Chicken House in 1947. In the beginning, when Thompson Avenue was still a dirt road, chickens were raised, killed, cleaned and processed right behind the restaurant, according to Kat Robinson's book "Classic Eateries of the Ozarks and Arkansas River Valley." The menu has served chicken in all forms over the years. Some of the signature dishes have included pan-fried chicken, often served with spaghetti, and the AQ Pickle O's, battered and fried dill pickle bites. The restaurant was sold to Frank Hickingbotham and Ron Palmer in 1981, Robinson writes. In 1998, Bradley sold his Lincoln chicken farm to buy the business. President Bill Clinton celebrated his 47th birthday with pan-fried chicken at the restaurant and George W. Bush once ordered some AQ chicken from Air Force One, according to the restaurant's website. A second AQ location at 1925 N. College Ave. in Fayetteville was open from 1991 to 2016. AQ, which stands for Arkansas Quality, is one of a few U.S. 71 restaurants like Herman's Ribhouse in Fayetteville and Neal's Cafe in Springdale that long predate the arrival of the interstate in Northwest Arkansas. Another such restaurant, Fred's Hickory Inn in Bentonville, was sold last year to new owners and has since been renamed.

        The House Education Committee moved forward Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders' education overhaul Wednesday, sending the bill to the House of Representatives. The committee approved the bill on a voice vote, and it will head to the House floor for a vote today, House Speaker Matthew Shepherd said. The committee's vote comes after seven hours of public testimony Tuesday with 94 members of the public signing up to speak for and against the bill during the hearing. "My signature Arkansas LEARNS is headed to the House floor," Sanders tweeted after the committee's vote. "I am not interested in being a caretaker of the failed status quo -- I vowed to be [a] change-maker for the people. We are one step closer to huge, transformational education reform that will impact generations of Arkansans." The Republican governor has described Senate Bill 294 as her top legislative priority since taking office in January. The 144-page bill is an omnibus package that Sanders said is "the most bold, comprehensive, conservative education reform package in the nation." The bill includes a phased-in voucher program to attend a private or home school. It also calls for a $14,000 increase in the starting salary for teachers and funding for literacy coaches to boost reading levels for elementary students. With 54 of 100 House members listed as co-sponsors, it is likely the House will pass the bill today. If approved by the House, the LEARNS Act would move back to the Senate for a concurring vote before heading to the governor's desk for her signature. "I believe this is a compromise bill," said Rep. Brit McKenzie, R-Rogers. "I think that there are things that we can take back to teachers, we can take back to students, we can take back to our parents, we can take to our administrators, and albeit, it's not the best bill. It is the best bill for our students." Perhaps the most contentious part of the bill is the proposed voucher program, called Educational Freedom Accounts, which will allow students to use 90% of foundation funding from the previous school year to go toward a private or home school. For the 2022-2023 school year, foundation funding per student was $7,413. The voucher program will be phased in over three years, beginning in the 2023-2024 school year for students in F-rated schools; enrolled in kindergarten; who were or are in a foster care program; who have a disability; or who have an active-duty military parent. For the 2024-2025 school year, the voucher program will expand to students attending a D-rated school; who have a parent who is a military veteran; or who are children of first responders. By the 2025-2026 school year, every student who is eligible to enroll in a public school will be eligible for a voucher to attend a private or home school. For Sanders, the voucher program is a way to help students in struggling school districts not be trapped by their ZIP code, by letting the state funds for public schools also be used on a private or home school education. During a hearing Tuesday, some parents said private and home schools could provide the type of intensive care and education public schools cannot provide to many special needs children. For many, the bill is an aggressive attempt to reform education in Arkansas, which lags behind the national average in reading and math scores. "Ultimately when you look at the bill in its entirety, what we all want is to finally do something that will take our state from the bottom of the rankings, where we are year after year, and deliver something big and bold for Arkansas and for the students," said Rep. Grant Hodges, R-Centerton. Critics contend vouchers would drain funding from public schools, many of which are already underfunded and under-resourced. Opponents of the bill also said public schools, unlike private schools, do not have the option of turning away students and holding the schools to similar standards is unfair. Others argued that vouchers would only partially cover tuition for private schools and would mostly benefit middle- and upper-class families who already have funds to afford a private education. Rep. Denise Garner, D-Fayetteville, took issue with the bill's voucher program, saying studies have shown they do not work. "Vouchers do not support students with disabilities, and it does exacerbate segregation, skirt accountability and transparency, funds discrimination and leaves underserved students and communities behind," Garner said. Others pointed to what they saw as a rushed process that they contend did not include enough input from teachers and administrators while the bill was being crafted. Last week, the Senate approved the bill with one Republican, Sen. Jimmy Hickey Jr., of Texarkana, voting "no," saying he was not given enough time to read the bill. The bill was filed Feb. 20 and passed by the Senate three days later. "It won't be even within two weeks that this bill was made available to the public, made available to educators, education administration, parents and, obviously, you've heard plenty enough testimony that it is not enough time for anyone," Rep. Vivian Flowers, D-Pine Bluff, said Wednesday. The $50,000 starting salary mandated by the bill would boost Arkansas to near the top in the country in minimum pay for educators and offer $2,000 raises to those making more than the minimum and $10,000 in bonus pay for high test scores or teaching in a geographic or subject area of high need. However, the bill also would repeal the state's minimum salary schedule for educators and the Teacher Fair Dismissal Act, a law that requires notice before a teacher can be fired. The bill also includes provisions for teacher recruitment, literacy coaches and tutors, a new diploma track for high school students who want to focus on studying a trade, enhanced security measures for schools and codification of Sanders' executive order banning Critical Race Theory. An amendment to the bill added back in language requiring teachers to be given "an opportunity for a hearing" in front of the school board before they can be fired. Before Wednesday's vote, committee members took turns reflecting on Tuesday's hearing, with several of those who voted for the bill saying they thought the process was rushed and the bill could be improved. Rep. Keith Brooks, the bill's House sponsor, told committee members during his closing remarks that the LEARNS Act was a "great starting point" and that they could continue to work through the session to better public education in Arkansas. "I think we have to remember LEARNS is not the end of the conversation, even in this legislative session," said Brooks, R-Little Rock. "It doesn't mean it's the end of the things we're going to do in education, the things we're going to do to impact our kids, the things we're going to do to consider the needs of teachers and people all over the state of Arkansas." The idea the bill could be further altered after its passage, if needed, was persuasive for some Republicans who said they had doubts about the bill. "I've had fears. I've had doubts," said Rep. DeAnn Vaught, R-Horatio. "I've had questions about this bill, but I'm trusting the sponsor that if there's problems with the bill and there's things that need to be changed that we'll work together to make sure that they get addressed and fixed at a very quick pace." Rep. Hope Duke, R-Gravette, said she had "some issues with the process" of the bill's passage but ultimately decided to support the bill. "We've got to get this right, and I'm trusting that we're going to get this right," Duke said.

        SPRINGDALE -- A Springdale police officer shot a teen in the head Wednesday morning after he pointed a gun at him, according to a release from Capt. Jeff Taylor. The department received a call around 12:50 a.m. Wednesday saying a woman had been shot on Eicher Avenue in Springdale. When officers arrived, they found Argentina Agee, 31, shot in the arm, according to the news release. Officers were told the suspect was in a blue Chevrolet Tahoe, which they found nearby in the driveway at 1115 Eicher Ave., the release states. Eicher Avenue is about two blocks from Murphy Park. Officers found a 17-year-old lying under a blanket in the back seat. An officer opened the rear passenger door and told him to show his hands, according to the the release. The teen began to sit up, and as he did, he pointed a pistol at the officer who then fired, hitting the teen in the head, according to the news release. The teen's identity isn't being released at this time, the release states. Officers began providing first aid to the teen and Agee until paramedics arrived on the scene. Both he and Agee were taken to local hospitals for their injuries, according to the release. The investigation of use of deadly force by the officer as well as the shooting of the woman is being handled by the Washington County Sheriff's Office. The officer has been placed on paid administrative leave, which is standard protocol pending the Sheriff's Office investigation as well as an internal investigation, the release states. This is the second time in the last two weeks an officer has fired his weapon at a suspect near Murphy Park. Police received a call about 6 p.m. Feb. 15 from a woman saying Ethan Brasel, 20, wouldn't get out of her car in the western parking lot of Murphy Park on South Pleasant Street, according to a department news release. The caller reported Brasel had a pistol in his front waistband and there was another gun in the car, police said. Officers said they found Brasel sitting in the front passenger seat of a white car. Officers ordered Brasel out of the car and asked if he had any weapons, the release says. Brasel said he didn't have a weapon, but officers could see a rifle in the front passenger seat of the vehicle, the release says. Brasel ran when one of the officers began to pat him down in a search for weapons, police said. An officer yelled Brasel had a gun as police chased him west from the park, police said. An officer ordered Brasel to drop the gun, according to the release. An officer then fired his gun at Brasel but didn't hit him, the release said. The call about Tuesday's shooting came from a house at the intersection of Eicher and South Pleasant Street, a half-mile south of Murphy Park, which also is on Pleasant, the site of the Feb. 15 shooting. Taylor said the shootings aren't related. Kelly Cantrell, a spokesman for the Sheriff's Office, said the investigation of that incident is also continuing.

         The 49th annual Governor's Conference on Tourism came to a close Tuesday evening with the Henry Awards, where marketing professionals working in the tourism industry from across the state were recognized. Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders capped off the awards banquet, speaking about the role tourism plays in Arkansas's economy. "People are embracing the outdoors like never before. Our state's tourism industry grew by 23% last year alone as people found new ways to explore our beautiful, natural spaces," she said. "The tourism industry now contributes billions to our economy, invites millions of visitors to our state and employs well over 100,000 people." Tourism is second only to agriculture in driving the state's economy, she said, attributing its quick growth, in part, to her father, former Gov. Mike Huckabee, who, in the first months of his tenure as the state's top executive, boated the length of the Arkansas River in support of raising the state sales tax to improve the state's park system. "Inevitably, whenever I strike up a conversation with someone that is involved in this industry in our state, most of them all have the same story to tell. It's about my parents; my parents, not too long ago, went on an adventure to promote Arkansas tourism," Sanders said, noting that while her dad took a bass boat down the river, her mother rode a jet ski. "Thankfully, my parents' ride did the trick, and that proposal passed by statewide referendum and it has fueled Arkansas parks tourism and outdoor recreation ever since," she continued. These days, her husband is the one promoting the Natural State. Bryan Sanders was recently named by the governor to the newly-formed Natural State Advisory Council, and he will be visiting all 52 of Arkansas's state parks this year to promote outdoor recreation in the state. Also on the Council is Mindy West, chief financial officer at Murphy USA. "Bryan likes to talk a lot about our state's unique selling proposition. We both agree that it's 'the Natural State,'" Sanders said. "It drives growth. It revives out-of-the-way communities and helps put our state on the map as the best place, not only to visit, but to live, to work and to raise a family." This year was the first time the tourism conference has ever been held in El Dorado, and Sander said it was a good opportunity for the city to showcase what it has to offer. "It's not at all hard to see why people from all across the country are discovering the magic that Arkansas has to offer," she said. "Here in El Dorado, you certainly outkick your coverage, with one of the liveliest art districts in the region." In the coming years, Sanders said she hopes to see the tourism industry grow even more. "We're going to aggressively market the Natural State. From amazing food and beverage and warm, Southern hospitality to world-class museums like Crystal Bridges and the soon-to-be open Arkansas Fine Arts Museum – our state needs to be on every single person's travel bucket list," she said. "Arkansas's natural beauty is a glimpse of heaven, and I want all of the world to discover what we in this room already know: Arkansas is God's country." HONOREES The Henry Awards, named after explorer Henri de Tonti, "recognize outstanding accomplishments in Arkansas's tourism industry," and are presented annually during the Governor's Conference on Tourism by the Arkansas Department of Parks, Heritage and Tourism. Up for grabs Tuesday were the Natural State Tourism Development Award; Tourism Organization of the Year award; Tourism Attraction of the Year award; Rising Star Award; Tourism Region of the Year award; and the Tourism Person of the Year award. Nominees for the tourism development award were Beans, Greens & Cornbread/Delta Roots Music Fest, presented by the Helena-West Helena; Experience Fayetteville's ArtCourt; and Railyard Park & Butterfield Stage, presented by Rogers. Experience Fayetteville took home the Henry. "(The ArtCourt is) a place where art and play converge to create an immense and experimental community space," said Mike Mills, secretary of the Dept. of Parks, Heritage and Tourism, who presented the awards Tuesday. Experience Fayetteville also took home the Tourism Organization of the Year award. Their competitors included the North Little Rock Convention & Visitors Bureau and the Searcy Regional Chamber of Commerce. "Experience Fayetteville ... (filled) 2022 with innovative initiatives and events, setting the city apart from peers, drawing visitors from around the state, nation and world," Mills said. The Tourism Attraction of the Year award went to the Delta Dirt Distillery, based in Helena-West Helena, which garnered a standing ovation upon the announcement of their win. Also nominated were the Buffalo National River and the Museum of Discovery in Little Rock. Mills described the distillery as "a catalyst for the redevelopment of the downtown Harrison-Helena and positioning itself as a highly visible tourism attraction to the state and world." The Rising Star Award was presented to Grace Pepler, of the Dogwood Hills Guest Farm. The other finalists for the award were Lacey Hendrix, of the Beard and Lady Inn, and Luke Wiggins, of Visit Rogers. Mills said Pepler has been "a member of Arkansas's agritourism industry from a young age" and that she also recently opened the state's first "micro-dairy." Arkansas Delta Byways won the Tourism Region of the Year award, beating out the only other finalist for the honor, the Arkansas River Valley Tri-Peaks. The Tourism Person of the Year award went to Norma Sims, a tourism ambassador for Explore Harrison. Sims also received a standing ovation, including from several prior Tourism Person of the Year winners, like Madison Murphy of El Dorado. "I love it," Sims said. "Thank y'all so much. I'm too nervous to talk. Thank y'all." Tuesday evening's event concluded with a performance by Capitol Offense, former Gov. Mike Huckabee's band. Murphy joined the band on-stage, playing guitar and singing The Band's "The Weight." CONFERENCE IMPACTS Beth Brumley, executive director of Main Street El Dorado, who sat on the conference planning committee, said she thinks the three-day event was a success. "Everyone on the committee thinks it did exactly what we were hoping it would do, which is bring hundreds of people to El Dorado, several of whom had never been before, and show them all our assets and what we have to offer," she said. "We squeezed a lot into four days." The Conference started on Sunday, when attendees were treated to a concert by the South Arkansas Symphony Orchestra and saw some of El Dorado's local art, including an exhibit from the South Arkansas Arts Center and a demonstration by artists-in-education Jorge and Maria Botti Villegas. On Monday, attendees got the chance to learn more about El Dorado through an introductory meeting, then attended tourism, marketing and branding-related workshops throughout the day before getting a "Taste of El Dorado" at the Union County Courthouse, where they had the opportunity to sample local cuisine. Workshops and roundtable discussions continued on Tuesday, and the event came to a close with the Henry Awards and closing reception. Brumley said she thinks the conference gave the state as a whole a new impression of El Dorado. She said the Department of Parks, Heritage and Tourism may consider holding Destination Downtown, a tri-state tourism conference, there in 2025. Some local businesses have also already seen the economic impact of the conference. Brumley said several of the tourism officials she knows told her they shopped local during their stays in El Dorado. "I know several of the boutiques had several people in them -- Sports Alley, Shelly's Shoes," she said. With Shamrockin' on the Square, scheduled for March 11, quickly approaching, Brumley said that while she's glad the conference was held here, now that it's over, she's taking a short break before getting back to work to prepare for the St. Patrick's Day event.   Gallery: 2023 Henry Awards  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        The family of Quintin Miller, the 17-year-old killed in a Camden shooting last week, held a press conference on the lawn of the Ouachita County Courthouse Wednesday afternoon, calling for justice and harsher sentences for the individuals allegedly involved in the shooting. Ebony Gulley, who is a public defender and a family member of Miller said, "We're here for a very serious matter. Exactly one week ago today, the life of Quintin Miller was tragically stolen from him, his family and this community. The probable cause affidavit reads that 'at approximately 3:15 officers (responded)' ... That means that exactly seven days ago, at this exact moment, Quintin was fighting to live. He did not survive." Quintin's father, Torrey Miller, called for Prosecutor Margaret Wynne to seek first-degree murder charges in the shooting. Camden Police Sergeant Ashley Watts, when asked about the investigation, said, "We're still investigating. Everything is still being looked into right now." Gulley ended the press conference saying that, as a public defender, she has recused herself from representing two suspects allegedly involved in the shooting and reiterated the call for more serious charges against them. She opened the conference by saying the family held it to talk about who Quintin is, not who he was. Bishop Robert Arnold delivered a prayer and spoke about mentoring Quintin in Camden Public Schools. Miller's sister Trinity Clary said, "Quintin was a very genuine and positive person. He never got into any trouble in school or any trouble outside of school. If you knew him, you knew he had such a beautiful spirit, and he was a respectful young man. What happened to him due to this fatal altercation is downright disgusting to me." Clary added, "We are pressing for maximum charges and the correct punishment for the young men who did this and who were involved in this fatal altercation." Another sister, Karissma Clary, stated, "My brother Quintin was such a genuine, kind-hearted person, so laid back and cool, wouldn't hurt a soul but would stand on what's right. Quintin had dreams and his whole life ahead of him, and all that was taken away from him too soon. He loved playing football. He was just telling me that he made varsity team. He was so excited to start back playing football again." She spoke of Miller's aspirations to get his commercial driver's license and open a trucking company to earn money for his family. Karissma also said, "I would like to respectfully speak on [Camden Police Department] -- my family and I would love to get more and better updates on this case. We feel we have the right to know." Watts also invited anyone with information to call the Camden Police Department. Jada Sims, another of Quintin's sisters, asked anyone with information on the shooting to report it to police and said a bank account in her name at Generations had been opened up to help with funeral costs for the family. Quintin's father, Torrey Miller said, "No parents should ever have to experience this or go through this. We're here to speak about Quintin -- the beacon of bright light he was and is. He won't be forgotten... He was a hero to me. He was a better man than me at age 17. I feel like I let him down. I feel like I broke a promise to him."

        FAYETTEVILLE -- A City Council committee wants to find a balance between a private property owner's desire to provide a safe place for unsheltered residents to live and preserving the well-being of neighbors. Members of the council's Ordinance Review Committee on Wednesday heard from Richard Tiffany, who owns property on South Lt. Col. Leroy Pond Avenue, immediately north of the Fayetteville National Cemetery. Tiffany has allowed people experiencing homelessness to live on the property for about a dozen years. The city recently received complaints about disturbances, trash, odors and other nuisances associated with the property. Tiffany said only a couple unsheltered residents stayed on the property most of the time, but within the last few years, the population has grown to 10 or 12. The city issued a code violation letter in October, saying a campground was operating within a property zoned for multifamily residential use. Campgrounds are considered a conditional citywide land use under city code, which requires a permit. However, there is no definition of campground in city code. The letter said Tiffany either needed to get a conditional use permit from the Planning Commission or cease using the property as a campground. Tiffany suggested changing the definition of a citywide conditional land use in city code to apply only to business use, where money is exchanged. Residents who stay on Tiffany's property live there for free. However, the current definition of a conditional citywide land use includes more than just campgrounds. It also includes airports, flying fields and heliports; recycling drop-off; solid waste and recreational vehicle sewage disposal; carnivals, circuses and tent revivals; and schools and churches. If the city were to adopt Tiffany's suggested change, it could enable residents to use their property for any of those uses as long as money is not exchanged, said Jonathan Curth, the city's development services director. For instance, someone could conceivably use their yard as a heliport, carnival or solid waste disposal without a permit as long as money wasn't exchanged. Police Capt. Brad Renfro said the department has responded to a number of calls at the property over the years. Since 2013, there have been 328 police calls for service and 149 fire calls, totaling 447. In 2021, there were 27 disturbance calls, nine last year and five so far this year, he said. A stabbing was reported last July. Other call types last year included 911 hangup, shots heard, theft, threat, welfare concern, noise, loud party and trespassing, Renfro said, in addition to officer-initiated calls. Tiffany said most of the people who stay at his property are women, some of whom have been there more than a year. Women experiencing homelessness have difficulty finding a safe place to live, he said. "They are there because it's the safest place they can find in town," Tiffany said. Tiffany said he checks in on the property two to six days per week. He said many of the complaints come from people visiting the nearby cemetery. City Council members on the committee are D'Andre Jones, Sarah Moore, Scott Berna and Holly Hertzberg. Berna said he was worried about the potential ramifications of changing city code like how Tiffany suggested. "I applaud you for what you're trying to do and the heart that you have for individuals in a bad situation," Berna told Tiffany. "But in this particular case, I'm struggling to change that definition and open that door to something I think is problematic." Jones said he has received numerous calls from neighbors with concerns about the property, and the council needs to strike a balance. "That's my priority -- making sure that we do have a safe place for the homeless community members, but also making sure that the well-being of our neighbors is not compromised," he said. The committee asked Curth to come up with some potential code changes and definitions for a campground. The group plans to discuss the matter again at 5 p.m. March 15.

         Three members of a Hot Springs drug trafficking organization were sentenced Tuesday in Hot Springs to federal prison terms of 10, 15 and almost 20 years, respectively, for crimes related to meth distribution, according to a news release from U.S. Attorney David Clay Fowlkes of the Western District of Arkansas. Jose Luis Aguilar, 61, and Eric Alexi Aguilar, 25, both of Houston, Texas, were each indicted on one count of conspiracy to distribute meth and one count of aiding and abetting in the possession with the intent to distribute 500 grams or more of a mixture or substance containing meth. James Franklin Wells Jr., 60, of Hot Springs, was indicted on one count of possession with intent to distribute more than 50 grams of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of meth. Jose Aguilar was sentenced to 19 years and seven months followed by five years of supervised release; Eric Aguilar was sentenced to 10 years followed by five years of supervised release; and Wells was sentenced to 15 years followed by four years of supervised release. All three will have to serve 85% of their sentences before they are eligible for parole. All three were sentenced Tuesday in U.S. District Court, by Chief Judge Susan O. Hickey. According to court documents, in 2020, DEA agents began investigating a drug trafficking organization operating within the Western District of Arkansas, Hot Springs Division. During the course of their investigation, they identified Jose Aguilar as the leader of this group, and said he regularly supplied narcotics to multiple dealers in the Hot Springs area between July 29, 2020, through at least Sept. 25, 2020. The DEA, Homeland Security Investigations Little Rock, the Hot Springs Police Department, the 18th Judicial District East Drug Task Force and the Garland County prosecutor's office investigated the case, which was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Bryan Achorn and Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Trent Daniels.

         Visit Hot Springs has released the lineup for the "First Ever 20th Annual World's Shortest St. Patrick's Day Parade." It's a mix of new entries and longtime crowd favorites that includes floats, bands, dancers, strutters, leprechauns and "assorted wacky participants." The entry deadline for parade participants was Wednesday, but the lineup was filled ahead of the deadline, Alexis Hampo, special events manager for Visit Hot Springs, said in a news release. "We have some really exciting entries this year," Hampo said. "Some have been participating in the parade for years and others are brand new to Bridge Street. I am thrilled to see all the creative, green and St. Pat's-themed floats and groups coming to celebrate the 20th year of our tiny and wonderful parade." New this year will be the Rusty Nail Line Dancers, a square dance group. "We are very excited to be participating in the parade," Tonja Bolding said in the release. "Five of the dancers were in the parade approximately 10 years ago with our original teacher, who unfortunately is recovering from multiple strokes. We want to dedicate this experience and our performance to our beloved Jerri Hendrix Priddy. I now teach this class out of love, respect and admiration for her and everything she taught me." The Spa City St. Paddy Wagon, famous for throwing hamburgers to the crowd, is also returning. "It has been a privilege to be a part of the annual World's Shortest St. Patrick's Day Parade. The families on our float have gotten to see our children enjoy the tremendous thrill of tossing thousands of items and hundreds of hamburgers over the past five years to our wonderful community of Hot Springs," Paddy Wagon's Dennis P. Berry said in the release. "We have gotten more thrills and great memories than we ever imagined, and we can't wait to unveil the new Spa City St. Paddy Wagon." Perennial parade favorite the International Order of the Irish Elvi (Hot Springs Chapter), a group of Irish-themed Elvis impersonators, is also returning with "A Smorgasbord of Elvi." New entries include The Cousin O'Eddies, a tribute to the Randy Quaid character Cousin Eddie from "National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation," with the Central High School Kiltie Drum and Bugle Corps from Springfield, Mo., an all-female kilt-wearing marching group that is the oldest such outfit in the nation. The final lineup for the 20th Annual Parade, which will be held March 17 on Bridge Street, includes the following:  A free public concert will be held on the Bridge Street Stage immediately following the parade, by The Molly Ringwalds. On Saturday, March 18, the "Second Ever Zero-K World's Shortest St. Patrick's Footrace," starting on Bridge Street and going 299 feet to O'Kelley's World's Biggest Inflatable Irish Pub across the street, will be held in the afternoon, followed by a free public concert on the Bridge Street Stage by the 1970s band Village People in the evening.
